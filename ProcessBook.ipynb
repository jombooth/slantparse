        "\u2014By Ian Gordon| Fri Nov. 14, 2014 12:19 PM ESTTweetEmail EFE/ZUMA The details of President Barack Obama's much-rumored, much-debated executive action on immigration have been leaked to the press, and the broad outline, according to Fox News and the New York Times, includes deportation relief for upward of 5 million people.\n",
        "Republicans are already lining up to block the White House's plans, and Obama's successor could go ahead and reverse course in 2017, anyway. Still, here are three reported provisions that could have a dramatic impact on the lives of the United States' 11 million undocumented immigrants:\n",
        "1. Expansion of DACA, the program for DREAMers: Back in 2012, a Department of Homeland Security directive known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) extended deportation relief to those young immigrants who came to the United States before their 16th birthday and went on to graduate from high school or serve in the US military. As Vox's Dara Lind has reported, the program has been a success for the roughly 600,000 immigrants who received deferred action by June 2014, although just as many are eligible but haven't yet applied. According to the Fox News report, Obama's executive action would move the cutoff arrival date from June 2007 to January 1, 2010, and remove the age limit (31 as of June '12); a new Migration Policy Institute (MPI) report details how changes to the initial plan could make hundreds of thousands of immigrants DACA-eligible:\n",
        "\n",
        "Migration Policy Institute, 2014\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Relief for the undocumented parents of US citizen children: According to the Times, a key part of the executive action \"will allow many parents of children who are American citizens or legal residents to obtain legal work documents and no longer worry about being discovered, separated from their families and sent away,\" a move that would legalize anywhere from 2.5-3.3 million people. The Huffington Post reported in June that more than 72,000 parents of US-born children were deported in fiscal year 2013 alone; of those, nearly 11,000 had no criminal convictions. (One 2013 report estimated that 4.5 million US-born kids have at least one undocumented parent.)\n",
        "3. Elimination of mandatory fingerprinting program: Under Secure Communities, or S-Comm, immigrants booked into local jails have their fingerprints run through a Homeland Security database to check their legal status. (If they're unauthorized, they can be held by local authorities until the feds come pick them up.) The program, which began under President George W. Bush and was greatly expanded under Obama, has long come under fire for quickly pushing people toward detention and potential deportation, as well as for contributing to racial profiling and even the detention of thousands of US citizens. According to one 2013 report, S-Comm led to the deportation of more than 300,000 immigrants from fiscal years 2009 to 2013.\n",
        "There are other reported parts to Obama's plan, including hundreds of thousands of new tech visas and even pay raises for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. Still, given this year's border crisis, it's notable that the president's plan seems to make little to no mention of the folks who provoked it: the unaccompanied children and so-called \"family units\" (often mothers traveling with small kids) who came in huge numbers from Central America and claimed, in many cases, to be fleeing violence of some sort.\n",
        "The administration has been particularly adamant about fast-tracking the deportation of those family unit apprehensions, whose numbers jumped from 14,855 in fiscal 2013 to 68,445 in fiscal 2014, a 361 percent increase. Meanwhile, ICE has renewed the controversial practice of family detention (a complaint has already been filed regarding sexual abuse in the new Karnes City, Texas, facility) and will soon open the largest immigration detention facility in the country, a 2,400-bed family center in Dilley, Texas\u2014just as Obama starts rolling out what many immigration hardliners will no doubt attack as an unconstitutional amnesty.\n",

        "\u2014By Andy Kroll | Fri Nov. 21, 2014 6:00 AM ESTTweetEmailNorth Carolina's heavily gerrymandered 12th congressional district. Over the past four to five years, the United States has been resegregated\u2014politically. In states where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans and presidential races can be nail-biters, skillful Republican operatives have mounted racially-minded gerrymandering efforts\u2014the redrawing of congressional and state legislative districts\u2014that have led to congressional delegations stacked with GOP members and yielded Republican majorities in the state legislatures.\n",
        "In North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, to name just three, GOPers have recast state and congressional districts to consolidate black voters into what the political pros call \"majority-minority districts\" to diminish the influence of these voters. North Carolina is an especially glaring example: GOP-redistricting after the 2010 elections led to half the state's black population\u20141.1 million people\u2014being corralled into one-fifth of the state legislative and congressional districts. \"The districts here take us back to a day of segregation that most of us thought we'd moved away from,\" State Sen. Dan Blue Jr., who was previously North Carolina's first black House speaker, told the Nation in 2012.\n",
        "A major driving force behind this political resegregation is the Republican State Leadership Committee, a deep-pocketed yet under-the-radar group that calls itself the \"lead Republican redistricting organization.\" The RSLC is funded largely by Fortune 500 corporations, including Reynolds American, Las Vegas Sands, Walmart, Devon Energy, Citigroup, AT&T, Pfizer, Altria Group, Honeywell International, Hewlett-Packard. Other heavyweight donors not on the Fortune 500 list include Koch Industries, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and the US Chamber of Commerce. At the same time these big-name firms underwrite the RSLC's efforts to dilute the power of black voters, many of them preach the values of diversity and inclusion on their websites and in corporate reports.\n",
        "As part of its Redistricting Majority Project\u2014which, tellingly, is nicknamed REDMAP\u2014the RSLC, starting in 2010, poured tens of millions of dollars into legislative races around the country to elect new GOP majorities. Next it provided money and expertise to state officials redrawing political boundary lines to favor the Republican Party\u2014and to shrink the clout of blacks, Hispanics, and other traditionally Democratic voters. Unlike its Democratic equivalent, the RSLC has vast sums at its disposal, spending $30 million during the 2010 elections, $40 million in 2012, and $22 million in 2014.\n",
        "Here is a partial list of RSLC donors\u2014how much they donated to the group in the past four years and what they each have had to say about their own efforts to foster diversity.

G-men, cops, and Homeland Security can't wait to see it everywhere.\u2014By Shane Bauer | Thu Nov. 20, 2014 6:30 AM ESTTweetEmail Illustration: Dan BejarRobert Schueren shook my hand firmly, handed me his business card, and flipped it over, revealing a short list of letters and numbers. \"Here is my DNA profile.\" He smiled. \"I have nothing to hide.\" I had come to meet Schueren, the CEO of IntegenX, at his company's headquarters in Pleasanton, California, to see its signature product: a machine the size of a large desktop printer that can unravel your genetic code in the time it takes to watch a movie.\n",
        "Schueren grabbed a cotton swab and dropped it into a plastic cartridge. That's what, say, a police officer would use to wipe the inside of your cheek to collect a DNA sample after an arrest, he explained. Other bits of material with traces of DNA on them, like cigarette butts or fabric, could work too. He inserted the cartridge into the machine and pressed a green button on its touch screen: \"It's that simple.\" Ninety minutes later, the RapidHIT 200 would generate a DNA profile, check it against a database, and report on whether it found a match.\n",
        "\n",
        "A scanner, quickly: The RapidHIT 200 can generate a DNA profile in about 90 minutes. IntegenX\n",
        "\n",
        "The RapidHIT represents a major technological leap\u2014testing a DNA sample in a forensics lab normally takes at least two days. This has government agencies very excited. The Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and the Justice Department funded the initial research for \"rapid DNA\" technology, and after just a year on the market, the $250,000 RapidHIT is already being used in a few states, as well as China, Russia, Australia, and countries in Africa and Europe.\n",
        "\"We're not always aware of how it's being used,\" Schueren said. \"All we can say is that it's used to give an accurate identification of an individual.\" Civil liberties advocates worry that rapid DNA will spur new efforts by the FBI and police to collect ordinary citizens' genetic code.\n",
        "The US government will soon test the machine in refugee camps in Turkey and possibly Thailand on families seeking asylum in the United States, according to Chris Miles, manager of the Department of Homeland Security's biometrics program. \"We have all these families that claim they are related, but we don't have any way to verify that,\" he says. Miles says that rapid DNA testing will be voluntary, though refusing a test could cause an asylum application to be rejected.\n",
        "\"We're not always aware of how it's being used. All we can say is that it's used to give an accurate identification of an individual.\"\n",
        "Miles also says that federal immigration officials are interested in using rapid DNA to curb trafficking by ensuring that children entering the country are related to the adults with them. Jeff Heimburger, the vice president of marketing at IntegenX, says the government has also inquired about using rapid DNA to screen green-card applicants. (An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman said he was not aware that the agency was pursuing the technology.)\n",
        "Meanwhile, police have started using rapid DNA in Arizona, Florida, and South Carolina. In August, sheriffs in Columbia, South Carolina, used a RapidHIT to nab an attempted murder suspect. The machine's speed provides a major \"investigative lead,\" said Vince Figarelli, superintendent of the Arizona Department of Public Safety crime lab, which is using a RapidHIT to compare DNA evidence from property crimes against the state's database of 300,000 samples. Heimburger notes that the system can also prevent false arrests and wrongful convictions: \"There is great value in finding out that somebody is not a suspect.\"\n",
        "But the technology is not a silver bullet for DNA evidence. The IntegenX executives brought up rape kits so often that it sounded like their product could make a serious dent in the backlog of half a million untested kits. Yet when I pressed Schueren on this, he conceded that the RapidHIT is not actually capable of processing rape kits since it can't discern individual DNA in commingled bodily fluids.\n",
        "Despite the new technology's crime-solving potential, privacy advocates are wary of its spread. If rapid-DNA machines can be used in a refugee camp, \"they can certainly be used in the back of a squad car,\" says Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"I could see that happening in the future as the prices of these machines go down.\"\n",
        "Democratic members of Congress have urged the FBI to look into the \"broad deployment\" of rapid DNA in police stations.\n",
        "Lynch is particularly concerned that law enforcement agencies will use the devices to scoop up and store ever more DNA profiles. Every state already has a forensic DNA database, and while these systems were initially set up to track convicted violent offenders, their collection thresholds have steadily broadened. Today, at least 28 include data from anyone arrested for certain felonies, even if they are not convicted; some store the DNA of people who have committed misdemeanors as well. The FBI's National DNA Index System has more than 11 million profiles of offenders plus 2 million people who have been arrested but not necessarily convicted of a crime.\n",
        "For its part, Homeland Security will not hang onto refugees' DNA records, insists Miles. (\"They aren't criminals,\" he pointed out.) However, undocumented immigrants in custody may be required to provide DNA samples, which are put in the FBI's database. DHS documents obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation say there may even be a legal case for \"mandating collection of DNA\" from anyone granted legal status under a future immigration amnesty. (The documents also state that intelligence agencies and the military are interested in using rapid DNA to identify sex, race, and other factors the machines currently do not reveal.)\n",
        "The FBI is the only federal agency allowed to keep a national DNA database. Currently, police must use a lab to upload genetic profiles to it. But that could change. The FBI's website says it is eager to see rapid DNA in wide use and that it supports the \"legislative changes necessary\" to make that happen. IntegenX's Heimburger says the FBI is almost finished working with members of Congress on a bill that would give \"tens of thousands\" of police stations rapid-DNA machines that could search the FBI's system and add arrestees' profiles to it. (The RapitHIT is already designed to do this.) IntegenX has spent $70,000 lobbying the FBI, DHS, and Congress over the last two years.\n",
        "The FBI declined to comment, and Heimburger wouldn't say which lawmakers might sponsor the bill. But some have already given rapid DNA their blessing. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a former prosecutor who represents the district where IntegenX is based, says he'd like to see the technology \"put to use quickly to help law enforcement\"\u2014while protecting civil liberties. In March, he and seven other Democratic members of Congress, including progressive stalwart Rep. Barbara Lee of California, urged the FBI to assess rapid DNA's \"viability for broad deployment\" in police departments across the country.\n",

        "George Church explains how genetic engineering could help eradicate some of the world's worst diseases.\u2014By Cynthia Graber | Fri Nov. 21, 2014 6:15 AM ESTTweetEmail abadonian/Thinkstock\n",
        "Malaria has long bedeviled those who have sought to eradicate it, particularly in Africa. According to the World Health Organization, in 2012, the disease caused an estimated 627,000 deaths\u2014the majority of those were African children. But now scientists are focusing on a promising new line of research: genetically manipulating the mosquitoes that carry the deadly illness.\n",
        "On this week's Inquiring Minds podcast, George Church\u2014a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and the author of Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves\u2014described the cutting-edge mosquito research that's taking place at his university in Massachusetts and around the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the past, scientists have attempted to control certain insect populations in part by irradiating the males, rendering them sterile. But that hasn't worked as well with mosquitoes as it did with other species, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly. Genetic engineering, Church says, offers a new, faster tool to more precisely target and create specific mutations. In June, a team of researchers published a paper in the journal Nature Communications that detailed a method by which mosquitoes were made to produce primarily male offspring. Male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar, not human blood, and thus don't transmit malaria. These mosquitos were shown to be able to interbreed with wild mosquitos (in cages), passing on their genetically engineered traits. Because they produce so few female offspring, whole mosquito populations could simply die off within a few generations.\n",
        "And in August, Church and his colleagues published papers in the journals Science and eLife describing how a new genetic engineering procedure called Crispr\u2014a tool borrowed from bacteria that enables much speedier and more precise genetic manipulation\u2014could be used to develop mutations in mosquitoes that could be spread throughout wild populations. One approach, for instance, is to create malaria-resistant mosquitoes, which would then pass the mutation down to subsequent generations. \"You don't have to affect that many species or sub-species,\" said Church, \"because not that many different types of mosquitoes carry the most dangerous types of malaria.\" This technique could also be useful for other insect-borne diseases, such as sleeping sickness, dengue fever, and Lyme disease.\n",
        "Church acknowledges that these ideas are controversial, to say the least. In-depth ecological research and detailed mosquito studies will be necessary to understand any potential unforeseen consequences before releasing genetically engineered mosquitoes into the wild. Such studies will evaluate what plants the mosquitoes (or other vectors) pollinate and whether other animals also pollinate the same plants. And they'll look at which fish, amphibians, and birds feed on the mosquitoes, and whether these animals have other food sources. Church hopes that the promise of a new weapon against malaria will motivate funders to support these kinds of studies. \"We need to fund these basic ecological studies at a higher level,\" he says. In addition, the initial attempts to implement this type of malaria-eradication system could take place in a bounded location, such as on an island.\n",
        "The technology poses other potential dangers, as well. As Church explains, genetic engineering tools are becoming so easy to use that they're accessible to practically any researcher who wants to utilize them. That's why Church and his colleagues have produced a series of journal articles that focus on precautionary policy components and specific regulations for the technology. \"Almost everybody has some species that they don't like,\" he says. \"Maybe it killed someone in their family. It doesn't mean you know immediately what to do with this powerful technology. Even if your goal is to rectify the situation, there are many ways to do it. We just need to be sure that people are thoughtful.\"\n",

The Birchers attempted to place their weight on \"the political scales\u2026as fast and as far\" as they could, but their movement was quickly sidelined to the ideological fringe. Two of Fred's four sons, Charles and David, have carried forward the conservative torch, and they have succeeded where their father and his allies failed. Their father's company, meanwhile, has grown into a multibillion-dollar conglomerate that is the second-largest private corporation in the country.\n",

A significant portion has gone to think tanks and policy institutes that advance the brothers' free-market beliefs. And Charles Koch has lavished millions on universities to bolster their study and teaching of this school of economics. But Koch contributions have also established cancer research centers, funded ballets and preserved cultural institutions, and provided grants and scholarships to students.\n",

        "In most states, sexual-assault survivors must come forward quickly\u2014or lose their chance at justice.\u2014By Jordan Michael Smith | Thu Nov. 20, 2014 6:00 AM ESTTweetEmailThe rape allegations against Bill Cosby most likely can no longer be prosecuted due to statutes of limitations. Matt Rourke/APOn January 23, 2014, Bart Bareither walked into the Marion County Sheriff's Department in Indianapolis. The 39-year-old computer engineer confessed to having raped a nursing student nine years earlier, while he was a teaching assistant at Indiana University. \"He had a sincere demeanor. His head was bowed. It was clearly eating at him; he was apologizing,\" recalls university detective Kimberly Minor, who was brought in to take his statement. Minor then contacted Jenny Wendt, who had been 26 at the time of the assault. She had not originally reported the crime because she thought it would be difficult to prove since she'd been on dates with Bareither. But even now, she soon learned, Bareither would not face any charges.\n",
        "Indiana law classifies sexual assaults into two categories: Class A felony rape, in which an assailant causes serious bodily injury, uses deadly force, or drugs the victim; and Class B felony rape, which includes other types of sexual assault. There is no statute of limitations for Class A offenses, so charges may be filed anytime after a crime is committed. The statute of limitations for Class B offenses\u2014like what happened to Wendt\u2014is five years. Minor says she and the Marion County prosecutor searched for a way to bring Bareither to trial, but it was soon clear that the opportunity had passed. \"I think he knew about the statute,\" Minor says. (Bareither did not respond to emails and calls from Mother Jones.)\n",
        "ad_code(\"middleros\", 170);Advertise on MotherJones.comIndiana's short window for bringing rape cases to trial is not unique. Nationwide, 34 states have statutes of limitations on filing rape or sexual-assault charges, ranging from 3 to 30 years. In New Hampshire, charges must be filed within six years of a crime; in Connecticut, it's five years. In Minnesota, it's three. Some states tie the statute of limitations to reporting deadlines. If a survivor in Illinois comes forward within three years, the state has 10 years to file charges. If she takes longer than that, the case dies.\n",
        "Twenty-seven states extend or suspend statutes of limitations if DNA evidence can identify a suspect, but these exemptions vary. Georgia puts no time limit on rape cases in which a DNA match has been made. In Indiana, prosecutors must charge a suspect within one year of a DNA match. In Connecticut, the crime must be initially reported within five years for any future DNA match to be considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Survivors and activists have campaigned to make these laws reflect changing attitudes toward sexual violence and improvements in investigating old cases. In 2008, Mel Townsend, a sophomore at the University of Kansas, was raped by a man who broke into her house in the middle of the night. She thought police would quickly find her attacker, suspected to be a serial rapist who had attacked a dozen other college students. \"I really didn't even have a ballpark idea of how long these types of things take to get resolved,\" she says.\n",
        "Four years went by. Then she met with a detective who told her there was just one year left to file charges. \"I was super angry. I walked out and told my mom, 'This is wrong,'\" she recalls. Townsend lobbied state legislators, who, in March 2013, unanimously eliminated Kansas' statute of limitations for all rape cases. \"It hadn't been changed before simply because most people were unaware that the statute even existed in the first place,\" Townsend says. Her attacker still has not been identified.\n",
        "\"Rape is a crime of shame and humiliation.\" Survivors may take years or decades to come forward.\n",
        "The issue received renewed attention last August, when, while campaigning for governor of Texas, Wendy Davis made an appearance with Lavinia Masters, who had been sexually assaulted in 1985. In 2005, after a months-long search, Masters' 20-year-old rape kit was found and tested for the first time. DNA in the kit matched that of a man who was already in prison for other offenses, including sexual assault. (Nationwide, as many as 500,000 rape kits currently remain untested.) But the suspect couldn't be charged because Texas' 10-year statute of limitations had run out. Davis proposed ending the state's statute of limitations for rape altogether. Pressed on the issue, Texas Attorney General (now Gov.-elect) Greg Abbott endorsed Davis' plan. (The recently resurfaced rape allegations against Bill Cosby have also put statutes of limitations in the spotlight; it appears that the alleged incidents can no longer be prosecuted.)\n",
        "\"In some cases, these laws have been around for centuries,\" says Scott Berkowitz, the founder and president of the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, which tracks statutes of limitations. Historically, homicide has been the only crime for which there is no expiration date for filing charges. This was a reflection of murder's unique seriousness, but it also was meant to prevent the courts from getting clogged with lesser cases based on old memories and aging evidence. \"The concept of the statute of limitations is grounded in fairness,\" says Sandra Thompson, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney who now teaches law at the University of Houston. \"Most of us can't remember what we ate last week\u2014it's hard to remember something that happened years ago.\"\n",
        "More: A history of men defining rape\n",
        "The idea behind imposing short statutes of limitations on rape cases in particular can be traced back to English common law. Under the doctrine of the \"fresh complaint rule,\" rape victims were obligated to raise a \"hue and cry\" immediately after being attacked; waiting too long to lodge a complaint would invalidate the charge. As influential 17th-century British jurist Sir Matthew Hale argued, \"the party ravished\" must promptly pursue justice; \"otherwise it carries a presumption that her suit is but malicious and feigned.\"\n",
        "Skeptics say that extending or abolishing statutes of limitations won't bring many more rapists to justice. \"Most rape cases come down to a question of sexual consent. They are 'he said/she said,'\" says Amanda Peters, a former Houston prosecutor who teaches at the South Texas College of Law. And as any viewer of The First 48 knows, the longer a case goes unsolved, the less likely it will ever be closed. \"Memories worsen, juries get more skeptical,\" Peters says.\n",
        "In English common law,\u00a0 victims had to raise a \"hue and cry\" after being attacked; waiting too long would invalidate the charge.\n",
        "Yet that principle overlooks what we now know about the profound emotional and social barriers to reporting sexual violence. \"Rape is a crime of shame and humiliation,\" explains Marci Hamilton, an expert on statutes of limitations who teaches law at Yeshiva University. Survivors may take years or decades to come forward. The majority of sexual assaults go unreported, most commonly because victims say they fear reprisals or think they won't be believed.\n",
        "Short statutes of limitations also do not take into account the investigative failures that have derailed many cases. In 2003, a masked man raped 16-year-old Meaghan Ybos at knifepoint inside her Memphis home. Her rape kit sat untested for nearly a decade until 2012, when it was matched with the DNA of a serial rapist. In March 2013, Anthony Alliano pleaded guilty to raping Ybos and six other women and was sentenced to 178 years in prison. Ybos and two of Alliano's other victims are suing the city of Memphis, which has more than 12,000 untested or undertested rape kits in storage, some dating back to the 1970s.\n",
        "Ybos, whose case was resolved before a 15-year statute of limitations for aggravated rape expired, also campaigned to change the law. She initially encountered indifference and hostility. \"Officials didn't want to address the problems with rape,\" she says. She helped write a law, passed last spring, abolishing time limits on prosecuting rape in Tennessee.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jenny Wendt has been campaigning to lift Indiana's statute of limitations for sexual assaults. Photo: Leah Nash\n",
        "\n",
        "Following Bart Bareither's confession, Jenny Wendt began a campaign to change Indiana's laws, addressing rallies and meeting with legislators. \"Frankly, I was a bit surprised that rape had a statute of just five years,\" says Republican state Sen. Michael Crider, who plans to introduce a bill extending or abolishing the time limits on prosecuting rape. State Rep. Christina Hale, a Democrat working with Crider, says the bill's critics claim it will lead to a witch hunt for perpetrators. But considering the trauma and stigma that prevent rape survivors from immediately coming forward, she says, \"five years is just not a long enough time.\"\n",
        "Until recently, Wendt lived less than 10 minutes away from Bareither, \"terrified of him and to know he's still thinking about it.\" A change in the law won't resolve her case, but that's not what's driving her. \"My sole purpose from the beginning is to ensure that nothing like this happens to anyone ever again,\" she says. \"We are way behind the times.\"\n",

The four-count indictment describes a culture of negligence under Blankenship's watch, in which essential safety measures were ignored as the company sought to squeeze every last cent out of the ground. Blankenship, who left Massey in 2010, pleaded not guilty Thursday.\n",
        "But the indictment also came as a sobering reminder: In the four years since the disaster, little has been done to make the mining industry safer. Legislation designed to rein in the worst offenders and give regulators teeth was beaten back by big business. Meanwhile, tens of millions of dollars in safety fines have gone uncollected.\n",
        "\"We've taken some actions after the various accidents that have taken place, but unfortunately, Congress can apparently only legislate in this area after someone dies,\" said Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), who sponsored mine-safety legislation in the wake of the Upper Big Branch explosion.\n",
        "\"I've been there after the accidents, I've been standing with many of these politicians\u2014they all pledge they're gonna do something for the families, that they care about the miners. And then everybody goes back to business as usual.\"\n",
        "ad_code(\"middleros\", 170);Advertise on MotherJones.comTo understand just how little has changed, you need look no further than the indictment itself, which alleges that Massey's CEO actively blocked safety improvements at Upper Big Branch even as it racked up hundreds of citations for its ventilation system and combustible coal dust. It's quite damning, but under the Mine Safety Act, conspiring to violate mine safety standards is only a misdemeanor. It's almost impossible for a mine operator to be charged with a felony under current law. (That's why the most serious charges in the Blankenship indictment concern false statements allegedly made to the Securities Exchange Commission.)\n",
        "Congress had a chance to fix that three years ago, when Miller introduced the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act, named for the late West Virginia senator. It was a comprehensive response that proposed to expand criminal penalties for negligent mine owners, protect whistleblowers, and make it easier for regulators to shut down the industry's worst offenders. The bill would also have created stricter requirements for cleaning up combustible coal dust, which was the immediate cause of the UBB explosion, according to the state's investigation. In addition, the legislation would have expanded federal officials' subpoena power when investigating accidents or allegations. (Kentucky legislators, hardly enemies of the coal industry, made subpoena power for the state's Mine Safety Review Commission a central part of their 2007 reform.)\n",
        "\"Some of these places have essentially become a criminal enterprise,\" says Rep. George Miller.\n",
        "\"Some of these places have essentially become a criminal enterprise,\" Miller said. \"You've gotta have subpoena power when you're investigating companies that have made a conscious decision to knowingly risk the lives of their employees.\"\n",
        "Miller's bill had backing from coal-country lawmakers such as West Virginia Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall, but it fell short on the floor after a furious lobbying effort from the National Association of Manufacturers and the US Chamber of Commerce. A subsequent version of the bill died in committee, and now Miller, Congress' loudest voice on the issue, is retiring in December. As it stands, the only piece of mining safety legislation that passed after the Upper Big Branch disaster wasn't really mining legislation at all\u2014it was section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, which required publicly traded mining companies to include health and safety updates in their annual SEC filings.\n",
        "Mine-safety advocates have praised the response of Mine Safety and Health Administration, a branch of the Department of Labor that oversees the coal industry. In 2013, it announced it would finally take advantage of a 1977 rule mandating that companies with a \"pattern of violation\" close specific portions of their mine until they fixed their safety issues. But that rule just suffered a legal setback. And even when companies rack up fines for serious infractions, MSHA lacks the tools to collect them. A recent investigation by NPR found that coal companies owed a combined $70 million in delinquent fines stemming from 2,700 different violations.\n",
        "\"These politicians\u2026 all pledge they're gonna do something for the families, that they care about the miners,\" says Miller. \"And then everybody goes back to business as usual.\"\n",
        "At the state level, it's been mostly the same story. West Virginia Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's most ambitious proposal in response to the Upper Big Branch explosion was a new rule requiring mine workers to take drug tests\u2014even though none of the post-incident reports suggested drug or alcohol use had been a contributing factor in the explosion, and most mines already required them. The law also increased the maximum amount that a mine operator could be fined for a safety violation\u2014to $5,000.\n",
        "There's another common denominator in the safety violations and lack of accountability, one that no legislation or bureaucratic rulemaking is likely to offset: unionized mines in Appalachia are an endangered species. None of Eastern Kentucky's coal mines are unionized. And increasingly, neither are their counterparts in West Virginia.\n",
        "The depletion of easy-to-access coal reserves has meant that larger corporations are being replaced by smaller, more aggressive companies that are chasing ever-shrinking profit margins in increasingly out-of-the-way places. \"Only about 25 percent of the mines that were open in Kentucky three years ago are still open today,\" notes Tony Oppegard, a mine safety advocate in Eastern Kentucky. It's not the kind of environment where best practices are honed. And those workers are increasingly operating without a safety net.\n",
        "This wasn't an accident. You could argue it was part of an effort that began in 1984, when the new president of a Massey Energy subsidiary in Mingo County, West Virginia, decided to break the back of the United Mine Workers' local. He locked workers out and bussed in non-unionized replacements. And after a year of threats and stonewalling, Don Blankenship won.\n",

It was interesting but unsurprising: the biggest states (California, Texas, Florida, New York) also have the most unauthorized immigrants. This got me curious about which states had the highest percentages of unauthorized immigrants\u2014which the Pew map also provides. The answer is in the chart below.\n",
        "For what it's worth, I thought the most striking thing was the fact that for all the sound and fury illegal immigration provokes, it turns out that there are only seven states in which unauthorized immigrants make up more than 4 percent of the population. In the vast majority of the country, they're a vanishingly small group.\n",

        "Fri Nov. 21, 2014 12:25 PM ESTTweetEmail  White House/Flickr President Barack Obama, who has issued fewer executive orders than any president since Grover Cleveland, issued a set of directives this week to protect 5 million undocumented residents from deportation. The new executive actions will allow undocumented parents of US citizens to stay in the country, and allow children who were brought to the United States by their parents to apply for employment visas. It also, according to various Republican critics, cements Obama's status as a dictator, a king, an emperor, and maybe even a maniac bent on ethnic cleansing:\n",
        "Obama is a king. \"The president acts like he's a king,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said. \"He ignores the Constitution. He arrogantly says, 'If Congress will not act, then I must.' These are not the words of a great leader. These are the words that sound more like the exclamations of an autocrat.\"\n",
        "This will lead to anarchy. \"The country's going to go nuts, because they're going to see it as a move outside the authority of the president, and it's going to be a very serious situation,\" retiring Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) told USA Today. \"You're going to see\u2014hopefully not\u2014but you could see instances of anarchy. ... You could see violence.\"\n",
        "He could go to jail. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told Slate that the president might be committing a felony: \"At some point, you have to evaluate whether the president's conduct aids or abets, encourages, or entices foreigners to unlawfully cross into the United States of America. That has a five-year in-jail penalty associated with it.\"\n",
        "Is ethnic cleansing next? When asked by a talk-radio called on Thursday if the new executive actions would lead to \"ethnic cleansing,\" Kansas Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach said it just might:\n",
        "\n",
        "What protects us in America from any kind of ethnic cleansing is the rule of law, of course. And the rule of law used to be unassailable, used to be taken for granted in America. And now, of course, we have a President who disregards the law when it suits his interests. And, so, you know, while I normally would answer that by saying, 'Steve, of course we have the rule of law, that could never happen in America,' I wonder what could happen. I still don't think it\u2019s going to happen in America, but I have to admit, that things are, things are strange and they're happening.\n",
        "\n",
        "Kobach is hardly a fringe figure. He was the architect of the self-deportation strategy at the core some of the nation's harshest immigration laws.\n",

        "\"There are only three ways to get land,\" said Tony Cerda, chairman of the Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe, in 2010. \"You can buy it, have it given to you, or steal it.\" It's clear which one of those applies to his people, the Ohlone, who lived in the central California coastal region for thousands of years prior to the arrival of Spanish missionaries in the 1700s. The Ohlone once numbered as many as 15,000 on lands stretching from the San Francisco Bay to Big Sur. But following years of enslavement under the Spanish mission system and, later, persecution by settlers, they are now largely a people in exile.\n",
        "Cerda's tribe\u2014about 2,000 people living in the Pomona area east of Los Angeles\u2014are now the largest contemporary Ohlone group in the state. They're leading the push for cultural recognition in the city of San Francisco. Specifically, they're asking the city for land to build a cultural center as part of a proposed shoreline redevelopment project in the Hunters Point Shipyard area. The area was once the location of a historic Ohlone village and burial site\u2014one of over 425 in the San Francisco Bay region.\n",
        "Ohlone leaders say a cultural center would highlight the oft-overlooked history of California's native people while serving as a permanent place for today's tribes to continue their song, dance, language, and art traditions. And they're also hoping to rebuild their cultural presence through community events like the annual Big Time Gathering, which took place in October in San Francisco's Presidio National Park. This year's gathering was the biggest yet, drawing more than 100 Native Californians from seven different tribes. Their goal is to honor their roots, says Neil Maclean, one of the event's organizers: \"Through hearing them sing, seeing them dance, and joining with them in ceremony, the Ohlone will tell their side about what it is like to survive.\"\n",

        "In recent years, those \"gotcha\" moments have dominated countless headlines. And the news cycle is a familiar one: It starts with the internet discovering a person doing something, at best, racially insensitive, and at worst, blatantly racist. Outrage moves to social media where users are quick to ridicule the offender in question. The mounting anger is only quelled by a forced apology, firing, etc. But what happens after the hashtags stop trending? The conversations that follow don't exactly have the same viral potential and are rarely discussed.\n",
        "\"Critical analysis is of utmost importance whenever we talk about race in America,\" he said. And for Vargas, the way Americans currently discuss race is \"superficial and oversimplified.\"\u00a0But in a time when race is such a\u00a0loaded topic, this is increasingly problematic. That's exactly where the \"Untitled Whiteness Project\" comes in.\n",
        "The film is currently in its beginning stages and aligns with MTV's larger \"Look Different\" campaign, which explores hidden prejudices among millennials. The campaign recently partnered with David Binder Research for a study to examine how young people view their own identities and biases. Among\u00a0the white 18 to 24 year-olds who participated in the study, 48 percent\u00a0said discrimination against white people has emerged as just a serious problem as discrimination against people of color. Only 39 percent\u00a0believed white people had more advantages than people of color.\n",
        "Vargas wants to discuss these perspectives, shed light on hidden\u00a0biases, and perhaps even more importantly, create an open discourse for young people to\u00a0talk comfortably talk about race and their own identities without judgment.\n",
