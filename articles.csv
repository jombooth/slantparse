The American Conservative,C,What Not to Do on Iran | The American Conservative,"Michael Makovsky and Bill Kristol have some typically awful proposals for Iran policy:
Congress could immediately pass new and stronger sanctions legislation, which would seek to cut off all of Iran’s oil sales, a manageable prospect given the current global supply glut and the drop in oil prices of about 30 percent since the summer. Congress could pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force against Iran, to at least make clear it will support the president if he acts. Congress could augment Israel’s capacity to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities by passing legislation that would sell Israel 30,000-pound Massive Ordinance Penetrators (MOPs)—bunker-busters that can penetrate 200 feet below ground—as well as spare B-52s, currently unused by the U.S. Air Force, to deliver them. This would boost our leverage with Iran, send a strong signal of support for Israel, and improve the chances for a successful Israeli strike if that proves necessary.
Congress could do all these things, but all that they would succeed in doing is killing any chance of an agreement with Iran. Imposing new sanctions would sabotage the negotiations, and they would also undermine international support for existing sanctions, which rely in large part on Iran’s trading partners’ cooperation to have any meaningful effect. Iran’s trading partners in Asia and more than a few in Europe would be very pleased with a deal that would allow them to resume their normal business, but they would probably be just as glad to resume that business whether or not an agreement is reached. Additional U.S. sanctions would give them a perfect excuse to resume business as usual, which would make another round of U.S. sanctions as futile as it is foolish. Jim Antle points out this downside of imposing more sanctions in his article today:
A sanctions regime without strong international support may make Senate cosponsors feel good about themselves, but it won’t do much to influence Iranian behavior.
I doubt that Congress could bestir itself to pass an AUMF for Iran, since it seems so reluctant to pass an authorization for a war that the U.S. is already fighting, but it would be terrible if it did. Even if the Iranian government assumed that Obama would not act on such an authorization, the fact that it had been passed would be an additional and ongoing reason to distrust any offer the U.S. made. It would give Iran a pretext to abandon negotiations without incurring blame for their collapse. Worst of all, it would leave the door open to war with Iran at some point in the future. That would not only give Iran an excuse to walk away from negotiations, which would be bad enough, but it would give a future administration an opening to attack Iran at will. The threat by itself would probably be enough to strengthen the position of Iranian hard-liners to the detriment of all involved, and it would give those hard-liners another argument for acquiring a nuclear deterrent. Likewise, providing Israel with more weapons to create the impression that the U.S. wants to facilitate an Israeli attack would have much the same harmful effect on the prospects of a peaceful resolution of the issue. Each of these proposals would achieve nothing except to ratchet up tensions in the region and make a new armed conflict more likely, but then I assume that is why Iran hawks favor them.

The American Conservative,C,UVA’s Jackie: A Wahoo Tawana Brawley? | The American Conservative,"Magazine editor Richard Bradley, who was taken in by one of Stephen Glass’s hoax stories as an editor at another magazine, doesn’t buy the blockbuster Rolling Stone story out of the University of Virginia. Why did he buy the salacious “facts” in the Glass story?:
The answer, I had to admit, was because they corroborated my pre-existing biases. I was well on the way to believing that Vernon Jordan was a philanderer, for example—everyone seemed to think so, back in the ’90s.
So Stephen wrote what he knew I was inclined to believe. And because I was inclined to believe it, I abandoned my critical judgment. I lowered my guard.
The lesson I learned: One must be most critical, in the best sense of that word, about what one is already inclined to believe. So when, say, the Duke lacrosse scandal erupted, I applied that lesson. The story was so sensational! Believing it required indulging one’s biases: A southern school…rich white preppy boys…a privileged sports team…lower class African-American women…rape. It read like a Tom Wolfe novel.
And of course it never happened.
The story of Jackie, the UVA gang rape victim, strikes him as like this. How come? Here:
The first thing that strikes me about it, of course, is that Jackie is never identified. I don’t love that—it makes me uncomfortable to base an entire story on an unnamed source, and I can’t think of any other situation other than rape where a publication would allow that—but certainly one can see the rationale.
Then we have three friends who talked to Jackie right after the rape, and apparently discouraged her from going to the hospital or the authorities because they might subsequently be banned from frat parties. Not one of them is named, or interviewed; so the three people who could allegedly corroborate the assault don’t.
Then there’s the fact that Jackie apparently knew two of her rapists, but they are not named, nor does Rubin Erdley contact them, which is basically a cardinal rule of journalism: If someone in your story is accused of something, you’d better do your damnedest to give them a chance to respond. There’s no sign that Rubin Erdley did so. Why not? Did she not know their names? Would Jackie not tell her? Because if Rubin Erdley knew their names and didn’t call them, that is horrible journalism and undermines confidence in her reporting. And if she didn’t know their names—well, we’re back in Patrick Witt-land again.
Finally there’s the narrative of the gang rape itself. It is a terrible story—so terrible that, if it weren’t for the power of our preexisting biases, we would be hard-pressed to believe it.
Read the whole thing. There’s a lot more, and as someone who believed the Rolling Stone story, which spoke to my pre-existing biases about fraternities (the legacy of my GDI days at LSU), it makes me very queasy. Plus, the story does quote several women by name talking about their experiences with rape at UVA, and the UVA administration behaves in the story like a bureaucracy with something to hide (which doesn’t mean that it actually does have anything to hide).
The WaPo‘s Paul Farhi did a piece the other day on Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the journalist who wrote the piece. It’s mostly admiring, but:

Some elements of the story, however, are apparently too delicate for Erdely to talk about now. She won’t say, for example, whether she knows the names of Jackie’s alleged attackers or whether in her reporting she approached “Drew,” the alleged ringleader, for comment. She is bound to silence about those details, she said, by an agreement with Jackie, who “is very fearful of these men, in particular Drew. . . . She now considers herself an empty shell. So when it comes down to identifying them, she has a very hard time with that.”
The story does take one journalistic shortcut. The alleged assault, described in graphic detail, is presented largely without traditional qualifiers, such as “according to Jackie” or “allegedly.” The absence of such attribution or qualification leaves the impression that the events in question are undisputed facts, rather than accusations. Erdely said, however, that her writing style makes it clear that the events are being told from Jackie’s point of view.
In any case, there have been no outright denials from any party about the alleged crime Erdely reported, a rarity given the relative specificity of the allegations and the enormous impact of the story. A general statement on the matter came from Phi Kappa Psi’s Virginia chapter, which pledged its cooperation with a police investigation but said: “We have no specific knowledge of the claims” contained in the article.

Reason‘s Robby Soave takes it further: 
I have no reason to disbelieve Erdely, and I understand why she would choose not to disclose anyone’s identity. But she should be able to confirm that she knows who the attackers are, shouldn’t she? Again, we don’t have to know who they are, but we should know that she knows—or else the story is just one long uncorroborated accusation. And regardless of whether or not the story is told “from Jackie’s point of view,” it was written by Erdely, who treats its contents as fact.
And:
However, some of the details do strike me as perplexing on subsequent re-reads. One issue now being raised by skeptics is the nature of her injuries, which sound as if they would have required immediate medical attention. (According to the story, everybody involved was basically rolling around in broken glass for hours.) If the frat brothers were absolute sociopaths to do this to Jackie, her friends were almost cartoonishly evil—casually dismissing her battered and bloodied state and urging her not to go to the hospital.
Tonight, Farhi published an update on the WaPo website confirming that neither the reporter or her editors ever talked to any of the men accused of gang-raping Jackie. This is a big, big problem, journalistically. You can say, “They declined to comment for this article,” but you have to make a good-faith effort to reach them. It seems clear now that Sabrina Rubin Erdely failed to do this Journalism 101 step — and this failure was evident in the article, for those with eyes to see (this blog’s reader Ryan Booth, for one, questioned the article early on). This doesn’t mean that the story is false, of course, but it does make it much harder to believe.
If this turns out to be a hoax, UVA will have suffered a devastating loss of reputation — and Rolling Stone will need to lawyer up. Meanwhile, a writer for the feminist blog Jezebel calls Bradley and Soave names for daring to question the story — this, even though both men qualify their criticism by saying quite clearly that the story might well have gone down exactly as RS reports, but the reporter took some real liberties with her writing that warrant skepticism. By the way, Judith Shulevitz at the New Republic is also sounding skeptical. Jezebel’s scribe forgot to call her a self-hating woman who ought to shut her face. I’m sure they’ll get around to it.
UPDATE: I was thinking just now, reading the comments, why I shooed away the ordinary skeptical questions that came to mind when I read the story. I’m predisposed against liking fraternities, but I have never believed them to be rape mobs (though I think a group of young men and lots of booze are capable of most anything). For me, it was a matter of this Rolling Stone piece playing into a narrative that has come to have enormous emotional resonance within me: a story about a system that, when faced with evidence that the strong within it are preying sexually upon the weak, chooses to ignore or otherwise dismiss the gravity of the crimes, for the sake of protecting its own image. It’s pretty obvious why I am primed to believe these claims: because this is exactly what happened, again and again and again, with the Catholic Church. And yet, the familiarity of this narrative does not mean that when it is alleged — within the Church or other institutions, like UVA — that it actually happened. Here I am griping at the Ferguson partisans for believing that Mike Brown has to be Darren Wilson’s sacrificial lamb, despite the evidence (because it fit their preferred narrative about How Cops Treat Black People), but I was prepared to believe Jackie’s story on the basis of little real evidence offered because it fit my preferred narrative of How Institutions Treat Victims Who Have Been Sexually Assaulted By The Powerful. Damn. It seems that it’s not possible to learn the confirmation bias lesson often enough.

The American Conservative,C,Channing Tatum. Wrestling Picture. Whadaya Need – A Road Map? | The American Conservative,"“Foxcatcher,” the new film directed by Bennett Miller, is based on a true story. David and Mark Schultz really were gold-medal-winning American wrestlers at the 1984 Olympics. John du Pont really was the incredibly wealthy scion of the du Pont fortune, and he really did lure the Schultz brothers and other young wrestlers to his estate, Foxcatcher, to train for the 1988 Olympics. And (spoilers – lots of spoilers – stop reading if you hate spoilers) John DuPont really did end up murdering David.
But why did he end up killing him? What did the crime mean? What’s the story here, as opposed to what’s merely true?
The film, based on Mark’s book about his experiences, appears to make Mark the protagonist – it’s his story. When we first meet Mark, he’s living on the edge of poverty, even though he’s already won a gold medal, eating ramen for dinner and taking $20 speaking gigs at middle schools. He’s an angry, frustrated, impacted man, his rage at the world – and at his brother, who was also effectively his parent after their parents’ divorce – bursting out and then being shoved firmly back in.
His life changes when John du Pont enters the picture, inviting him to his mother’s horse farm, Foxcatcher, where he has built a state-of-the-art training facility for Mark and his fellow Olympic wrestlers. From the beginning, it’s clear that du Pont is a deeply odd duck, and it doesn’t take long for us to learn that he’s potentially quite dangerous – but it’s not at all clear that Mark understands this. He seems genuinely to buy in to the thoroughly unpersuasive line of bull about America and freedom and victory that du Pont is handing out, seems all-too-willing to call du Pont a mentor, even a father.
Channing Tatum, I have to say at this point, does an exceptional job of inhabiting this emotionally weak and pliable young hulk – the best work I’ve ever seen him do. I completely believed that Mark bought into du Pont, and that, once he figured out that du Pont was a problem, and was sucking him into a completely one-sided and destructive relationship rather than actually helping him to win, he couldn’t see how to escape it. The structural problem with the film, though, is that Mark never breaks out of that state of dependency.
Du Pont eventually turns on Mark, and offers David enough money to come up to Foxcatcher to be his de-jure assistant, de-facto head coach. Mark resents this, and acts out – until its clear that he can’t win on his own. Then his brother saves him from himself, and ultimately facilitates his escape from Foxcatcher and from du Pont, leveraging his importance to the operation to get a guaranteed income for Mark even after Mark leaves Foxcatcher and cuts ties with du Pont.
Mark, in other words, never achieves real independence, emotional or financial. He moves from dependence on his brother (the good mentor and father figure) to dependence on du Pont (the bad mentor and father figure) and back to dependence on his brother. And, from the final scene of the film, it looks like once his brother is dead, he descends into the lurid and degraded world of cage fighting – the final betrayal of his Olympian achievement.
I want to be clear: the problem is not that this is a downer. I love a good downer. The problem is that Mark’s failure to achieve independence means that the story doesn’t really have an arc, and that therefore I don’t know what his story means.
Why, after all, does Mark fall for du Pont? I don’t mean why does he take the gig – he desperately needs the money, and while the film could do a better job of making it clear why he’s so poor (to maintain his eligibility for the Olympics under then-extant rules, Mark had to remain an amateur, which meant not getting paid for any athletic activity), his financial need is manifest. But David has similar pecuniary reasons for compromise, and he never falls for du Pont for a second – he’s clear eyed about what he’s doing. Why does Mark fall for him?
One possibility is that Mark is responding to the fact that du Pont clearly has some kind of desire for him. Most of the chatter about the film has focused on du Pont’s sexuality, and the film can be powerfully critiqued for playing into lurid gay stereotypes. But, as Jordan Schildcrout points out, the real problem isn’t that du Pont embodies those stereotypes – maybe the real du Pont was like that – but that he doesn’t have much interiority, that the film doesn’t really let us know what it’s like to be him. But that, in turn, is only a fatal problem if this is du Pont’s movie. And it isn’t. It’s Mark’s. This isn’t “Gods and Monsters” in which the presumably-straight young hulk is just the observer, so we can be seduced by the fascinating older monster along with him. Mark is the point. What does he see in du Pont?
Well, what it looks like to me is that Mark is telling the truth when he says, in words du Pont put in his mouth, that he was looking for a father figure, and he finally found one. Du Pont is a pretty pathetic father figure, but he’s one Mark found on his own, and therefore one that can separate him from his brother. The film gestures toward the possibility that Mark is involved sexually with du Pont, but inasmuch as it gestures that way – having Mark frost the tips of his hair, having him wrestle with du Pont at night in the gym – it also suggests that Mark is humiliated by the relationship. The obvious, surface read for that is a homophobic one – Mark is humiliated that a man has a sexual interest in him. But I think a deeper way to read it is that there’s a kind of quasi-incestuous betrayal playing out in Mark’s mind as he realizes that his new father is a weak and emotionally hungry man who just wants to use him. It really doesn’t matter whether that “use” includes sex or not.
But that understanding makes it all the more imperative that Mark achieve some kind of independence. Instead, Mark is saved by his brother, and drifts out of the movie. Du Pont finally kills David – because David took away his surrogate son and love object, and because David refused to say anything nice about him on the hagiographic video he had produced about himself. David forced him to confront his own manifest impotence, and so he had to be killed. And, reading the ending back into earlier parts of the movie, David’s decision to stay with du Pont reads like a sacrifice of his own life to save his brother.
Now, consider how the film would read if, instead, Mark had killed du Pont. Mark is clearly jealous when his brother arrives. He’s angry at du Pont for saying that the team can’t succeed without David – that Mark’s not good enough. He’s furious at his brother seeing him in the degraded state to which he’s fallen (that’s clearly how he thinks of it). What if, later, when his brother tries to “save” him from the meal ticket that he, Mark, had found for all of them, that only heightened his impotent rage, ultimately leading him to kill du Pont.
That would have been a much more lurid film. It might have played even more problematically in terms of what it was saying about the psycho-sexual overtones of the relationship between Mark and du Pont. But it would have kept Mark at the center. The question would have remained: who is this man, and what will he do? And I think it would have been more narratively satisfying.
That’s not how it happened, of course. But then again, there are a lot of other things in the film that vary from “how it happened.”
For example: Steve Carrell’s du Pont is a fascinating and creepy creation, and totally real – petty, stupid, emotionally stunted, but real. One of my favorite things about his performance is the way in which he reveals du Pont’s human vulnerability at the same moment that he makes it all the more clear how deeply disturbed the character is. The scene on the helicopter, when du Pont takes cocaine and actually smiles as he plays with multi-syllable words; the scene after Mark has given him a haircut, and du Pont thanks him for being such a good friend, unlike his only childhood “friend” who his mother paid to play with him – forgetting, apparently, that exactly the same pecuniary relationship obtains with Mark. Those kinds of scenes.
What he doesn’t seem is obviously psychotic. Which the real du Pont apparently was:
John du Pont was insane.  There was no doubt about that, even early on.  I only met him a few times—he didn’t regularly attend training sessions—but even casual contact with John left me with an uneasy feeling. He had a bizarre look in his eyes that’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.  Even a chance encounter with John just left you with strange pangs of foreboding.
Stories about John’s strange behavior were legion.  He had a bad habit of driving inebriated around the estate and crashing into things.  On more than one occasion, he drove the car into a pond.  He also regularly carried a handgun with him and once, during his 50th birthday party, he inexplicably starting shooting off an AK-47.
By all accounts, in the months leading up to the shooting John’s behavior became even more bizarre. He kicked three African-American athletes off the farm, saying that Foxcatcher was run by the Ku Klux Klan and confronted one wrestler, Dan Chaid, by pointing an assault rifle at his chest.  The warning signs were there, but it was hard for anyone to admit it.
Why was it hard to admit it? Because all the wrestlers needed that meal ticket. There’s a story there to tell, a lurid parable of America in the 1980s, in which du Pont’s wealth lures the wrestling world up to his farm, where he prances about like a mad hatter with an AK-47 and everybody looks away because they need the money. And, again, “Foxcatcher” gestures toward that film – but the tone of that film is incompatible with the tone of the story of Mark and du Pont’s emotionally stunted folie à deux.
To see what I mean, consider the difference in tone between “Foxcatcher” and what is probably the emblematic 1980s movie about money. Like Mark, the Charlie Sheen character Bud Fox in “Wall Street,” – which came out in 1987, the year in which “Foxcatcher” is set – is torn between two mentors and father figures: the good one (Fox’s actual father, a union leader at an airline), and the bad one (Gordon Gekko). But there the comparisons end. Gekko stands for something; he’s an attractive anti-heroic figure. Fox is a young man of promise. We’re seduced along with him – because Gekko is the true spirit of the age. Du Pont, by contrast, is repellent from the moment we meet him. There is nothing – nothing – attractive about this man. He’s obviously weak, creepy, stupid and dangerous.
If we read the film is a kind of parable of the malign 1%, with Mark as America, then it’s a pretty damning comment on America that we were ever seduced by the Reaganite myth. I mean, who but an emotionally weak and vulnerable idiot would ever be genuinely seduced by the likes of John du Pont? On that level, I “get” the movie, but it feels weirdly displaced in time – a parable of the Great Recession pasted onto the era of “greed is good.”
By contrast, consider how the film would play out if David were the main character. Mark Ruffalo plays David as a conscientious and fundamentally giving person, without ever making him seem like a goody-goody or somebody without guts in his belly. He’s both a good man and a real man. It makes sense that Mark could get sucked into du Pont’s orbit, and couldn’t figure out how to escape. What does it mean that David was willing, for the right price, to take his place?
Now we’ve got a story to tell – a story in which David thinks he’s protecting his brother, thinks he’s promoting the sport of wrestling, thinks he’s doing all the right things. Du Pont can be a monster – he can even be the creepy monster of this film, and not somebody seductive at all. Maybe that very manifest weakness and stupidity is why David, representing the best of America, thinks he can handle the monster of gruesome wealth, accept its suzerainty for the sake of the good it can do. And then the monster kills him.
But that’s David’s story. Not Mark’s.
This has been a difficult write-up for me, because I really like stories in which each character has weight, in which we can even be confused about who exactly is the protagonist. One of the scripts I wrote, the one I’m probably most attached to, works that way a bit – though there is a main character, I try to give you the perspective of each of the major characters, see the whole film from the inside as each of them would. Many of Chekhov’s plays are like that – is there really a single protagonist of The Cherry Orchard or The Three Sisters or Uncle Vanya? I don’t think so.
I’m just not sure this is that kind of story. There’s a powerful story hidden in this film, about fatherlessness and emotional dependence, about the corruptions of wealth – particularly hereditary wealth – and the impossible demands of American masculinity. And  Tatum, Carrell and Ruffalo all give gripping and nuanced performances – plenty strong enough to keep me in the film. I’m unequivocally glad I saw it – would be happy to see it again.
I just worry that the truth got in the way of the story.

The American Conservative,C,Europe’s Conchita Wurst Consensus | The American Conservative,"When the 2014 pan-European Eurovision song contest was won by an Austrian singer doing a drag queen act under the stage name Conchita Wurst, Western media hailed the victory as signaling a new era of tolerance in Europe. No better symbol was needed for the success of liberal democracy in the old continent; Brussels especially was ecstatic, and the European Parliament quickly extended an invitation to Wurst to perform on its premises.
Eurovision is an old event that seeks to promote European unity through entertainment, but the show often instead gives evidence of continued differences and regional conflicts. Viewers phone in to vote on who should receive their country’s points. Old dividing lines often emerge when Greeks don’t vote for Turkish contestants, Armenians for Azeris, Russians for Ukrainians, etc.
Reveling in their progressive pride, many may have missed the interesting fact that of all the states that awarded points to Austria’s Conchita Wurst, only one, Slovenia, was Slavic. For that matter, Slovenia once belonged to the Austrian Empire and the two countries maintain close ties, which might explain the neighborly support. Conversely, the other six Slavic states were apparently not impressed by the culturally innovative Austria. Indeed, not one former Warsaw Pact country cast its votes for Wurst, nor did Muslim Albania or staunchly Catholic Malta.
One of the unspoken truths of the EU’s successive enlargements to the East is precisely the dissimilar cultural values of the new entrants. Many of the new member-states actually vote for MEPs who end up joining the ranks of Eurosceptic parties in the European Parliament. Gay pride parades have met numerous difficulties in the new members’ societies, and in 2013, one of the most liberal societies of the Western Balkans—and the latest member of the EU—Croatia, actually voted to ban gay marriage. The same is the case with such current applicants for accession as Serbia or Turkey. Turkey’s AKP party governments have dialed back the conquests of Ataturk’s secularism; Serbia is even more socially conservative than Croatia.
The EU speaks of its “power of attraction” in the region, an attraction allegedly inspired by shared and universal values. One might recall the EU flags in the background of Mikhail Saakashvili’s office during his 2008 wartime broadcasts pleading with the West for help, or more recently those waved during the “Euromaidan” revolution in Ukraine. Yet while both Georgia and Ukraine wish to join the EU and NATO, even the EU’s current eastern members pale in comparison to Tbilisi and Kiev when it comes to homophobia and intolerance. In truth, many of the activists in Georgia and Ukraine promoting the European path are themselves not the most liberal minded people—even excluding the ultra-nationalists.
So why do they so desperately see their future in Europe? What drives a nation like Serbia to bend over backwards to ingratiate itself with institutions and countries that were just a few years ago its tormentors and enemies, risking even its historical claim—a claim backed by an insurmountable pile of international law—to Kosovo? Western polling on the matter clearly reveals that societies in Central and Eastern Europe consistently choose the Brussels and Washington path over Moscow’s socially conservative message.
The Western narrative is confident that the younger generation, the one organizing the gay pride parades, risking their lives in exposing corruption, serving as the cannon fodder for the dogs and brutal paramilitary forces of authoritarian regimes in the region, will turn around the backward mentality of the region’s masses.
There are also large numbers of the new generation that are swayed by less liberal ideas, however. In Russia for example, the Kremlin has cultivated young nationalist initiatives, and the appearance of neo-Nazis and other radicals throughout the region, is certainly not a phenomenon driven by the elderly.
The most important difference between radicals and liberals is that liberals have the political and financial support of the West, and radicals do not. Liberals can promise investment as well as access to a larger export market, radicals—especially autarkic ones—cannot.
Through academia, the NGO sector, and industrial delocalization, the Western imprint on these societies exerts an important form of soft power. American and European funding of exchange programs, activism, or simple foreign direct investment, has, since 1989, artificially swelled the critical mass of liberals in these societies. It is in fact impressive to observe the disproportionate number of young adults who in their respective capital cities, professionally depend, directly or indirectly, on some form of Western development aid—and this counts double for territories under international protectorate such as Kosovo or Bosnia-Herzegovina.
When highly individualistic liberal westerners looked at the velvet revolutions behind the Iron Curtain, they saw themselves. If the French had rid themselves of absolutist monarchs, the British from authoritarian republicans, and the Nordics from Nazi occupation, then it stood to reason that overthrowing despotic communist regimes was also a path towards a liberal society; this perception held even when some movements were clearly inspired by religious tradition, others by simple economic misery, and all by nationalism.
One of the easy critiques emanating from Moscow these days is that some activists fighting for the new regime in Kiev are neo-Nazis and ultranationalists. While this is true, it also reveals the nature of the alliance between Eastern Europeans and the West: for the former, such an alliance is purely instrumental, serving the purpose of eliciting Western aid to the common anti-Russia cause.
The scholar Stathis Kalyvas describes the utter parochialism of societies different from the West and the purely tactical role played by ideologies in procuring external power assistance for purposes of domestic power conquest. In his words, “local cleavages are typically articulated in the language of the war’s master cleavage, often instrumentally”
This is precisely what happens in the border between Europe and Asia and why high-minded policies invariably end up propping the weaker party against adverse odds. Furthermore, the phenomenon is not new.
By the time the 1848 revolutions had arrived in far-eastern Europe, totalitarian ideologies had taken over Western Europe. Thus, many of the local ethnic irredentist leaders that sided with the invading Nazi armies did so only nominally. From the shores of the Black Sea to those of the Baltic, the social consensus for liberation impelled the native populations to welcome the Wehrmacht as liberators, and to seek to shine a “modern” national-socialist light on their more primitive desire for ethnic emancipation and Russophobe resistance; hence the Eastern European “Spring of the Peoples” came into a bad reputation.
Similarly, the “multi-national missions” or the “international community responses” carried out today, are embedded in paradoxical strategic interests and serve, often, almost completely symbolic purposes.
Estonian troops are not mobilized to the Central African Republic because they bring unique assets or competencies, any more than Ukrainian and Georgian troops did in Iraq. And it is difficult to discern how soldiers trained for harsh winter conditions in a Slavic area would be of particular use in desert and tropical environments in Africa or the Middle East.
Their true agenda is rather to further add to the rhetorical entrapment of the West: if “solidarity” and “world order” demand international contributions, so too one day such contributions will be required to protect “New Europe” from the likes of Russia.
This is the nature of the Conchita Wurst Consensus. It is an exchange between dissimilar cultures that results in a superficial political compromise. During the communist era, Socialist Bloc citizens had a saying, “they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work.” Perhaps today it should go, “they pretend to protect us and we pretend to admire them.”

The American Conservative,C,"Double Feature Feature: 10,000 Hours Edition | The American Conservative","“Whiplash,” the new film from writer/director Damien Chazelle, will surely earn J. K. Simmons his first Oscar nomination, and may be a contender for other nominations as well. It’s an engrossing story about a folie a deux between two strong-willed artistic personalities, and the overpowering drive for greatness. It’s simple, it’s got a powerful drive, and it’s got a very direct and overwhelming performance. The Academy will eat it up.
It’s also got a hollowness at its core, which I don’t think will hurt it one bit. It didn’t hurt another film that got the Academy’s attention a few years back, also about an artist consumed with ambition. That film, Darren Aronofsky’s “Black Swan,” won Natalie Portman an Oscar for her performance as a driven young ballerina. On the surface, the contrasts with “Whiplash” are more notable than the similarities – to begin with, Aronofsky’s film is far bigger, more visually inventive, more overtly expressionist in its method, while Chazelle’s is a classic small-scale “indie” film – but I think they have something essential in common that is worth picking at like a scab on our culture’s soul. To whit: an unwillingness – or inability – to wrestle something far more elusive than artistic ambition: the true nature of artistic genius.
Chazelle’s film follows Andrew (Miles Teller), a drummer at a prestigious music school called Schaffer Academy (a thinly-disguised Juilliard). Andrew is determined to become one of the great jazz drummers in history, and the surest ticket to that destiny (as he sees it) is to earn a spot in the studio band run by the famously abusive Mr. Fletcher (played with great gusto by Mr. Simmons). Nobody else sees anything much in Andrew – his father is at best perplexed by his ambition to be a great drummer, and the rest of his family is downright hostile (and Andrew returns that hostility tenfold). But Fletcher sees something in Andrew, and asks him to join his band when Andrew is still a freshman. Thus begins a classic sado-masochistic mentor-mentee relationship, Fletcher alternating between building Andrew up and ruthlessly cutting him down, including humiliating him in front of his fellow musicians, repeated physical assault, and a host of twisted mind games.
Andrew buys in completely to Fletcher’s theory of greatness, according to which the best way to produce great artists is to demand the impossible of them, and to abuse them mercilessly when fail to deliver, the better to motivate them to try harder. “There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ‘good job,’ ” Fletcher says, and Andrew smiles in agreement.
It’s worth noting that while their meeting of the minds happens very quickly, this particular exchange takes place after quite a bit of plot has washed under the bridge. Andrew has, by this point in the film, already been through several cycles of favor and disfavor complete with tongue-lashings and flung furniture; has already demonstrated the insanity of his commitment by demanding to play the drums in competition immediately after crawling bloody from a car he has just totaled in a horrific accident; and, most important, has already turned on his former mentor in retaliation for his most-recent rejection, resulting in his mentor losing his job. Andrew believed in Fletcher’s philosophy before Fletcher ever arrived on the scene, and he still believes in it after he’s formally rejected him. And sure enough, the film builds to a climax and conclusion that appears to validate Fletcher’s philosophy completely.
Fletcher thinks of himself as a counter-cultural figure, railing against the prevailing acceptance of mediocrity, but he’s just representing another strain in our culture: the ”Tiger Mother,” vigorously applying the spur of negative motivation to ultimate achievement. His notion of where greatness comes from is very Malcolm Gladwell; you practice for 10,000 hours, and you at least have a chance. And his currency is external recognition: winning the competition, impressing the audience, getting a job. This is not counter-cultural; if anything, what’s notable about “Whiplash” is how unaware it is of the achievement focus of our culture generally. It’s as is nobody in Andrew’s world had seen “The Hunger Games” or “Divergent” or “Ender’s Game” or any other piece of contemporary adolescent dystopia pitting children against each other in a brutal contest contrived by adults. Had they done so, they might have recognized Fletcher as a type.
The thing is, it’s not obvious that most of Fletcher’s abuse has anything to do with promoting outstanding musicianship, as opposed to promoting a twisted emotional dependence on his personal favor. Fletcher doesn’t do any instruction. He doesn’t teach. Moreover, there’s no sense that there are particular qualities of play to be cultivated; Fletcher is all about accuracy, being on tempo and on pitch. Now, these things are incredibly important, especially for a drummer, but while good musicianship definitely requires these things, it’s also about feel – indeed, without feel, all the accuracy in the world won’t get you anywhere near greatness. But feel is something Fletcher seems to have no interest in. And neither does Andrew – his own practice seems focused, overwhelmingly, on going faster, faster, faster.

“Black Swan” would seem to start in a similar place when it comes to the question of what makes great art, but to end somewhere different. Its heroine, Nina Sayers (Ms. Portman), is the same kind of driven personality, determined to be great. She’s devoted her entire life to this ambition, spurred on by her former-dancer mother (a deliciously over-the-top Barbara Hershey), and to the exclusion of any kind of social or romantic life. As with “Whiplash,” the story turns on an unexpected opportunity to move up the ladder – in Sayers’s case, to play the lead in a production of Swan Lake. And there’s a mentor, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), who isn’t above playing some mind games, particularly pitting her against another rising ballerina, Lily (Mila Kunis).
Leroy’s main objective, though, isn’t to push Sayers to her physical and mental limit – she’s already doing that to herself – but to open her up to a more ecstatic dimension of experience; to find her dark and passionate side so that she can actually play the Black Swan as well as the White. It seems that practice, discipline, and ascetic athleticism aren’t enough. You have to live. You have to feel.
There’s an obviously erotic dimension to this emotional opening-up, but Sayers ultimately finds her dark passion not in that erotic awakening but in finally giving full rein to the violence of her ambition, and killing her rival – at least in her mind; much of the pleasure of Aronofsky’s film lies in the distinctive way in which he blurs the line between reality and fantasy, and the visceral impact of his own imagination (particularly as it relates to the horror of corporeality itself). In any event, when she finally lets go, she is able to dance the role with the required abandon – but at the price of her own destruction.
That sounds like almost the opposite of where Chazelle’s film goes – but under the surface, they share something deeper in common, and that is a fundamental lack of interest in the experience of creating art, the reduction of that experience to achievement, to passing some kind of test. We never really understand why Sayers wants to be a dancer, or what she gets out of dancing, beyond achieving what her mother never did. We don’t ever really understand why Andrew wants to be a drummer, or what he gets out of drumming, beyond wanting to prove to his uncomprehending family that he is great. The thing itself – the dance, the music – isn’t really in view.
Unlike Chazelle’s, Aronofsky’s film is aware that his heroine is missing something – but it’s the wrong something. It’s not sex, or the love of the body, that Sayers is missing. It’s a love of the dance. And the film – which is so visually striking that you know Aronofsky is in love with his own medium of film – is missing it, too. You don’t come away from “Black Swan” with any feeling for dance.
*     *     *
Artistic genius is an elusive thing. Romantics tend to think of it as something innate, that only needs to be let out. And there is an element of the innate, most often; the great painters, writers, musicians, etc. – most of them started out with a gift. But not all of them, and not all to the same degree. Cézanne was not Picasso. Beethoven was not Mozart. Some truly great artists are more labored, and you can tell, while others make it look effortless.
What they have in common, though, is a fierce attachment, a love, of the activity itself, not for the sake of recognition, not as an index of personal achievement, but for the sake of the thing itself and what is being done. And that’s even true of drummers, those work-horses of the music world who one too often thinks of as only serving as a kind of background for the “real” musicians.
For my proof text, I’ll offer the documentary, “Beware of Mr. Baker.” Much of the film is devoted to Ginger Baker’s chaotic life and apparently unscratchable itch for personal conflict. But much of it is about the music, the one thing that Ginger Baker loved unequivocally and passionately in a life otherwise marked by a great deal of anger, spite and outright misanthropy.
I came out of that film energized, filled with a ludicrous desire to be as good as Ginger Baker at, well, at anything. Not because I wanted to prove something to an uncomprehending father or an over-controlling mother, but because I could hear, I could feel, what he was doing – and I could see, on his face, that he could feel it, too. That feeling looked like something worth having, worth more than many more comfortable things in life. Certainly more than praise from the teacher.
That’s the feeling I never got looking at the face of Miles Teller – or the face of Natalie Portman. That’s what they have in common, and it is the saddest thing about both films.

The American Conservative,C,What Are “National Rights”? | The American Conservative,"I’m puzzled by the so-called “Jewish State” bill currently in the process of making its way into Israeli law.
Not by the politics of the law – that I understand. The law is a classic “wedge” issue, a symbolic way of spitting in the eyes of one’s opponents. It’s disgraceful, but it’s not exactly uncommon in politics. All the right people – that is to say, the left people – will be outraged, and in their outrage will say things that convince all the right people – that is to say, the people on the right – that they had better vote for “patriotic” parties in the upcoming election.
But would the bill actually do anything?
The original context in which the law was drawn up would be comical were it not so pathetic. The Israeli government demands that, as part of any peace agreement, the Palestinian side recognize Israel as a Jewish State, something the Palestinian side has always explicitly refused to do. When the bill was originally conceived, the notion was that, if Israel were defined in law as a Jewish State, then recognizing Israel would by definition be recognizing its Jewish “character” – and surely the Palestinians would not withdraw their recognition of Israel as such. Thus: de-facto recognition of Israel as a Jewish State would be accomplished.
This was a ludicrous rationale for a law on its face, because it was obviously not going to work. You can’t premise success in negotiating a peace agreement on the idea of tricking the other side into agreeing to something that they don’t actually support, or on the idea of tricking your own camp into believing their objectives have been met. This really is playground-appropriate stuff.
But Benjamin Netanyahu, in defending the bill, argued that there was a substantive purpose as well: preserving the “national rights” of the Jewish nation without, as he saw it, contravening the precepts of democracy:
The state of Israel is a Jewish and a democratic state. These two values are intertwined, and one does not outweigh the other. We promise equal rights for everyone, regardless of religion, race or sex. At the same time, Israel is the nation-state of the Jews only. This combination between the the rights of the nation and the rights of the individual, serves as the central thread in all of Israel’s founding documents.”
What are those “rights of the nation” that Netanyahu refers to? As examples, Netanyahu cited “a flag, anthem, the right of every Jew to immigrate to Israel and other national symbols.”
Here’s what I find puzzling about this. Suppose that there were a proposal to change the Israeli flag to something less-identified with the Jewish people – say, one of those tricolors the Europeans are so mad for. What would the consequence of the Jewish State law be for such a proposal? Would it be inadmissible for consideration in the Knesset? Would only Jewish MKs be allowed to vote on it? How would the “Jewish nation” exercise its national “rights” on this question?
Obviously, these kinds of prohibitions would be transparently undemocratic. But if nothing of the sort is contemplated, what, exactly, is being codified here, other than a reaffirmation of the status quo?
Well, we should be clear about what the status quo means – within the Green Line, not in the territories. It means that Arab citizens can be discriminated against in housing, including state-supported efforts to move Jewish citizens into Arab-dominated regions coupled with local discrimination to keep Arab citizens out of Jewish areas. That they can be discriminated against in education – most Arab citizens are educated in a separate school system from Jewish Israelis (actually, there are three official “streams” in Israeli education, secular state schools, Jewish religious state schools, and Arab schools, plus a large set of ultra-Orthodox Jewish religious schools that are outside state control but receive state support, plus a small smattering of independent schools, but now I’ve probably given too much information). And so forth.
That status quo has substantial majority support among Jewish Israelis. But it does not have overwhelming support among the judiciary. The High Court recently upheld the current law that permits discrimination against Arab applicants in housing in small communities, but did so on a narrow majority on largely procedural grounds. There’s every reason to believe that, even as the country moves right, the judiciary might increasingly flex its muscles against that majority’s efforts to criminalize dissent and sanction invidious discrimination.
This, in my view, is the most tangible practical significance of the Jewish State bill: that it would provide a legal justification for upholding the legitimacy of the discriminatory aspects of the status quo when faced with legal challenge.
The Law of Return, after all, already exists, as does the Chief Rabbinate, the national anthem, the flag, and so forth. None of these are expressions of liberal ideals, but none of them exceptional among nations either – other countries have flags and anthems that reflect or come to embody a national character, established religions are hardly unheard of (particularly in Israel’s region), and even the idea of immigration preference for the dominant ethnic group is common among countries with a large co-ethnic diaspora. There’s no plausible purpose to a law that merely reiterates these things that are already established, and no way that passing such a law would secure them against a popular majority that actually wanted to change them – and meanwhile a majority of Israeli citizens is moving rapidly in the other direction politically-speaking, so such a liberal majority is not exactly in the offing. The only practical threat to existing arrangements comes from the courts. So that’s where I locate the practical import of the law.
The more pressing practical question of identity that Israel needs to deal with, as I’ve been saying for years, is whether to grant national minority rights to its Arab sector, which would imply a higher degree of autonomy in questions of land use and so forth. If Israel really does want to remain a Jewish national state while also moving towards something resembling fair treatment of its Arab minority, that would seem to be the direction to go.
Meanwhile: if Netanyahu is really determined to place the question of the Jewish character of the state beyond the reach of democratic politics, I modestly propose that he go all the way, and thereby remove all doubt about where the country is headed.

About Us


The American Conservative is published by the American Ideas Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, 501(c)(3) organization whose mission is to educate and inform Americans about the need for fiscal responsibility, a prudent foreign policy, and the protection of civil liberties.
In both domestic and foreign affairs, The American Conservative promotes a conservatism of realism and reform. A conservatism of ideas over ideology, and principles over party. In an age of trillion-dollar deficits, crumbling communities, and endless wars and rumors of war, we can no longer allow American public life to be guided by fantasies. The realist knows what Edmund Burke knew: that while revolution is terrifyingly destructive, reform is always necessary, for it is the means of our preservation.
The American Conservative represents a new voice for a new generation of conservatives. We invest in creative thinking about serious challenges facing the United States, from how to rebuild the middle class to how to reconceptualize America’s role in the world, and we are having an impact. The conversation is changing, and our readership is at an all-time high. These readers are people like you, willing to engage in the ideas that will guide our nation’s future.
You can be a part of this effort by joining the American Ideas Institute today! Together we’ll reshape the Right, and move the political debate in more hopeful directions.

The American Conservative,C,Grand Strategy Is Bunk | The American Conservative,"Since the 1990s, the teaching and advocacy of “grand strategy” has become something of a cottage industry. Degree programs and courses are on offer at Duke, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the City University of New York, Temple University, Columbia University, Bard College, MIT, Georgetown, and Johns Hopkins’ School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). The country’s leading grand-strategy program, Yale University’s, is supported by a $17.5 million endowment and has received generous backing from the legendary financier Roger M. Hertog.
Yale’s program is apparently so well-heeled that in recent years it has been able to recruit such luminaries as retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, Henry Kissinger, and New York Times columnist David Brooks to hold forth on the wisdom and rightness of America’s foreign-policy master plans.
In his unimaginatively titled 2010 book, Grand Strategies, Yale’s Charles Hill, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz, sought to subordinate the Western literary canon to the service of an interpretive history of interstate politics. The phenomenon of intellectuals who deploy higher (artistic) means to serve base (political) ends is not a new one. As the Soviet dissident Andrei Sinyavsky noted, “Soviet literature of the twenties and thirties reveals an odd and unusual friendship between writers and Chekists.”
That aside, grand strategy has a pedigree that reaches as far back as the fin de siècle—around the time, not coincidentally, that America emerged as a world power in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War of 1898. That year, while visiting his friend John Hay—soon to be secretary of state—Henry Adams recalled in his characteristic third-person prose: “listening to any member of the British Cabinet, for all were alike now, discuss the Philippines as a question of balance of power in the East he could see that the family work of a hundred and fifty years fell at once into the grand perspective of true empire-building.”
Was this the first insider account of the nascent art of Anglo-American grand strategizing? Perhaps. But Henry Adams was too wise to give it overmuch thought. The grand-strategy enthusiast in the family was his younger brother, Brooks. In 1900, Brooks Adams released his book America’s Economic Supremacy in eager anticipation of the time—soon, in his telling—when the British would be obliged to pass the torch of world leadership to their former colonial subjects. According to Brooks, in bumptious Teddy Roosevelt-like prose very much the opposite of his older brother’s, “America must fight her own battles whether she wills or no. From the inexorable decree of destiny she cannot escape. … All signs point to the approaching supremacy of the United States.”
And so from the very start there has been an almost teleological aspect to American grand strategy, that “inexorable decree of destiny.” But if Adams’s thinking showed signs of historical (and possibly divine) determinism, the grand strategy of Britain’s Alfred Mackinder was indicative of a mind held captive by the idea that geography is destiny. His 1904 essay “The Geographical Pivot of History” put forward the proposition—which would in some ways be echoed by V.I. Lenin’s Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism in 1917—that access to colonial markets was crucial to the health of the state, and imperial competition would lessen the chances of major class conflict at home. The fight over foreign markets would inevitably, in this telling, lead to interstate conflict.
In 1919, Mackinder published Democratic Ideals and Reality, in which he put forward his famous axiom that “He who rules East Europe commands the Heartland: Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island: Who rules the World-Island commands the World.” In a sense, Mackinder’s ideas on the strategic primacy of Eastern Europe and the danger of Russian hegemony over Eurasia are similar to those that guide our newest generation of American Cold Warriors today.
While Mackinder stressed the primacy of land power and preventing Russia from gaining the great inland fortress of the “World-Island,” American grand strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan stressed the importance of maintaining military superiority upon the seas. In numerous books such as The Influence of Sea Power Upon the French Revolution and Empire, 1783-1812, Mahan put forward the notion that an army could be forced into submission through the application of a naval blockade, which he called “the most striking and awful mark of sea power.”
By the late 1930s the forerunner to today’s grand-strategy courses was taking shape. According to the sociologist John Bellamy Foster, in 1939 the State Department joined forces with the Council on Foreign Relations to form a War and Peace Studies program, with the help of a generous grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The program focused on a geographic region called the “Grand Area,” which according to Foster was seen to “constitute an informal empire, modeled after U.S. domination of Latin America, involving the free flow of capital, under the economic, political, and military hegemony of the United States.”
But it was after World War II, in 1947, that grand strategy really caught the imagination of American policymakers. That year George F. Kennan, elaborating upon the ideas of Mackinder and the political scientist Nicholas John Spykman, laid out the first draft of what would become America’s strategy of containment vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. It was with his “Long Telegram” that the concept of American grand strategy made its way from the academic periphery to becoming a central tenet in the Washington establishment’s conception of world leadership.
The results, by and large, have been abysmal. Kennan, realizing what he had wrought, spent the remainder of his long career trying in vain to undo the forces his dispatch helped unleash. After the containment strategy was enshrined as official policy by the NSC-68 report during the Truman administration, successive presidents would attempt to elaborate on the original directive by issuing addendums—commonly and pretentiously referred to as presidential “doctrines”—of one kind or another. These doctrines, particularly those promulgated during the last 40 years, reveal the shortcomings of grand strategy.
The Carter Doctrine, for instance, declared that the Persian Gulf was now a “vital interest of the United States of America” and that any attempt by an outside power to gain control of the region would “be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.” Thus began the country’s four-decade (and counting) commitment to the security of some the planet’s most noxious regimes. The Reagan Doctrine made even less strategic sense, pledging support for anti-communist insurgents wherever they might be, in places of such intrinsic strategic value as Nicaragua and Afghanistan. The fruits of this policy hardly need to be elaborated. 
George H.W. Bush’s administration gave rise to a grand strategy that went on to serve as the template for American foreign policy until the Obama administration. The assumptions that underlie Bush the First’s “Defense Planning Guidance” of 1992 differ very little from those which animated the grand strategy put forward a decade later by George W. Bush. “The National Security Strategy of the United States” in 2002 stated, among other things, that the U.S. would act to preclude the emergence of a peer military competitor anywhere in the world.
Now consider: each one of these iterations of presidential grand strategy has resulted in an unarguable diminution of American power, prestige, and treasure. And while it is entirely possible that the strategies themselves were to blame, I suspect the true culprit is the concept. From the beginning, efforts to formulate a grand strategy have too often served to exacerbate an American tendency that some of our more thoughtful statesmen have been only too happy to discourage: a binary view of the world born of a sincerely held belief in the myth of our collective national innocence.
What rankles our modern-day grand strategists about President Obama is partly that he has failed to enunciate an Obama Doctrine. Yet worse, in their eyes, is that his hesitancy seems to be an implicit rejection of the claims of American exceptionalism—which, from the time of Brooks Adams onward, has been an integral assumption of American grand strategy.

The American Conservative,C,A Fraternity of Rape | The American Conservative,"UVA may be to fraternities what Boston was to the Catholic Church @CaitlinPacific
— W Bradford Wilcox (@WilcoxNMP) November 23, 2014
Brad Wilcox, by the way, is a sociologist who teaches at the University of Virginia. I had heard nothing of the UVA rape scandal until he linked via his Twitter feed to Rolling Stone‘s blockbuster exposé of the rape culture among the school’s fraternities. Please read this, especially if you have sons or daughters in college, or who will be in college one day.
It begins with a first-year female student named Jackie, invited upstairs by her date, a fraternity brother in Phi Kappa Psi, one of the oldest and most prestigious male Greek organizations on the UVA campus. Here is a serenade from that national fraternity’s songbook (the men in the accompanying video are not from the UVA chapter, as far as I can tell):
For she is the sweetheart of Phi Kappa Psi,
The girl of all girls most dear;
Hers is the love that will never, never die,
Thru the fortunes and sorrows that come with the years.
Her eyes speak of promise, most tender and true,
Of happiness soon to be,
For there’s coming a day
When each Phi Psi sails away
With his sweetheart in Phi Kappa Psi.
Yeah. So, Jackie was led into a gang-rape ambush. Rolling Stone reports:
She remembers every moment of the next three hours of agony, during which, she says, seven men took turns raping her, while two more – her date, Drew, and another man – gave instruction and encouragement. She remembers how the spectators swigged beers, and how they called each other nicknames like Armpit and Blanket. She remembers the men’s heft and their sour reek of alcohol mixed with the pungency of marijuana. Most of all, Jackie remembers the pain and the pounding that went on and on.
And then, after she escaped:
Minutes later, her three best friends on campus – two boys and a girl (whose names are changed) – arrived to find Jackie on a nearby street corner, shaking. “What did they do to you? What did they make you do?” Jackie recalls her friend Randall demanding. Jackie shook her head and began to cry. The group looked at one another in a panic. They all knew about Jackie’s date; the Phi Kappa Psi house loomed behind them. “We have to get her to the hospital,” Randall said.
Their other two friends, however, weren’t convinced. “Is that such a good idea?” she recalls Cindy asking. “Her reputation will be shot for the next four years.” Andy seconded the opinion, adding that since he and Randall both planned to rush fraternities, they ought to think this through. The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie’s rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep. Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: “She’s gonna be the girl who cried ‘rape,’ and we’ll never be allowed into any frat party again.”
The Rolling Stone story reveals a campus culture in which fraternity houses are widely known as places where girls, especially freshman girls (who are too young to get into bars) are invited inside, gotten drunk, and bedded. The story says most of the sex is consensual, but sexual predators flourish among the general culture of booze and sex within the frat houses. Here’s the most appalling thing about the UVA story: the college’s administration and many of its alumni defend this culture, either passively or actively.
Throughout the story, you read over and over that the UVA administration refused to make anyone available to answer the reporter’s completely legitimate queries about what happened to Jackie and other women at the school. Get this: when Jackie went to the dean in charge of handling sexual assault claims (a woman, incidentally), she gave Jackie the choice of calling the cops or letting the university handle it:
Like many schools, UVA has taken to emphasizing that in matters of sexual assault, it caters to victim choice. “If students feel that we are forcing them into a criminal or disciplinary process that they don’t want to be part of, frankly, we’d be concerned that we would get fewer reports,” says associate VP for student affairs Susan Davis. Which in theory makes sense: Being forced into an unwanted choice is a sensitive point for the victims. But in practice, that utter lack of guidance can be counterproductive to a 19-year-old so traumatized as Jackie was that she was contemplating suicide. Setting aside for a moment the absurdity of a school offering to handle the investigation and adjudication of a felony sex crime – something Title IX requires, but which no university on Earth is equipped to do – the sheer menu of choices, paired with the reassurance that any choice is the right one, often has the end result of coddling the victim into doing nothing.
This is what the Catholic Church did. The first case I wrote about, back in 2001, involved an immigrant teenager who was passed around priests in a Bronx parish. When the boy’s father learned what happened, he went to see an auxiliary bishop. According to the victim’s lawyer, the auxiliary bishop allegedly pulled out a checkbook and offered a payout in exchange for the father signing a paper giving the Archdiocese of New York’s attorneys the right to handle his case. The father may have been a laborer and an immigrant, but he knew a scam when he saw it. He left and hired his own lawyer.
And here we see the University of Virginia following a similar script. The deeper you read into the story, the more clear it is that the University of Virginia’s administration has been absolutely and disgustingly derelict for decades, protecting the reputation of the institution at all costs. Excerpt:
If Seccuro’s story of administrative cover-up and apathy sounds outrageous, it’s actually in keeping with the stories told by other UVA survivors. After one alumna was abducted from a dark, wooded section of campus and raped in 1993, she says she asked a UVA administrator for better lighting. “They told me it would ruin Jefferson’s vision of what the university was supposed to look like,” the alum says. “As if Thomas Jefferson even knew about electric lights!” In 2002 and 2004, two female students, including Susan Russell’s daughter, were unhappy with their sexual-misconduct hearings, which each felt didn’t hold their alleged perpetrators accountable – and each was admonished by UVA administrators to never speak publicly about the proceedings or else they could face expulsion for violating the honor code. For issuing that directive, in 2008 UVA was found in violation of the Clery Act.
Please do read the entire Rolling Stone article.  It is no more credible to believe that this phenomenon is isolated to the University of Virginia than it is to believe that clerical sexual abuse was limited to the Archdiocese of Boston. I hope Brad Wilcox is right, and this sparks a nationwide series of newspaper investigations into fraternity rapes and the responses of universities.
By the way, the University of Virginia was finally shamed into action by the RS piece. UVA’s president Teresa Sullivan has temporarily suspended all fraternity activity on campus.  You’ll note in the RS story that many of these UVA administrators are women.
I don’t understand the attraction of college Greek life. I will strongly discourage my children — not just my daughter, but my sons — from getting involved with it in any way. Too rapey. I do not want my kids, as college students, to be subject to rape, to participate in rape, or to be in a position in which they are pressured to prove their loyalty to their fraternity, their friends, and their university by staying silent about rape.
I was never involved with a fraternity when I was an undergrad, and never partied at a frat house. It is unjust and inaccurate to say that all fraternity brothers are like the men in this story. But when I think back to how getting drunk was a regular part of campus life for both Greek and non-Greek (including Your Working Boy, for sure) when I was at LSU (this was the 1980s, when it was legal for 18 year olds to drink), it is very, very easy to imagine the same kind of thing that happened at UVA happening at my college, and many others. To be clear: I don’t know that it did, or does, but boy, does the Rolling Stone description of the drunken scene outside UVA frat houses, especially during Rush Week, sound familiar.
In other news of powerful men getting away with raping drunk or drugged women, more and more women are emerging with allegations that Bill Cosby attacked them. The Washington Post had a long, brutal story about this yesterday.  By the time this is over, there won’t be anything left of Cosby. If even a fraction of these stories are true, then good; let justice come down on Cosby, on UVA, and on all who have victimized the weak and gotten away with it.

The American Conservative,C,RIP The New Republic | The American Conservative," 
That’s probably it for TNR. It was an interesting and intermittently great 100 years.
— Jacob Weisberg (@jacobwe) December 4, 2014
That’s really all there is to say about the news that Frank Foer and Leon Wieseltier — Leon Freaking Wieseltier, a name that’s synonymous with The New Republic itself — have been cashiered (or cashiered themselves) by Chris Hughes, the Facebook dude who bought the magazine. Of course there’s a lot more to say about it, but it’s hard to imagine an epitaph quite like that tweet from former TNR staffer Weisberg.
Oh, wait, here’s a great one:
TNR owner Chris Hughes just traded Frank Foer and Leon Freakin’ Wieseltier for an editor that used to work at Gawker. Nice work, champ.
— Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) December 4, 2014
 
(And now for some unkind gloating: Frank Foer greeted the debut of TAC with a TNR essay calling “Buchanan’s Surefire Flop”. Well, we’re still here; where he? This is a good time to remind fans of The American Conservative to remember us in your end-of-year giving. Two generous donors have agreed to match all the gifts TAC receives through December 31, up to $20,000 — so your tax-exempt donation goes twice as far. Donate here, or be responsible for the first Larison Listicle, if it comes to that.)
TNR is moving to New York City, and will concentrate on being clickbaity, following the strategy of Hughes, who is thirty years old, and the ex-Yahoo! manager he hired to run the venerable magazine, which is now going to focus on being a “digital media company.” Okay, but the magazine’s digital media company’s journalistic credibility is collapsing in real time. Look:
Dear @TNR and @chrishughes, please immediately remove me from your masthead as a Contributing Editor. http://t.co/au7HNKDvoq
— Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) December 4, 2014
Yair Rosenberg, quoting an unnamed source inside the magazine, reports that nearly the entire staff of senior editors and contributing editors is gearing up to quit. 
This makes me think of the freakout among the media and cultural elite when Tina Brown took over the New Yorker back in 1992. At the magazine, 24 writers resigned or retired.  And you know what? Tina Brown, for all her many faults, revived the magazine, and made it breathe again.
Somehow, this does not feel like a Tina Brown moment for TNR.
I share the shock and frustration of many Washington and New York writers and editors over the death of TNR, but let’s remember that TNR’s kind of journalism doesn’t pay for itself. Magazines like TNR — and TAC — survive thanks to the generosity of donors, or the deep pockets of very rich owners. What’s distressing is that the rich kid who bought one of the most respected titles in American political and cultural journalism has used his millions to destroy it. It’s like buying Carnegie Hall and turning it into a Dave & Buster’s. The digital economy needs to produce a better quality of ultrawealthy philanthropist.
UPDATE: Read every word of Jonathan Chait’s eulogy for TNR. Excerpt:
I expect the circumstances surrounding TNR’s transformation will be framed as a matter of modernity versus tradition. There is certainly an element of this. At the magazine’s 100th anniversary gala two weeks ago, where Hughes, Foer, Wieseltier, and Hughes’s new CEO, Guy Vidra, all spoke, the speeches took a sharply, awkwardly divergent tone. Foer and Weiseltier gave soaring paeans to the magazine’s immense role in shaping American liberal thought. Hughes and Vidra used words like brand and boasted about page views, giving no sense of appreciation at all for the magazine’s place in American life. In a comic moment, Vidra mispronounced Foer’s name. I happened to run into Wieseltier a few days after the gala, and when he asked me what I thought, I told him he and Foer won the debate.
But the conflict between Hughes and most of the staff of The New Republic is not about technology. Foer and the staff, with the exception of Wieseltier, are comfortable with modernity. They are joyous bloggers, and willingly submitted to the introduction of cringe-worthy Upworthy headlines to their stories and other compromises one must make with commercial needs.
The problem, rather, is that Hughes and Vidra are afflicted with the belief that they can copy the formula that transformed the Huffington Post and BuzzFeed into economic successes, which is probably wrong, and that this formula can be applied to The New Republic, which is certainly wrong.
 UPDATE.2: Alan Jacobs has a strong remembrance. Excerpts:
If you hear anyone say, “Good grief, The New Republic isn’t dead, it’s just moving to New York and transitioning from being a magazine to being a‘vertically integrated digital media company’ — you can safely ignore that person.The New Republic is dead and Chris Hughes killed it. You can rejoice in that fact, lament it, feel nothing; but it remains a fact.
… But those long essay-reviews that Wieseltier ran remained a model for much of my own periodical writing. Even when they were wrong, or widely considered wrong, they were confident, expansive, audacious in the scope of their claims: think of Wieseltier’s own infamous hatchet-job on Cornel West, or Martha Nussbaum’s incisive (I say) demolition of Judith Butler, or Ruth Franklin’s nuanced and complex reading of Jonathan Littell’s The Kindly Ones.
I first came to Washington in the fall of 1988, as an intern with a political consultancy. That’s when I discovered TNR, which was then in its Michael Kinsley heyday. It was a glorious magazine, I thought, and I devoured each issue. I’m not sure when I lost touch with it; probably when I left DC in 1995 and moved to Florida to write about movies. In 1999, when I was living in New York and had begun to write about politics more often, I went back to it every now and then, but it just wasn’t the same.
I’m honestly not sure if the magazine that died today is the same magazine whose demise I mourn, because I haven’t read it other than the occasional web piece for years now. I do wonder, though, what responsibility I and people like me have for the collapse of magazines like TNR. If enough people had subscribed to it, perhaps it wouldn’t have fallen into the hands of the rich young boob who destroyed it. It’s too late now, but there are plenty more of us not-for-profit opinion magazines out there who would very much appreciate your subscription — or your tax-deductible donation.
I am especially appreciative of the TAC donors in my readership who aren’t conservatives, but who give because they want to preserve our voice on the Right, and in the public square. I need to pay this forward by finding a left-of-center magazine whose voice I appreciate, even if I disagree with its editorial line, and buy a subscription. And I need to re-up my lapsed subscriptions to magazines on the Right. I have so little time to read now that they sometimes pile up, which leads to my forgetting to renew them. But supporting little magazines is important for reasons beyond the information you find in their pages or pixels. The world without The New Republic shows why.

The American Conservative,C,Bringing Back Husbandry | The American Conservative,"America’s agrarian culture is suffering. Today’s average farmer or rancher is 58 years old, and on the verge of retirement. Whereas in 1840, almost 70 percent of our labor force worked in agriculture, a mere two percent were doing so in 2000. Most farm operators depend on outside income in order to survive—and “In just five years,” notes Vox, “The US experienced a net loss of 90,000 farms.”
Yet Forrest Pritchard—owner of Smith Meadows Farm and author of Gaining Ground: A Story of Farmers’ Markets, Local Food, and Saving the Family Farm—says “there’s never been a better time to get into farming.” Pritchard published Gaining Ground last year, and has already garnered considerable acclaim in the agrarian community. Modern Farmer profiled his book in July 2013. He now travels regularly, speaking at conferences and talking about his farm.
Gaining Ground presented a different face to the sustainable farming movement: Smith Meadows Farm has been in Pritchard’s family for seven generations, but was steadily losing money. “In 1996, I returned from college to my family’s farm and found it in complete shambles,” he writes. “My parents had given up on ever making a profit from farming, and had taken jobs in the city to make ends meet. …The land didn’t generate enough profit for us to even buy our own food. Our family farm, just like thousands of others across the country, was undeniably broken.”
Pritchard’s book isn’t really a story of entrepreneurial innovation (like Joel Salatin’s works), nor is it representative of the boutique farming that has recently come into vogue. His story is one of renewal, of bringing a dying family farm back to life.

After parking by the farm store, Pritchard greets me with a firm handshake and begins his tour of the farm. Pritchard is a meat farmer, and regularly rotates cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, and turkeys to fresh paddocks of grass. The livestock are never fed animal by-products or given growth hormones or antibiotics.
While we walk over to where the cows are pasturing, I ask Pritchard if he ever intends to expand his enterprise—to grow produce, say, or to sell dairy products. He would rather focus on being a meat farmer, he says. It’s not just that he can barter and trade for all the produce he needs at weekend farmer’s markets; he also wants to keep improving the quality of his current enterprise. “You can spend your entire life just focusing on raising one breed of cattle,” he notes.
While the farm has grown considerably over time, Pritchard says he’s learned to say no—to limit his farm to what it’s capable of producing, and to not stretch himself (or his land) too far. While many farmers have felt pressure to specialize and industrialize their productions in order to turn a profit, Pritchard takes a longer view—noting that, at his current size and productivity levels, he has built a successful customer base, is garnering a profit, and is still keeping his land healthy.
Pritchard then reminds me of the difference in the air. I realize that, surrounded by animals usually associated with pungent odors of excrement, I can barely smell their presence. This, Pritchard notes, is one of the most noticeable differences between grass-fed livestock and their industrially-farmed counterparts. Livestock who are out grazing all day don’t leave the same pungent odors. On this farm, all you can smell is fresh air and grass.
Pritchard believes industrialized methods have changed more than just the smell of a farm, however. They have also had a markedly deleterious impact on the next generation of agrarians. For 50 to 60 years, Pritchard says, “we’ve done a great job of creating inexpensive food abundance, and decreasing quality of life and satisfaction [for farmers and their families].” Kids who grew up beside “manure lagoons and spray houses,” who saw their parents scraping to get by, barely turning a profit, have no desire to inherit such an enterprise. “Who wants to sign up for that?” Pritchard asks.
In order to save his family farm, Pritchard has worked hard to “make a normal business structure, where you get a return on business. You gotta make a profit.” Pritchard also notes that he’s careful not to put too much pressure on his son, who is still quite young, to follow in his footsteps. “A childhood is an important thing to have,” he says. “I don’t want him to feel forced from a young age.” Pritchard himself remembers having a delightful childhood on this very farm, having the ability to roam and explore even amidst chores and schoolwork. He wants to make sure his son has the same experiences, so that he will associate this farm with joy and love, not merely drudgery and duty. This balance of involvement and freedom, exploration and responsibility, “creates a deep impact.”

After his tour of the chickens and turkeys, Pritchard shows me the pigs, grazing in the back area of the property. As the pigs nibble at my boots, Pritchard tells me that an apprentice once bemoaned the harmful effect they seemed to have on the land. Their fierce appetites turn all green things into piles of mud. But appearances are deceiving: once the pigs have moved on and the soil has rested, plants grow back more lush than ever.
Pritchard crouches down in the dirt and pushes away a clump of trampled sod with his hands. “Not all patches of land are as perfect as this,” he says, “but this is what we’re aiming for.” Beneath the sod—a natural covering of trampled grass, due to the activity of animals on the property—are loose, lush clumps of earth. The soil is black and moist, and even in November, sprouts of new grass are pushing up out of the ground. ”This is new life,” Pritchard says. It just takes time to see it.
Pritchard considers himself a soil farmer as much as a meat farmer. As the title of his book suggests, Smith Meadows farm really is an enterprise focused on “gaining ground,” replenishing and renewing earth that has suffered for centuries, due to chemicals and overwork. With time and careful diligence, Pritchard is trying to reverse the soil depletion of generations past. And he gets as excited about this as he does the beef and chickens that roam the property.
There’s a beautiful longevity to this fixation on the soil. Unlike the consumeristic approach of many farmers, who steadily deplete the health of the soil through overwork and undernourishment, Pritchard is adamant about maintaining the health of the dirt itself. Of course it makes sense that tending the soil will eventually result in a myriad of benefits for Pritchard. His livestock will continue to have lush grass, which will in turn result in their health and future profitability.
But Pritchard is also dedicated to a generational view of farming, and wants this farm to reach its eighth generation of stewardship. It is exactly this sort of generational methodology that encourages farmers to seek the good of their ground, no matter the short-term challenges or difficulties. If a certain piece of property needs to “rest” for several months (as property grazed by pigs must), Pritchard sets it aside readily. He is looking to the future, and knows that rest is a necessary gift, to the land and to himself.
As Pritchard put it in his interview with Modern Farmer,
I think there’s probably a bit of a difference between a first-generation person who is very interested in wanting to farm maybe for philosophical reasons, or maybe because they think it’s a sound business decision and farmers who have been born into the land and have been surrounded by fields and forests and streams and all these things. You have a real sense of stewardship that becomes a multi-generational perspective if it’s not about one farmer. It’s about the generation before and the generation that comes afterwards.
Wendell Berry has pointed this out in countless essays: to him, it illustrates an important difference between modern farming and the classical concept of “husbandry.” Husbandry is about a more loving, devoted, selfless care than most modern farmers exhibit. It’s about cultivating a holistic health, in soil and land, that transcends profit. “Husbandry,” writes Berry, “is the name of all the practices that sustain life by connecting us conservingly to our places and our world; it is the art of keeping tied all the strands in the living network that sustains us.” (“Renewing Husbandry,” 2004.) By making agriculture into a science and an industry, rather than a domestic and familial vocation, we have lost an appreciation for holistic flourishing. “The modern farm is understood as a surface on which various mechanical operations are performed, and to which various chemicals are applied,” writes Berry. “The under-surface reality of organisms and roots is mostly ignored.”
But soil husbandry, that appreciation of the land which includes conscientious care for its earth, leads to true health. As Berry writes in his 2006 essay, “On the Soil and Health,” “The soil has living creatures in it. It has live roots in it, perennial roots if it is lucky. If it is the soil of the right kind of farm, it has a farm family growing out of it.”

Pritchard finishes his tour of the farm, and we head back to the farm store. The store works entirely on an honor system: people grab the products they want from the meat freezer, and then put their payment in a money box before they leave.
We sit on the front porch, and Pritchard talks about his hopes for the future. Though he wasn’t originally interested in outreach, he now sees speaking and writing as his “way of giving back.”
“Every farmer is deeply interested in holding onto their farm,” he says. Their biggest challenge is “getting on board with the changing narrative of their story.” As consumers seek out more organic, sustainably farmed products, some farmers are hesitant to absorb the practices, seeing them as merely “trendy.”
But Pritchard combats this idea with a vehemence. He believes that organic, sustainable farming isn’t trendy, “it’s ancient, multi-generational, and multi-ethnic.” Indeed, he’s written a new book on the subject, which will be released in September 2015. In it, Pritchard interviews 18 different farmers from around the U.S., sharing their stories and recipes.
Pritchard hopes this book will reach the next generation of farmers. “I’m worried about the 20-year-olds,” he says. Though many young up-and-coming farmers are enthusiastic about organic methodologies, they aren’t fluent in the business know-how necessary to maintain a farm. “You gotta combine sustainability with economics,” Pritchard says. “You gotta make a profit.”
But Pritchard sees the new opportunities provided by social media and burgeoning farmer’s markets. He sees the rise of CSA’s (community-supported agriculture), Whole Foods, and even some middle-man companies (like From the Farmer DC), helping connect consumers with local farms. He sees the popularity of the locavore movement, and his own eager base of customers. And he tells me that farmers today have a “colossal opportunity” to succeed. Having ”lived both sides of it,” Pritchard sees a bright future for Smith Meadows Farm—and for sustainable agriculture.

The American Conservative,C,Is Clickbait the End of Online News? | The American Conservative,"Recently, “clickbait” has become one of the most frequently lobbed pejoratives on the Internet, but what does it mean exactly? Many might point to Buzzfeed as the quintessential culprit, with enticingly-titled articles under large yellow tags like “LOL,” “omg,” “cute,” “wtf,” etc.; but editor-in-chief Ben Smith insists those accusations simply aren’t true, claiming that their attention-grabbing headlines don’t promise more than they deliver and therefore aren’t clickbait. The Atlantic’s James Hamblin ponders his claim and mulls on how best to define the phenomenon:
BuzzFeed is great at delivering on the curiosity it creates, but it’s misleading to say that it doesn’t rely on curiosity gaps. Great journalism at every point on the information-entertainment spectrum has long relied on curiosity to draw people into a story that they otherwise wouldn’t care about.
Hamblin ultimately concludes that making clickbaiting a sin unique to Buzzfeed isn’t fair, as every headline and story competes for attention, with varying amounts of honesty in advertising:
…the market demand goes well beyond only the topics that lend themselves to needing to be told.
Maybe that’s the best definition then, of clickbait: Did this post need to exist, or did you just make a thing for the sake of making a thing? In which case, BuzzFeed does Clickbait. So does pretty much everyone.
Thus, all article-headline pairings fall on a spectrum ranging from more to less manipulative. Online audiences are understandably upset by this trend of false advertising, or even just by the sinking feeling of being duped as they instinctively click on a pointless (yet interesting) article. But the sheer bulk of viral news options creates odd pressures on online news: traditional news can’t always depend on competitive traffic rates, and many websites are essentially stuck feeling they must be as flashy as their competitors. Eventually, everything starts to look and sound a little like Buzzfeed.
It’s an understandably depressing phenomenon to those who love the professionalism and respectability of traditional media. For example, longtime readers of Time magazine who subscribe to the publication’s Facebook feed are undoubtedly surprised when they are barraged with stories like “There Was an Entire Category About Beyoncé on Jeopardy Last Night” and “Kim Kardashian’s Butt Might Just Break the Internet Today.” Does this signal a decline in journalism?
Hamblin is not so pessimistic:
Among cynical readers given to labeling everything clickbait, there seems to be an assumption that editors and writers live and die by the number of clicks they generate. That’s rarely true, and only less so as sites move away from banner ads and find better ways of monetizing based on the quality of content rather than the quantity of people exposed. That bodes well for the readers who prefer only-publish-what-we-really-love kinds of sites to high-output hit-or-miss content mills. Some call it the Slow Web movement, or simply the dream.
The “Slow Web” concept is encouraging in an age obsessed with newness and loudness. If Buzzfeed and its kind are the checkout-stand tabloids of the Internet, websites operating within the Slow Web ideal are the newspapers, and their regular readers are subscribers.
For instance, compare Buzzfeed to Mallory Ortberg and Nicole Cliffe’s The Toast. This website is about as niche as can be, with articles almost exclusively centered on humorist, feminist interpretations of art, cultural, and literary history. Sure, the Toast’s content (entertaining as it may be) appeals to a tiny fraction of web traffic—but to the editors, that’s fine. The Toast has its place on the Internet, and it has carved out that space without desperately bidding for universal appeal via clickbait.
In the case of news websites, there’s an element of “boring” that understandably must persist. We can’t all be humorists, after all. But news websites can still deliberately craft an online brand that reflects grace, thoughtfulness, and professionalism. The sad online face of Time pales in comparison to the contemplative news space at Hamblin’s own Atlantic. News services attempting to cater to everyone on the Internet are drawn inexorably towards the lowest common denominator—and at the end of the day, that’s not what anyone wants.

The American Conservative,C,Israel’s Early Elections | The American Conservative,"Netanyahu has blown up his coalition government:
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on Tuesday made the dramatic move of firing Economics Minister and Yesh Atid Chairman Yair Lapid as well as Justice Minister and Hatnua Chairwoman Tzipi Livni, spelling the end of the coalition government.
The move comes on the heels of a failed meeting between Netanyahu and Lapid on Monday night, in which the two were unable to salvage the coalition that has been rocked by numerous tensions, prime among them in recent weeks the Jewish State Law that would enshrine Israel’s status as the nation-state of the Jewish people.
The coalition has reportedly broken up over a number of issues, including criticism by coalition members of the government’s settlement construction in East Jerusalem and its handling of relations with the U.S. Netanyahu has governed in a way that made it impossible for the coalition to survive, but now that it is finished Netanyahu stands to benefit. Perversely, Likud will gain seats in early elections, so the demise of the coalition government will probably end up putting Netanyahu in an even stronger position domestically. J.J. Goldberg writes:
The latest opinion poll, published Sunday by Haaretz, showed that if elections were held today for a new Knesset, Likud would rise from 18 seats to 24 in the 120-member body, while Yesh Atid would drop from 19 seats to 11.
The party to the right of Likud, Naftali Bennett’s Jewish Home, would rise from 12 to 16. Labor would drop from 15 to 13, Tzipi Livni’s Hatnuah from 6 to 4 and Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu from 13 to 11 and Shas from 11 to 6.
So the next Israeli government seems likely to be even more dominated by hard-line nationalists and pro-settler politicians than the current one. That’s not entirely surprising, but it is certainly discouraging news. It more or less guarantees that U.S.-Israel relations will continue to worsen over the next two years, and it will keep Netanyahu securely in place for the foreseeable future.

The American Conservative,C,The Moral Path to Peace | The American Conservative,"Humanity faces no greater challenge in the 21st century than averting conflict among peoples and civilizations. It is curious and revealing that experts in international relations and political science generally seem not to be beyond themselves with worry that this century might see the war that will make all previous wars look minor. A deteriorating relationship between China and the United States and more arrogance and obduracy in the Middle East are but the most obvious possible sources of a great conflagration.
Superficiality in defining the dangers or delay in addressing them could have horrendous consequences. Yet discussions of how to minimize conflict typically neglect what may be the most important part of the problem. In the West particularly, it is common to assume that general enlightenment will remove obstacles to peace—this despite the fact that we need only look to the century preceding this one, the most murderous and inhumane in all of history, to recognize that the spread of supposedly sophisticated ideas and science does not reduce the intemperance, belligerence, or cruelty of human beings. It only provides them with new means of asserting their will.
Many in the West expect that certain political and economic arrangements will promote peace—“democracy” and “markets” being perhaps the most popular at the moment. They think that universal suffrage and economic interdependence will be salutary. Many hope that international agreements and increasing the influence of the United Nations will keep the peace. Behind some prescriptions for lessening tension there lingers a sentimental notion of the brotherhood of man. As fellow human beings, can’t we just hug? Meanwhile, those who consider themselves more realistic favor balance-of-power theorizing.
But most attempts to deal with conflict do not deal in any depth with what may be the very core of the problem, man’s moral predicament. Proceeding from a dubious or incomplete understanding of the basic moral terms of human existence, scholars and others exaggerate what elaborate, clever international arrangements or techniques can do to lessen tension. The trouble is that when passions run high even the most efficacious measures can be swept away in the blink of an eye. In fraught, very tense circumstances peace will have a chance only if the actors involved are not only experienced, knowledgeable, and creative, but capable of withstanding, in themselves as well as others, the onrush of rashness, belligerence, and ethnic-nationalistic fervor. Such urges can be tamed in the end only by strong character, including habits of restraint and caution. You want peace? Then you need peaceful individuals.
Yet the subject that may be most important seems largely alien to the Western intellectual elites. I have in mind the moral and cultural preconditions of peace. They are crucial, first, because efforts to avoid conflict are likely to be unsuccessful unless those involved have a certain kind of will and imagination, second, because the relative importance of other aspects of how to deal with conflict are best assessed in light of the most complete view of what makes human beings tick. That the subject of the moral and cultural preconditions of peace receives far less attention than other topics seems a sign that Western intellectuals may not be well equipped to deal with the most pressing problem of the new century. Upbringing and education in the West may have to be significantly revised.
In exploring the issue of morality we must, partly because we find ourselves in a globalizing age, guard against intellectual provincialism, presentism, and other myopia. We need to repair to the historical experience of mankind. We should be willing, at minimum, to question the prevalent view of modern Western intellectuals that moral values are merely “subjective” or that moral beliefs are just the idiosyncratic creatures of historical circumstance. If we think more historically and internationally, a different possibility emerges. Amidst a wide variety of beliefs in the human past and present the open-minded scholar finds what looks like a shared, if variously expressed, sense of higher values, a universal dimension. The ancient Greeks called these values the good, the true, and the beautiful. The great moral and religious systems give primacy to the good, that is, to moral universality. In these traditions ecumenical research finds far-reaching transcultural and transhistorical agreement on what is the central moral problem of human existence: that the human will is cleft between higher and lower potentialities and man is his own worst enemy.
National arrogance and economic ruthlessness are among the obvious and palpable threats to international harmony, but they are but instances of the more general danger that societies and their leaders, instead of interacting on the level of what is morally, aesthetically and intellectually noblest in each, will interact at their worst, when most self-absorbed, grasping, and intense. Enlightened self-interest, as opposed to crude, short-sighted self-interest, can go a long way towards keeping competing parties from clashing, but a mere coincidence of partisan wills provides no stable and lasting basis for peace. That popular Western culture is today spreading around the world creates a commonality of sorts, but it is a fragile, very questionable likemindedness. This popular culture is almost uniformly disdainful of the moral and cultural traditions of mankind, including those of the Western world, and is perceived by many as a threat to their most deeply held beliefs. Because of its crudities and vulgarities it antagonizes rather than appeals to the more discerning and discriminating representatives of the peoples of the world.
No observation would seem to be more richly confirmed by the historical record than that human beings are morally cleft, to the core, between higher and lower potentialities. Yet this crux of the human predicament is strangely denied or ignored in most Western attempts today to find a way to harmonious and just arrangements. One thinks, for example, of the long-influential moral rationalism of a John Rawls, with its propensity for wholly ahistorical ratiocination. The Rawls who was widely celebrated would have human beings step behind “the veil of ignorance” and consider policies without regard to how they might affect them personally. “Reasonableness” would then preside over deliberation, and justice and harmony would be served.
The same fondness for abstract theorizing and reluctance to think historically and concretely marks theories of communicative or deliberative democracy. Sound policy and harmony are expected to emerge from never-ending conversation that excludes no legitimate groups. There is something very abstract and even dream-like about these theories. They assume what must not be assumed, that human beings are interested in listening to competing views. They are not. They want their own way. They think of opposition as annoying and as something to be overcome. What these theorists do not quite realize is that when people do show a genuine willingness to consider the ideas of others, it is because they have learnt to control the passions that would close them down intellectually.
Openness of mind presupposes a special, rather sturdy moral self-discipline and habituation. The framers of the U.S. Constitution set up a system that would encourage debate and compromise. Americans would be governed by their “deliberate sense.” But the framers were acutely aware that for this system to work those active within it would have to be capable of self-restraint and be willing to respect the views of others. Their system had demanding moral and cultural preconditions. A certain character type—I like to call it the “constitutional personality”—had to be available if genuine deliberation were to take place.
More recent theorizing about how to achieve communication and harmony does not explore in depth how to create the moral and cultural conditions favorable to deliberation, dispassionate judgment, and compromise. Exhibiting ahistorical and sentimental leanings, today’s theorists simply assume that when people operate in a more progressive, egalitarian setting they will be spontaneously predisposed to reasonableness and to hearing the arguments of others. This is wishful thinking. Theories of this abstract, rather dreamy type have limited value in discussions of domestic politics, and they are wholly inadequate for international relations. There is need for a more realistic, robust understanding of the real sources of open-mindedness and civilized conduct.
In the end, only moral character, supported by general culture, can fortify the self in man that wants openness to argument and respect for others. It used to be regarded as the central purpose of civilization to assist individuals in reining in their least admirable traits so that more admirable ones could be developed. Only protracted moral and cultural exertions and habituation, encouraged by the surrounding society, bring forth people of this kind. In proportion as the people of a society fall short, they undermine not only their own well-being and the cohesion of their society but also international relations.
Until fairly recently, it was taken for granted by most in the Western world, as it was in the East, that human beings are torn between desires that enhance existence and ones that, though they may bring short-term pleasure, are destructive of a deeper meaning and are potentially diabolical. To realize what the ancient Greeks called eudaimonia, happiness, a person must learn to discipline his appetites of the moment, try to extinguish some of them, with a view to his own enduring higher good. Happiness does not refer to a maximization of pleasure but to the special sense of well-being and self-respect that attends living nobly and responsibly. It is for the sake of this higher life that a person foregoes momentary pleasures and advantages.
The good life has many aspects and prerequisites—moral, intellectual, aesthetic, political, and economic—but there was widespread agreement in the old Western society, whether Greek, Roman, or Christian, that realizing life’s higher potential ultimately depends on the person’s character and quality of will. A person who lacks the strength to act rightly cannot achieve happiness by dint of intellectual brilliance, imaginative power, or economic productivity.
According to the old Western tradition and corresponding traditions in the East, society should encourage the kind of working on self that will build meaning and worth into personal and social existence. Whether the goal is the happiness and nobility of a worldly life of the kind that Aristotle and Confucius advocate or the special peace of holiness in which religion culminates, there is no substitute for the protracted, often difficult effort of will.
Note carefully that the most important measure of progress is the quality of actions performed. “I am the way and the truth and the life,” said Jesus of Nazareth. The statement implies that its validity could be tested only in practical action. In Buddhism, the right Way is the diligent working on self to extinguish needless or destructive desire. In the Dhammapada, which is attributed in its general spirit to the Buddha, we read about the path to Nirvana: “You yourself must make an effort.”
In the West, the most radical and influential challenge to this view of man’s moral predicament came from Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). Rousseau was, among other things, the main intellectual inspiration for the French Jacobins, who spearheaded the French Revolution that started in 1789. For Rousseau, the old view of human nature is profoundly mistaken. Man is not chronically torn between good and evil. There are in man’s own nature no lower inclinations, certainly no original sin, as Christianity alleges. Man was born good. In his primitive, presocial, “natural” state, man was pure, simple, peaceful, and happy, and that remains his nature. The evil in society is due not to some perversity in man but to perverse norms, habits, and institutions. Destroy that society, and man’s goodness will be released.
Rousseau and his many followers pioneered a revolution in the understanding of morality that continues to reverberate. Virtue ceased to be a matter of character and right willing. It became primarily a state of feeling and imagination, an attribute of the “heart.” Rousseau gave prominence to tearful empathy, “pity,” as a sign of human nobility. The old measure of moral virtue was loving, responsible action. Good conduct was the outgrowth of sometimes painful self-scrutiny and a diligent working on self. But for Rousseau man was good by nature, so there was no need for man to be on guard against his own lower impulses. Neither was there any need for traditions, social groups, or institutions to buttress morality. On the contrary, it was by liberating man from such traditional constraints that natural goodness would reassert itself. Rousseau and his followers shifted the central struggle of human existence from the inner life of persons to the social and political arena, where the virtuous had to defeat evil forces.
Rousseau’s redefinition of morality, which by itself had a profound influence in the modern Western world, coincided historically with the kind of rationalism that seized the initiative with the Enlightenment. Its conception of reason was heavily slanted in the direction of mathematics, geometry, and natural science. Representatives of the Enlightenment rejected the traditional view of man as superstitious and unscientific. They had no place for ancient moral wisdom. A happy life was not dependent on moral character but required a fundamental restructuring of society according to enlightened ideas.
Rousseauistic sentimentality and Enlightenment rationalism might seem to be wholly different approaches to life, but they became close and frequent allies. Both belittled the need for moral character. Selfishness, ruthlessness, avarice, and conflict were not due to any chronic human weakness but could be overcome by remaking the social and political exterior. Sentimental idealism and rationalism came together in social engineering, dreamy idealistic visions of the future providing the goal and technocratic manipulation providing the method. In the area of international relations, sentimental virtue and technocratic thinking eventually combined in the idea of an enlightened and vaguely egalitarian global culture, often summarized in the term “democracy.” According to this ideology, the historically evolved characteristics of peoples, societies, and civilizations will soon give way to a proper transnational ideological homogeneity. History will “end.”
This notion of emerging global harmony neglects the central issue of moral character. Equally troublesome is the presumption that persons, societies, and civilizations should give up their traditional distinctiveness. Let me suggest, to the contrary, that what might actually be the most conducive to cordial relations is to cherish—not disdain—historically evolved identities, though to cherish them in a particular manner. It is not contradictory or even paradoxical to view this respect for historical particularity as a kind of cosmopolitanism. It is a cosmopolitanism that would encourage particular persons, societies, and civilizations to be themselves while living up to their own highest standards. The cosmopolitanism I have in mind affirms both cultural distinctiveness and pan-cultural unity, which it can do because each is anchored in a similar moral and cultural striving. In order to assist peace, political, economic, scientific, and other efforts to reduce conflict must be informed by moral realism, most especially by a recognition of the need for leaders to have self-control and a corresponding cultural sensibility. I call this approach to peace “cosmopolitan humanism.”
I hasten to add what should be obvious, that sometimes cultural diversity expresses provincialism, intolerance, and brutality and is a major source of conflict. Diversity that is not humanized by moral and other universality but manifests self-absorbed eccentricity engenders friction and instability. Nationalistic arrogance and bullying caused terrible upheaval and suffering in the last two centuries. The great problem with what is ordinarily called multiculturalism is that it is quite unable to distinguish between diversity that enriches and diversity that degrades human life.
The history and culture of a people is the source of its social cohesion, outlook on life, and sense of direction and self-worth. Its past shapes it in countless ways, some of which are not even visible to the superficial eye. Every people has less than admirable traits of which it would do well to try to divest itself, but it also has admirable qualities and great achievements in which it can take pride. These must be absorbed and appreciated anew by each generation. Efforts in the present to improve society need to be adapted, through creativity, to the historically evolved cultural heritage. A people cannot give its best without being itself. To impose on a people a supposedly superior pattern of conduct that is wholly alien to its traditions produces disorientation and a split personality: the alien patterns can only produce mechanical and artificial imitation, while putting the people at odds with its deepest sources of self-respect and meaning.
When people in different societies develop what is most admirable in their culture, however, they may at one and the same time be cultivating their own heritage and a common human ground, to the extent that their work is inspired by the universal values of goodness, truth, and beauty. As they culturally enrich their own society, they strengthen their ties to other peoples. Though inevitably marked by the distinctive past and present of their particular society, their cultural efforts are in their expression of man’s higher humanity a bridge to equivalent attempts in other societies.
Genuine human universality has nothing to do with uniformity. It consists of universal qualities that are always adapted to the historical circumstance of time and place. This is done by means of human creativity that synthesizes the universal and the particular. Cosmopolitan humanism is based on the recognition that many different, historically formed cultural identities and individual creative acts can manifest one and the same higher quality of inspiration—though obviously more or less successfully in particular cases. Representatives of different cultures can come together as fellow human beings not despite but through their cultural individualities, the latter sharing not all particulars but the same quality.   
Cosmopolitan humanism, then, simultaneously and indistinguishably cherishes the unity of purpose that is intrinsic to pursuing life’s higher values and the diversity that must characterize attempts to realize that potential. Moral and cultural activity at their best affirm the unity by harmonizing and dignifying the diversity and affirm the diversity by varying and enriching the unity. This humanizing discipline contrasts sharply with universality that is understood as distinct from and even opposed to particularity and as abstract rather than concrete and particular.
In the Western world especially, it is widely assumed that a culture of enlightenment, democracy, and equality is far along in supplanting the ancient moral and cultural traditions of the world. But supposed progressives seem not to realize the extent to which social and political arrangements that they deem desirable and even take for granted—including respect for individual rights, rule of law, freedoms of speech and association, and tolerance—actually evolved from the old moral and cultural traditions that progressives deem expendable or unacceptable. Many of their designs for society and the world are parasitic on old character traits that they have no plans for trying to preserve. They want behaviors of a certain kind but do not attend to their moral and cultural preconditions.
If there is any truth about human nature in the ancient moral and religious traditions, the progressive mind ignores or downplays the greatest threat to domestic and international peace: that man is his own worst enemy. This is the case not only, as enlightened intellectuals might concede, in that man is sometimes less than fully rational but also in that he is prone to letting egotistical passion and rashness run roughshod over conscience. Leaders and people who are able to show the appropriate self-restraint are such because they are in the habit of scrutinizing and purifying their own motives. Protracted moral and cultural efforts have shaped their character, limiting the self-indulgence that puts them in conflict with others.
Because historical circumstances vary so greatly, societies are bound to differ in how they approach and express respect for higher values. Yet there is among the ancient civilizations of the world a remarkable confluence of moral and cultural sensibility. It includes far-reaching agreement about what constitutes admirable human conduct and good leadership. From China to Europe and the United States there is a rough consensus on the attributes of a great man or gentleman. He is first of all a person of moral integrity. Of particular relevance in this discussion of prospects for cordial relations is the belief that the exemplary person exhibits self-restraint, humility, modesty, dignity, and good manners. The ancient Greeks warned against hubris, against the belief that you are one of the gods. For Christianity, the greatest sin is pride. Our primary moral obligation is not to condemn the weaknesses of others and demand that they improve but to attend to our own weaknesses. Christianity roundly condemns the conceit and moral evasiveness of always finding fault in others. In the words of Jesus of Nazareth,  “Take the log out of your own eye first, and then you will be able to see and take the speck out of your brother’s eye.”
The notion of universality that I associate with cosmopolitan humanism contains no implication that persons, peoples, and civilizations should conform to a single model of life or that universality can be imposed by means of political engineering. It may be helpful to contrast genuine universality with a type of universalism that today is particularly common and influential in the United States. I am referring to an ideologically intense variant of the Enlightenment mindset that assumes a single political system is desirable and even mandatory for all societies and should be everywhere installed, through military means if necessary. I have called this ideology the new Jacobinism. The French Jacobins summarized their putatively universal principles in the slogan “freedom, equality, and brotherhood.” They saw France as the redeemer of nations. The new Jacobins speak of “freedom” and “democracy,” and they have anointed the United States.
It is important to understand how radically that form of universalism departs from the older Western tradition. Although proximate in time, the ideas behind the U.S. Constitution of 1789 and those behind the French Revolution of the same year are fundamentally different. The framers of the Constitution held a view of human nature and society that was essentially classical and Christian, whereas the French Jacobins were inspired by Rousseau.
According to the classical and Christian traditions, moral virtue is indistinguishable from personal character. It is first of all a form of self-rule. It means subduing and ordering the passions. Jacobin virtue, by contrast, is primarily and directly political. It is a sense of moral superiority, of being a benefactor of mankind. Because it thinks of itself as a desire to improve vastly the lives of others, this virtue feels itself entitled to the power needed to change the world. This virtue, then, is not a wish to control and improve self but a wish to control and improve others. Far from curbing the will to power, Jacobin universalism stimulates it.
The U.S. Constitution assumes a need for the opposite, to restrain power, that of the people as well as that of their representatives. America’s leaders were not interested in ideological crusading. They hoped to set a good example for others, not impose their will on them. But the new Jacobins radically re-interpret what they call America’s “Founding principles.” These principles belong to all mankind, they assert, and they justify armed American global hegemony.
The U.S. Constitution granted to the central government only limited and shared sovereignty. It left power for the most part in state and local institutions and, above all, with the people themselves in their private capacities. The purpose of the constitutional arrangement was unity in diversity. The union of states would help harmonize and draw strength from diversity, not abolish it.
Because neo-Jacobin universalism favors abstract, ideological homogeneity and disdains particularity, it runs counter to old American attitudes and Western traditions. In practice as well as theory, abstract universalism means a lack of respect for regional or local diversity and for the special needs and opportunities that they reflect.
It does not follow that the most common form of modern multiculturalism with its cult of diversity and its so-called “historicism” offers a humane alternative. By its frantic and therefore disingenuous denial of universality, postmodernism makes history chaotic. Without a unity or continuity of human experience, no consciousness could exist. There could be no history, only wholly disjointed and therefore meaningless experiential fragments. It is different with what I call cosmopolitan humanism. Though it recognizes and affirms the variety of human existence and its inevitably contextual, contingent, “historical” character, it sees particularity as potentially expressive of universality.
In political theory the school that most sharply attacks historicism is that of Leo Strauss. Interestingly, postmodernism shares with anti-historicist universalism, whether of the Straussian or neo-Jacobin variety, the assumption that universality and particularity are incompatible. The postmodernists attack universality in the name of radical historicity. The anti-historicists disparage historical particularity in the name of ideological universality. Neither side recognizes the possibility of synthesis of universality and particularity, a potential that is central to cosmopolitan humanism.
The dialectical and synthetical relationship of universality and particularity may be suggested in the most general terms. The good, the true, and the beautiful do in one special sense lack specific form: they are magnetic qualities that an infinite number of yet to be completed moral acts, philosophical thoughts, and works of art may have. But in a different sense the good, the true, and the beautiful exist for us only in historical particulars: they are embodied in countless acts, thoughts, and works of art—in loving, morally responsible behavior, wise books and lectures, outstanding poems and compositions—which come alive in the present as we relive and try to absorb them and let them inspire more of the same.
Far from being an ahistorical, abstract standard, genuine universality must be freshly discovered by individuals for themselves in their time and place. It must find expression in concrete particulars. The resulting variety enriches and deepens man’s historical existence.  Because universality has no other opportunities for articulation than the historical circumstances of persons, it can have no single manifestation, only a single qualitative form. Although true universality creates qualitative affinities across borders, it is inimical to a global uniculture. Goodness, truth, and beauty reveal the common human ground as they show themselves in the uniqueness and distinctiveness of persons, peoples, and civilizations.
This kind of particularity harmonizes diversity. It makes for more than a flimsy and transitory unity. When peoples and civilizations cultivate their selfhood at the highest level, their efforts are not only compatible with unity. They are the unity. To the extent that unity is possible among human beings, it is achieved through diversity.
It should be possible to see, then, why cosmopolitan humanism is indistinguishable from patriotism, that is, from a proper love of one’s own society. The genuine patriot, as distinguished from the self-absorbed, arrogant nationalist, cherishes what is admirable about his own traditions, as judged by transnational, universal standards. Without the patriot’s deep rootedness in his own culture’s sense of goodness, truth, and beauty he would not have the preparation and sensitivity to appreciate comparable efforts in other societies. Moral, intellectual, and aesthetic phenomena from around the world that strike rootless, ill-informed, ill-prepared observers as having nothing in common are found by the patriotic cosmopolitan to be both qualitatively kindred and intriguingly, appealingly different.
Cosmopolitan humanism contrasts sharply with the prescriptions for regional or global unification that are advanced by people who have no deep cultural roots and who for that reason are at home in no particular place. For such pseudocosmopolitans no truly common human ground exists and no truly transcultural appreciation is possible. Peace has to them no special moral and cultural preconditions. The dominant breed of Eurocrat exemplifies the type. Just as this person has no strong attachment to any country, so does this person have scant interest in history and even less in the philosophically demanding issues of morality and culture. The typical Eurocrat makes do instead with a smattering of trendy ideas. It is anomalous and potentially dangerous that people with little familiarity with and even a strong prejudice against the moral and cultural traditions of mankind tend to set the tone in discussions of how to achieve better international relations.
A technocratic and presentist cosmopolitanism is not merely ill-conceived, it positively undermines prospects for lessening tensions by diverting attention from what peace and unity most require: that persons, peoples, and civilizations put a resilient check on self-absorption and arrogance and cultivate what is best in their traditions. To stress that need is to make a central philosophical point, but it is first and foremost an urgent call for greater realism in addressing the problem of peace. It is realism in keeping with the shared moral and cultural heritage of humanity.

The American Conservative,C,Deconstructing Western Civilization | The American Conservative,"Damon Linker has a characteristically sharp piece about New York magazine’s 6000+ interview with an anonymous zoophile — in this case, a man whose fetish involves sex with a horse. Linker connects to my initial blog post about this thing, and shares my revulsion at what the magazine has done, and what it means:
[T]his is a very big deal, in cultural and moral terms. No, not the fact of bestiality, which (like incest) has always been with us, but the fact of an acclaimed, mainstream publication treating it as a matter of complete moral indifference.
As I said in my post, it’s not that this interview is going to make people heretofore disinclined to copulate with animals change their minds. It’s that a piece like this is a canary-in-the-coalmine cultural moment. Linker:
Why, then, is the New York interview a big deal? Because it’s perhaps the most vivid sign yet that, in effect, the United States (and indeed the entire Western world) is running an experiment — one with very few, if any, antecedents in human history. The experiment will test what happens when a culture systematically purges all publicly affirmed notions of human flourishing, virtue and vice, elevation and degradation.
But Linker says there are two problems with my analysis (and with the trad reaction in general). First, he says that we trads are wrong to blame relativism for this, saying that it’s more accurate to put the fault down to “an absolute ethic of niceness,” by which he means an increasing refusal to condemn, because that would be mean. I see what he’s saying here: it’s not that people affirm bestiality, but that they refuse to condemn it because hey, if that’s someone’s choice, who am I to judge?
(Of course we know from extensive sociological research that the Millennial generation, at least, can be quite judgmental on a number of topics. But the ones they suspend judgment on are matters of religion, and matters of sexuality. In those cases, niceness reigns.)
I take Damon’s point, but I think this is a distinction without much of a difference. If “niceness” is the ethical rule here, then how is that not de facto relativism?
Linker’s claim that disgust is not a sound basis for setting moral rules is harder to dismiss. When I was growing up in the 1970s, there were still a number of people who had visceral disgust at the sight of interracial couples. That has abated, thankfully, but it’s still present in some people. Same deal with gay couples. This is a case in which relativism is an important factor to consider in moral reasoning. It doesn’t mean disgust is irrelevant to our moral decisions; disgust can be a good general guide to right and wrong. But it does mean that disgust cannot be dispositive, and that we must look past our reactions of disgust and analyze the moral facts of a situation dispassionately. Seeing an 89-year-old man kissing his 26-year-old wife may prompt feelings of disgust, but it tells us nothing about the morality of an elderly man marrying a much younger woman.
But if disgust is not dispositive, and we are taught to believe there is no objective basis outside of consent — a very, very thin barrier — for deciding right and wrong, particularly in sexual matters, then the attitude the New York interviewer, and the editor who approved this interview, take towards the horse-screwer is completely understandable.
Linker’s second criticism of trads — that we may say, as I did, that our civilization is “galloping toward Gomorrah,” but in fact we do not know where this is headed — is a truism. Yes, we may turn this around, but on current trends, I’m not sure on what basis we do that. As Damon rightly says, we don’t have any precedent for running a society in which there is no commonly shared basis for determining right and wrong. Is emotivism and procedural liberalism a solid basis for sustaining a society and a civilization over the long run? I think not. Damon professes not to know, but I read in these lines radical doubt:
Can we do without a publicly affirmed vision of human flourishing? Fulfilling personal preferences (whatever they happen to be), seeking consent in all interactions, and abiding by the imperative of universal niceness — is that sufficient to bring happiness? Or will a world that tells us in a million ways that we are radically undetermined in our ends leave us feeling empty, lost, alone, unmoored, at sea, spiritually adrift?
Read the whole thing. It’s worthwhile. Let me say this again: the danger to society is not that a significant number of people are going to start having sex with animals. The danger comes from a society in which a significant number of people see no real justification for condemning those who have sex with animals. It is to concede that we are no different from animals.
Earlier this year, writing in the Jesuit journal America, psychologist Thomas McGovern wrote about the “lost generation” of young American Catholics.  It’s a review of Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith’s new book Young Catholic America, which is about how “emerging adult” Catholics are abandoning the faith in droves. McGovern writes:
Having taught psychology, religion and ethics at three public universities, I can report that a majority of the multigenerational and multiethnic students who took my courses self-identified as former Catholics. Evangelicals brought fervor to discussions and composed essays using biblical quotations and popular pulpit wisdom. With gratitude for an eye-opening semester, the Latter-Day Saints students gave me inscribed copies of their Book of Mormon. Others spoke of a vague spirituality enabling them to be “comfortable” in and with their lives. The Catholic students, as this book’s sub-title about “emerging adults” (i.e., ages 18 to 23) signals, were mostly out of faith and gone.
Young Catholic America describes the results of the National Study of Youth and Religion, conducted by telephone surveys and personal interviews for three waves (2002-3, 2005, 2007-8) of a longitudinal study. The respondents were 13 to 17 years old at the beginning and 18 to 23 at the last data collection point. Parents, pastors and ministers of religious education and higher education and secondary school educators will find here thought-provoking sociology-of-religion explanations for how, when and why this sample of young people became who they are and what they don’t believe and don’t do any more.

Baby boomer readers may gasp at the historical analysis of their parenting summarized in Chapter 1. Centrifugal forces from 1970 to 2000 generated increasing pluralism in American thinking, labeled by these authors as a “vulgar version of post-modernism.” (One of my true-believer science editors labeled postmodernism the “anthrax of the intellect.”) With truth and standards fragmented in the larger culture—the center did not hold—its effects exacerbated values conflicts within the church in the United States. The authors declare at fault “the inability, and sometimes unwillingness of the parents of the Catholic and ex-Catholic emerging adults we studied—and those half a generation earlier—to model, teach and pass on the faith to their children. At precisely the same moment, older, more communal, taken-for-granted forms of religious practice and catechesis were eroding and sometimes collapsing in American Catholicism.”
McGovern goes on to say this is not just a Catholic thing. He speaks of research showing that undergraduates in the liberal arts are abysmal at articulating anything they’ve learned from their college educations — “a university community’s core faith.” About Catholics, McGovern says Smith et al.’s research shows:
According to this study, three factors foster increased religiosity. First, teens must have strong bonds to religiously committed and supportive family and friends. Second, beliefs must be internalized; faith ought to be a person’s most useful compass for daily decisions, despite myriad secular guides that saturate their life experiences. Third, as Aristotle noted about civic virtue, faith’s principles must be learned first and then behaviorally practiced often.
It makes sense that this must be true for virtue, period, not just religious virtue. This, of course, leads us to philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue, which concerns, broadly, the fate of a society and civilization in which the concept of virtue as a binding and authoritative code barely exists.
I will link here to that infamous New York magazine interview with the zoophile, whom I’ll call Mr. Ed, but I want to reiterate the strongest warnings. There are no graphic, NSFW images attached to it. But it is incredibly disturbing. I think it’s important for those with strong stomachs to read, so you will get an idea of a) how utterly vile this man’s practices are, and more importantly, b) how he uses the all-too-familiar rhetoric of emotivism, tolerance, and understanding to justify his preferences.
Sooner or later, it’s going to be the Benedict Option, or chaos. If you will not have God, you had better pay your respects to Mr. Ed.

The American Conservative,C,Galloping Toward Gomorrah | The American Conservative,"A couple of nights ago, I ran across a lengthy interview in New York magazine, titled, “What It’s Like to Date a Horse.” I thought it was a satire of some sort. It’s not. I’m not linking to it, because it is sick, sick stuff. It’s incredibly graphic, and I had decided not to write about it. But the more I thought about the thing, the more disturbed it made me. Here’s why: What’s significant is not that this deranged behavior happens. It has no doubt always been with us. What’s significant is that this interview appears in a mainstream magazine.
Says the zoophile in the interview: “I love me. I love who I am. I love my sexuality.  … I wish we could talk more openly about sex and alternative sexual interests, or just sex in general.” He says that if we could do that, maybe so many zoophiles wouldn’t kill themselves. More:
Since there’s so much stigma attached to being a zoophile I imagine that means you don’t tell many people. Does it cause a split personality? What is it like for you to have a sexuality that’s not really accepted or understood?

I’m really lucky to have my wife, because nobody would ever guess. …  Having said that, though, you are quite correct that it’s something that makes people feel confused and alone, and they have no idea what to think about what they are, and they can’t talk to anybody. I’ve heard stories of people getting shock or aversion therapy. I really don’t understand the hatred.
Do you wish you could be out and proud?

Absolutely. I’ve always been a very political person, and one of the reasons I started seeing a therapist is because I found that lately I’m having trouble with what people say about zoophiles. The same arguments over and over again, and nobody can support me because they get labeled. It’s been very hard dealing with those emotions and the heaviness of what it would be like to get caught and what’s being said and done to zoophiles, and the fact is, rather than actually engage with us, people would prefer to ignore us.
What have I done? I am a normal, average, hardworking guy. I pay my taxes, I make fairly good money, I have a nice house. I have dogs, I have ferrets, I have cats, a couple of rats, chickens in my backyard I’ve saved from places where they were just going to get killed. What have I done that’s so wrong? What is so wrong about physical contact between [myself and an animal]? And it does bring a weight. The experience of being a zoo adolescent was extremely lonely. I had no one to turn to, nobody to ask questions, and even if I had trusted someone I feel now like I would have gotten bad, heteronormative advice. It was a silent day-to-day struggle.
Yes, well, heaven forbid that somebody would give a freak who wants to poke a horse “bad, heteronormative advice.”
Princeton’s Robert George writes on his Facebook page:
First, please, somebody tell me that the interview in New York Magazine entitled “What It’s Like to Date a Horse” is a fake or some sort of spoof. Second, I will not post it here, because it is too disturbing. I urge friends not to read it unless you have a very, very, very strong stomach. I mention it, reluctantly, only to show that anyone who thought we had already reached the bottom of the slippery slope is mistaken. The descent into Gomorrah continues. I believe it can be reversed, but not simply stopped. “This far and no farther,” is not an option. “He who says A, says B.” Once a set of premises is adopted or endorsed, logic carries one to certain conclusions. One may have a subjective wish (rooted in an aversion, or preference, or lack of interest, or whatever) to where the logic of a position takes one, but a wish (or an aversion, or a preference) is not a principle.
He’s right. Again, I stress that the most disturbing thing about this is not that people who do this exist. It’s that a mainstream American magazine has published something this unspeakably perverse. And not just any mainstream magazine: New York has been a trendsetter since the 1960s. Under its current editor, former New York Times-man Adam Moss, New York has won a slew of National Magazine Awards, including being named 2013′s Magazine of the Year. This isn’t an Al Goldstein rag. This isn’t even the Village Voice.
There’s no way around it: New York magazine is mainstreaming bestiality as an alternative sexuality. It’s just different. Who are you to judge, you bad heteronormative person? How does his relationship with the mare affect you, huh?
One extremely tasteless and morally revolting interview in a leading magazine is not the end of the world. But it is a signpost. It’s not going to make everyone run out and get an animal boyfriend or girlfriend. But it does attempt to weaken an important taboo by giving a sympathetic forum to a deranged man whose behavior deserves the strongest condemnation, and who personally needs help. It’s important to pay attention to this for exactly the reason Robby George says. Ideas have consequences. If your idea is that all consensual sex is good, or at least beyond judgment, and that sexual desire is its own justification, then you have met your consequence in New York‘s anonymous zoophile. If you can stomach reading the thing, it’s rather remarkable how the perv defends himself and his desire using the language and reasoning we have all become familiar with in other contexts.
(And by the way, if the only thing you have to stand on to condemn Captain Equus here is that his girlfriend can’t meaningfully consent, then, well, you are ridiculous.)

The American Conservative,C,Bringing Big Data to the Farm | The American Conservative,"Can family farmers use technology to survive? Quentin Hardy thinks so—in a Sunday article for the New York Times, he writes of generational farmers who are increasingly relying on data and drones to succeed:

The demise of the small family farm has been a long time coming. But for farmers like Mr. Tom, technology offers a lifeline, a way to navigate the boom-and-bust cycles of making a living from the land. It is also helping them grow to compete with giant agribusinesses.

The idea of farmers using technology to “catch up” with Big Ag isn’t necessarily a bad thing—but there may be unintended consequences.
First, it’s important to note that this type of farming encourages farmers to consolidate their farms to one specific crop, thus fighting against the principles of diversity that help keep farmland healthy. As Hardy puts it,
There is an incentive to grow single crops to maximize the effectiveness of technology by growing them at the largest possible scale. Farmers with diverse crops and livestock would need many different systems. Smaller farmers without technology could also grow one crop, but they would not capture most of the gains.
Technology encourages farmers to move too aggressively toward easy-to-grow and easy-to-sell crops that are more easily measured by instruments, rather than keeping some diversity in the fields — an age-old hedge against bad weather and pests…
Farmers can’t afford to buy the amount of equipment that would be necessary to keep up with a diverse farm via technology. Yet if they don’t diversify, it can have a deleterious effect on their soil—not to mention the effect it can have on their livelihood, if that crop fails.
Also, note that this sort of specification requires farmers to a) have a more diverse set of skills, and b) to rely on a greater variety of outside support. “It used to be, if you could turn a wrench you’d be good at farming,” Mr. Burbrink told the Times. “Now you need to know screen navigation, and pinpointing what data should go where so people can plan and predict. You need to be in tune with other people: seed consultants, agronomists, the equipment folks.”
In his book Gaining Ground, seventh-generation family farmer Forrest Pritchard wrote of the long-term costs that can result from relying on technology. Selling equipment and using simpler processes actually saved Pritchard money—he didn’t have to invest as much in the upkeep and maintenance of various piece of equipment. So even if equipment helps a farm grow bigger, it will also make the upkeep a lot more complicated.
Finally, using technology to expand a farm could have long-term consequences, because it can stretch a farm past its natural limits. There is a reason small farms are growing more popular: the more human-scale the enterprise, the higher quality the product. Farms that try to do too much, or grow too big, often badly impact the quality of both their crops and their personal lives. It’s important to consider whether bigger is always better. Perhaps family farmers shouldn’t be trying so hard to compete with the “big guys”—there is a burgeoning market for smaller, sustainably-farmed enterprises. And by tapping into that market, farmers can keep things to a smaller, more healthy scale, without seeing their sales completely fall apart. Of course each area of the United States is unique and different, but it is true that this sort of local production is growing in demand.
Why does all this matter so much? Agriculture in America is changing, restructuring itself to survive in the midst of new technology, aging agrarians, and a changing consumer base. The way that farms modify their methodology will directly impact the future of the agricultural enterprise as a whole. We may have a resurrection of the small, sustainably-produced family farm. Or we may have large, drone-run commodity farms. Perhaps both can live in harmony together—that remains to be seen. But it is important that the former are not completely destroyed by the latter.

The American Conservative,C,Obama’s Reckless Amnesty | The American Conservative,"I do not follow the immigration debate closely, so I do not have a well-informed opinion about the amnesty President Obama just declared for 5 million illegal immigrants, who are in this country in defiance of its laws. But I am gobsmacked that this or any other president would issue an executive order on something as massive as this, without having Congress behind him. It really is outrageous — and the Democrats are going to reap the whirlwind.
Here’s Zoltan Hajnal in The New York Times:

President Obama’s executive order eliminating the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants is good policy. It is the right thing to do. But it is a dangerous move for the Democratic Party.
Yes, immigration is an important issue for most Latinos and Asian-Americans. And yes, 63 percent of Latinos and 66 percent of Asian- Americans voted for Democratic candidates for Congress in the midterms. The executive order could solidify and expand that support for years to come.
But Latinos and Asian-Americans made up only 11 percent of the electorate. Even if immigration were the only issue driving their vote — and it most certainly was not — it could have shifted the national partisan balance of power by only a few percentage points.
Whites, meanwhile, accounted for 75 percent of the electorate. Far more than any other group, whites will decide the fate of the parties in the years to come. Unfortunately for the Democratic Party, the data suggest that immigration very much matters for whites.
Immigrants are moving to almost every corner of the nation. They usually look different from the white majority. And, irrespective of the facts, the dominant narrative maintains that immigrants rely heavily on public services like welfare, education and health care, that immigrants take jobs from native-born workers and lower their wages, and that immigration is leading to cultural decline.
Polls indicate that an overwhelming majority of white Americans view illegal immigration as a serious problem. A third think immigration over all is bad for the country.

Even if you favor the policy Obama is imposing, you had better think long and hard about the meaning of this move by a president. As Ross Douthat said on Sunday:

No defender of Obama’s proposed move has successfully explained why it wouldn’t be a model for a future president interested in unilateral rewrites of other areas of public policy (the tax code, for instance) where sweeping applications of “discretion” could achieve partisan victories by fiat. No liberal has persuasively explained how, after spending the last Republican administration complaining about presidential “signing statements,” it makes sense for the left to begin applying Cheneyite theories of executive power on domestic policy debates.
Especially debates in which the executive branch is effectively acting in direct defiance of the electoral process. This is where the administration has entered extraordinarily brazen territory, since part of its original case for taking these steps was that they supposedly serve the public will, which only yahoos and congressional Republicans oppose.
This argument was specious before; now it looks ridiculous.

Lo, this didn’t take long. Look at this now airing on Louisiana airwaves:

To be clear, linking to that ad does not imply TAC’s endorsement of a candidate. We do not endorse candidates. I’m linking to it to show you how the GOP Senate candidate is pouncing on the Obama amnesty to pound his Democratic opponent. Landrieu didn’t have much of a chance before, but the only question raised by the Obama amnesty is whether or not he’ll break 60 percent on election day. Well, this question too: is this ad a preview of the GOP’s 2016 strategy?

The American Conservative,C,Jindal’s Boilerplate Hawkishness | The American Conservative,"Rosie Gray finds Bobby Jindal trying hard not to annoy too many Republicans on foreign policy:
In a roundtable meeting with reporters before appearing onstage, Jindal came down on basically every side possible in Republican foreign policy.
Gray says that he is trying to “to displease as few people as possible,” but for the most part the people that he went out of his way to placate are the hard-liners in the party. That’s nothing new for Jindal. When he has previously tried saying something on the subject, he has made all the predictable noises about American exceptionalism and “leadership.” He even endorsed the silly and dangerous idea of a League of Democracies in his book. His instincts and voting record in Congress have been conventionally hawkish, and his reliance on Jim Talent and John Bolton for advice confirm that he is listening to all the wrong people. Finally, his position on Syria is terrible:
Jindal said he thinks that destroying ISIS shouldn’t mean the United States should be “deterred from our longer term goal of removing Assad.”
So in addition to supporting the current unnecessary war, Jindal is in favor of regime change in Syria that would produce even more instability and violence. He also said that “every option needs to be on the table to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power,” which lines him up with most other would-be 2016 candidates in their willingness to back an attack on Iran. While he claims to reject the idea that the U.S. should be the “world’s policeman,” it is difficult to find any crises where he thinks the U.S. shouldn’t be actively involved.

The American Conservative,C,The Uses and Abuses of Historical Analogies | The American Conservative,"Richard Fontaine and Vance Serchuk consider the different historical examples that policymakers and politicians cite in their foreign policy arguments:
In their choice of historical analogy, politicians and policymakers often reveal more about their foreign policy worldview than do conventional partisan or ideological labels.
That’s true as far as it goes. What tells us even more about a person’s foreign policy assumptions is how often he falls back on historical analogies and how varied those analogies are. For instance, when a neoconservative or hawk invokes 1938 in response to every single crisis or major event overseas, that mostly tells us that he probably has a very superficial grasp on the particulars of current events. If everything can be reduced to a comparison to the Munich conference and its aftermath, there is no need to make the effort to understand the present-day crisis on its own terms. It also suggests that the person making this comparison is more concerned to score ideological points rather than he is interested in offering relevant analysis. By the same token, citing 1914 as a cautionary tale is potentially just as misleading. While there are tensions between major powers, there is much less danger of a a war between them today than there was a hundred years ago. Invoking the start of WWI can be just as lazy and reflexive as shouting, “Munich!” We should always want our government to be careful “about extending treaty commitments to client states,” and we should always want it to exercise caution and not overreact to foreign crises, but most of the “lessons” they draw from 1914 don’t need the example of 1914 to make sense to us.
Historical analogies can sometimes be useful when they are used to inform a debate and give an audience greater perspective on current events, but they are very often used in crude attempts to shoehorn modern events into convenient ideological stories that advocates for a certain set of policies want to tell. Used this way, analogies are necessarily misleading. They are intended to mislead people so that they accept a policy recommendation that may or may not have made sense decades ago in a completely different situation. They are also used to substitute for analysis of the current situation on the remarkably blithe assumption that “if it worked there, it will work here.” It was this sort of pseudo-historical thinking that informed much of the Bush administration’s overconfidence in its ability to turn Iraq into a Western-style democracy: “we did it after WWII.” When Iraq war supporters weren’t relying on memories of the post-WWII occupations, they allowed the experience of post-1989 eastern Europe to misinform them about what to expect after regime change in Iraq.
We saw the same sort of shoddy argument during the Libya debate, relying on the Kosovo precedent as “proof” that a “good” intervention could “work,” and the Bosnia example has been endlessly used as a crutch for the extremely bad idea of intervening in Syria. Not coincidentally, this involved exaggerating the success and ease of the earlier Balkan interventions in order to make intervention in Syria seem more appealing. To the extent that opponents of the Libyan war even talked about Iraq, it was to point out the obvious dangers of overthrowing a country’s government with no plan for what followed, but opponents of intervention in Libya didn’t need the Iraq example to make the case that destroying the Libyan government would be destabilizing and irresponsible.
The authors continue:
Parallels from the past too often are put forward less to focus debate and discussion than to shut them down.
I agree. That’s why it is instructive to pay attention to which side in these debates most often reaches for historical analogies to use as cudgels in this fashion. It is most often the proponents of “action” and “leadership” that are quickest to resort to these analogies, because they tend to be the ones most prone to making dire and alarmist warnings. Describing the present as a replay of the 1930s or 1970s is commonplace among hawks, because they are eager to portray their policy preferences as bold opposition to appeasement and/or “decline.” In general, supporters of a more restrained foreign policy don’t rely on these comparisons as often or as much to argue against specific interventions, since they are only too aware of how often the historical record has been abused in previous debates.

The American Conservative,C,The Dante Club | The American Conservative," 
Eight years ago, San Francisco teacher Callen Taylor saw a need among the students in her school:
Mission High is composed of mostly low-income, minority students, many of them new immigrants learning English. The school’s curriculum concentrates largely on modern, multicultural literature as a way to engage students in reading. While Mission students do read a couple of Shakespeare’s plays and a smattering of other classics before graduation, much of the Western canon never crosses their desks.
Callen Taylor, 30, teaches social studies at Mission and said many of her students lack “cultural currency.” They have no knowledge of Greek mythology or Renaissance artists or ancient Rome.
She was made especially aware of their gap in knowledge when they returned to Mission last fall after having participated in a variety of summer programs along with wealthier students from other schools. They told her they’d felt intimidated.
“They felt like why are all the kids smarter than us?” Taylor recalled. “Why does everybody seem to know Greek mythology? How do they know Jupiter is the same as Zeus? A lot of people would take that for granted.”
Her solution? The Dante Club.
She started a Saturday morning club in which twelve kids would get together and read through the Inferno together, and talk about the poem. Taylor got the idea after doing Bill Stephany’s and Ron Herzman’s NEH-sponsored summer program in Siena, in which a select group of high school teachers learn how to make Dante come alive for their students. You can apply for the 2015 program here – and as someone who has both been to Siena and benefited massively from Herzman’s teaching on Dante via the Great Courses, I cannot encourage you strongly enough to do so. Anyway, this is what happened when Callen Taylor came home from Siena:
She returned to Mission to learn her students had felt ill prepared for their summer programs and believed the Dante Club could give them more confidence. She suggested they all meet the next weekend — Labor Day weekend — to start reading Dante. And they all showed up and haven’t turned back.
“It’s a hard poem, and I can’t believe they come. Every weekend, I’m shocked that they come and want to read it. And they like it!” Taylor said. “It gives them confidence academically and when they get that, they want more.”
She said they’ve especially seized on the idea of fate, which plays prominently in Dante’s work.
“They like that idea — is it fate or do we have control in our life?” Taylor said. “For kids in poverty, it seems like a lot of their life is up to someone else.”
The kids told the San Francisco Chronicle reporter that reading Dante had changed their lives. Readers of the newspaper collected money to send these impoverished kids to Italy, on the Dante trail, and off they went. So now, eight years later,  the reporter has done a follow-up piece to see what happened to the club members. It turns out that nearly all of them have done well — and they credit their teacher and Dante for paving the pathway to success.
The highlight of the Dante Club came when the group traveled to Rome, Florence and Siena together on a two-week adventure. Most of the kids had never traveled beyond their initial moves to San Francisco. They marveled at the Sistine Chapel, the statue of David and the rabid Italian fans watching the World Cup.
“That was the best experience of, like, my life,” Jimenez said. “It was crazy. To me, it was amazing.”
Lim said she thinks often about the trip to Italy and that the art museums were her favorite part. She said that without Taylor’s “guidance and perseverance,” she and the other Dante Club members never would have read the masterpiece or taken the “once-in-a-lifetime journey.”
“This club provided me a different perspective and outlook on life,” she said. “Who would have thought that a few inner city students would learn so much from the work of Dante Alighieri?”
This week and next, I am in a time of extremely intense writing, revising my Dante manuscript. I’m writing it in part for readers like these kids, and for teachers like Callen Taylor. If posting is light here in the next few days, know that I’m not wasting time.

The American Conservative,C,Federalism Can Still Save Religious Liberty | The American Conservative,"We live in a post-Christian America, broods the insightful “natural pessimist” on morality and religion, Rod Dreher, writing two long pieces on his The American Conservative blog that feature theologian Peter Leithart coming to this dramatic conclusion about government and Christianity in America today:
We’ve fooled ourselves for decades into believing that Christian America was derailed recently and by a small elite. It’s tough medicine to realize that principles inimical to traditional Christian morals are now deeply embedded in our laws, institutions and culture. The only America that actually exists is one in which “marriage” includes same-sex couples and women have a Constitutional right to kill their babies. To be faithful, Christian witness must be witness against America.
Specifically, Leithart had predicted beforehand that “Tax exemption will be challenged, and so will accreditation for Christian colleges and schools that hold to traditional views of marriage. Once opposition to same-sex marriage is judged discriminatory, no institution that opposes it will be unaffected.” He justified his pessimism by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissent in Windsor:
In the majority’s judgment, any resistance to its holding is beyond the pale of reasoned disagreement. To question its high-handed invalidation of a presumptively valid statute is to act (the majority is sure) with the purpose to “disparage,” ”injure,” “degrade,” ”demean,” and “humiliate” our fellow human beings, our fellow citizens, who are homosexual. All that, simply for supporting an Act that did no more than codify an aspect of marriage that had been unquestioned in our society for most of its existence—indeed, had been unquestioned in virtually all societies for virtually all of human history. It is one thing for a society to elect change; it is another for a court of law to impose change by adjudging those who oppose it hostes humani generis, enemies of the human race.
Dreher concluded with an even darker insight, from Catholic Cardinal Francis George:
I am (correctly) quoted as saying that I expected to die in bed, my successor will die in prison and his successor will die a martyr in the public square. What is omitted from the reports is a final phrase I added about the bishop who follows a possibly martyred bishop: “His successor will pick up the shards of a ruined society and slowly help rebuild civilization, as the church has done so often in human history.”
Dreher bases his grim view from the passion on the matter exercised by the other side of the debate. He recalled that Maggie Gallagher had reported on a 2006 Becket Fund conference about the now EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum who, raised as an Orthodox Jew, was open enough to attend the symposium with the goal of showing gay respect for religion. Yet, it turned out to be a limited type of respect.
To Feldblum the emerging conflicts between free exercise of religion and sexual liberty are real: “When we pass a law that says you may not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, we are burdening those who have an alternative moral assessment of gay men and lesbians.” Most of the time, the need to protect the dignity of gay people will justify burdening religious belief, she argues. But that does not make it right to pretend these burdens do not exist in the first place, or that the religious people the law is burdening don’t matter.
Feldblum believes this sincerely and with passion, and clearly (as she reminds me) against the vast majority of opinion of her own community. And yet when push comes to shove, when religious liberty and sexual liberty conflict, she admits, “I’m having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.”
And it appears that public opinion is now on the side of the gay community. Case closed.
Is America really on the verge of a civil war in which Christians replay the early persecutions? Actually, the most recent Pew survey finds only a plurality of 49 percent in the U.S. support gay marriage but also that 51 percent still think such marriages are sinful. Gays may have won the marriage law but they still lack the legitimacy they demand. The public is split down the middle on whether caterers and florists who have religious objections should be able to refuse services to gays. As far as political elites, region and urbanization play big roles. California has required churches to purchase insurance that includes abortions. Oregon required bakers to supply gay marriage ceremonies. Washington state sued to require a florist to garnish for a gay marriage. Catholic dioceses in Washington D.C. and Boston have left adoption services because forced to refer children to gay couples against church policy. The city of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho demanded married, ordained Christian ministers running a wedding chapel, marry gays. The New England Association of Schools and Colleges threatened to revoke their accreditation of Massachusetts’ evangelical Gordon College if it did not change its policy on homosexuals.
This division reflects that of U.S. politics and culture generally: left and right coasts verses middle America, blue verses red states, sophisticates verses rednecks, religious against secularists, conservatives against liberals. The difference is that power has shifted radically left through the Ivy League elite-dominated Supreme and lower federal courts. But does this mean civil strife? Leithart recommends that discriminated-against Christians witness peacefully even at the cost of reputation, economic opportunity and income or even more serious repression. James Davidson Hunter has long recommended shunning politics and especially national policy and going local to reconnect with Jesus and community. Are the catacombs, then, the only remedy for traditionalists determined to follow their faith as courts take decision-making from local control?
Fortunately, federalism is not that brittle. While granting national appeal courts a strong hand against the states on gay marriage, the most recent Supreme Court decision actually turned the matter back to the states for administrative disposition. National courts have limited ability to write their own marriage laws and even with their oversight there is much room for state action to limit the damage as traditionalists await future changes in the complexion of federal courts and law-making.
Before the Supreme Court ruled, 24 states more-or-less voluntarily adopted or accepted same sex marriage. That means remedies are potentially available in the other 26 states to consider legislative remedies to preserve, in some manner or another, marriage between one man and one woman as a unique relationship. The fact that Republicans now control two-thirds of state legislative bodies makes this possible. At least some gay marriage supporters—for example law professor James G. Dwyer–recognize there is a sufficient state interest to pass federal judicial rational-basis review in treating traditional marriage distinctively based upon the unique biological composition of such unions in producing children and perhaps even because children may benefit more under such relationships.
State regulation of marriage itself could remain minimal as at present, being basically a contract between the couple being married. Only with children and the possibility of their abuse, or in separation or divorce is state regulation of marriage per se common. Marriage could even be a purely private or religious contract without government controls other than offering an alternative state contract for those who might prefer one and for all of them being enforceable in state courts. Divorce and separation options could be specified in the original contract, perhaps with limited additional state oversight. When children are involved, the law could distinguish between different child situations: most sections of traditional state child protection law could be re-organized under the title of biological family law and new titles added for adoption and artificial insemination for other child custody originations, which clearly present different issues. Rational differences could be deduced and the state interest in each identified, including any empirical benefits to children under different relationships.
Significant privatization is essential for marriage and social policy generally if force and severe civil conflict are to be avoided. Justice Anthony Kennedy’s main concern was to provide equal material benefits to homosexuals as granted to heterosexual couples under Federal laws. That can easily be achieved by granting all welfare benefits to individuals, to children through whoever has legal custody. As far as anti-discrimination laws, these were adopted as an extreme means to combat the extreme evils of slavery and legal segregation. Over time, new aggrieved groups demanded equal remedy for less cause. Applying such laws to sexual preferences and religious disagreements on morality would be momentous. The European religious wars of the past are not appealing futures and make no mistake, a secular demand for moral equality is a religious claim under a different label. One need only look to the Middle East to see what we should want to avoid. Any real reform of marriage must take place freely in what future pope Joseph Ratzinger then called an attitude of “non-conformity” toward the dictates of current fashion.
Conditions change. Christian marriage did not even require clerical witnesses for its first millennium. The state did not control marriage in Britain until 1754 or in France until the Revolution, before America broke free of both.  Catholic marriages were not recognized in the United Kingdom until 1836. Meanwhile, American federalism provided the means for cooling things off. It managed tensions well enough to take extremely diverse colonies, from Puritan New England, to Anglican Virginia, to Quaker Pennsylvania, to Catholic Maryland, to mixes of these and others throughout the colonies and early states finally developing into a nation by allowing each to develop independently and freely. It failed in 1860 with a civil war but slowly a rose again to a reasonably peaceful, just and prosperous America in modern times.
The U.S. is divided once again by strong views on social policy and wisdom suggests the solution once again is regional diversity, federalism, and a live-and-let-live culture. Without them, Dreher, Leithart, and George might just be proven prophetic.

The American Conservative,C,Why the Dishonest Charge of “Retreat” Endures | The American Conservative,"Michael Cohen reacts with disbelief to Bret Stephens’ book, America in Retreat:
How can anyone make an argument like that? After all, the evidence that America is not in retreat and has not forsaken a role of global engagement during the Obama presidency is so obvious it is barely worthy of discussion. 
Cohen and I have both made the observation before that there has not been any U.S. “retreat” from the world. It is worth debating whether there should be significant changes in U.S. foreign policy, including the withdrawal of some U.S. forces deployed in Europe, the Gulf, Asia, but the fact of the matter is that nothing like this has happened or was ever likely to happen under Obama. The charge of “retreat” (or “disengagement” in its milder form) is specious and blatantly dishonest, but it continues to be made because it is a useful line of attack for hawks to make against any form of internationalism that isn’t as aggressive as theirs. 
Like other bogus claims in foreign policy debate (e.g., “isolationism”), the charge of “retreat” is useful precisely because it is misleading and false. First, it puts the target of the accusation on the defensive and distracts attention from the horrible foreign policy views of the person flinging the accusation. Refuting garbage accusations eats up time and energy that might be more productively used in some other way. Casting their opponents as advocates of “retreat” helps hard-liners to pretend to be the only real internationalists in the debate, and it lets them set the terms of the debate so that anything short of their preferred policies can be equated as “retrenchment.” That helps hard-liners to drag the debate in their direction by constantly redefining what policies constitute “retreat” and which are consistent with U.S. “leadership.” Conveniently, their opponents are always supporters of “retreat” no matter what the opponents’ policies happen to be. Obama can conduct a foreign policy that is at least as objectively hawkish and aggressive as any modern president of the last forty years, and he can still be pinned with the “retreat” and “neo-isolationist” labels because he hasn’t done as much as the hard-liners want him to do. In truth, much of Obama’s foreign policy record is appallingly bad, but that is because it has frequently been in line with the kinds of policies that hard-liners support. That is another reason why hard-liners are so eager to portray the Obama record as a “retreat”: it allows them to disavow the consequences of the administration’s failed interventionist policies that they favored.

The American Conservative,C,Against the Mob | The American Conservative,"Let me make my position clear: I don’t know whether Jackie was raped at a University of Virginia fraternity house. It might have happened. There is an investigation underway now, as there should be. Ari Schulman points out that there is still reason to believe that Jackie is telling the truth, and that Richard Bradley’s celebrated debunking of the Rolling Stone story has problems of its own. This is important to keep in mind. As Ari says, we don’t fight confirmation bias from one side with confirmation bias from the other.
What was very wrong, though, was for Rolling Stone magazine to run a blockbuster story that takes the position that the rape actually happened, when these facts have not been established. Hanna Rosin and Alison Benedikt at Slate write:

Erdely is a very accomplished magazine writer. She has written about many difficult subjects before, including an OB-GYN who was convicted of fondling his patients. (She didn’t talk to him either, but she did include a sentence saying he could not be reached for comment. Plus, he had already been convicted.) She must know the basic rules of reporting a story like this: You try very, very hard to reach anyone you’re accusing of something. You use any method you can think of, including the jerk reporter move of making a surprise, in-person confrontation. (Sarah Koenig, the host of the Serial podcast, provides a good example of reporter due diligence.) You try especially hard if you are writing about something as serious as a gang rape accusation. Sometimes, what results is a more layered version of the truth. Sometimes, the answer you get makes the accused seem even guiltier (e.g., Bill Cosby, asserting through a lawyer, that all the dozens of accusations against him are “fabricated”).


If you fail to reach the person, you write a sentence explaining that you tried—and explaining how you tried—as a way to assure your readers that you gave the person a chance to defend themselves. We’re not sure why Rolling Stone didn’t think that was necessary.

This is Journalism 101. And then, whether they realize it or not, Rosin and Benedikt answer their own question:
We found Jackie and she agreed to talk to us. Then, at the last minute she backed out. She had already been interviewed by the Washington Post for a story that has not yet run, and she had picked up that the media had some doubts—something that she is understandably sensitive to. What became clear from talking to Jackie’s supporters at UVA is that the community of victim advocates operates by a very specific code. “The first thing as a friend we must say is, ‘I believe you and I am here to listen,’ ” says Brian Head, president of UVA’s all-male sexual assault peer education group One in Four. Head and others believe that questioning a victim is a form of betrayal, because it will make her feel judged and all the more reluctant to ever speak about what happened. None of the people we spoke to had asked Jackie who the men were, and in fact none of them had any idea. They did not press her on any details about the incident.
See how this works? Sensitivity to the alleged victim of a violent crime is commendable. But to take that sensitivity to the point where her viewpoint is exclusively privileged simply because of her claimed status as a crime victim is dangerous, because it sets the stage for potential injustice. If Jackie’s story was fabricated, then an unspeakable injustice has been done to the Phi Psi fraternity, the Greek system at the University of Virginia, and to the University of Virginia itself. How will they get their reputations back?
I’m not letting myself off the hook here. As I said yesterday, I believed the Rolling Stone story when I first read it, and consciously pushed aside doubts I had about the reporting — specifically the obvious fact that Jackie is the only source for what supposedly happened that night, and the fact that the reporter didn’t have as much as a “No comment” from any of the alleged rapists. Why? Partly, I think, because of a lingering bias against fraternities, the legacy of my long-ago college days. Mostly, though, because my years of writing about the Catholic sex abuse scandal has powerfully biased me towards believing victims who accuse powerful institutions of covering up sexual violence to protect the image of the institution.
This is wrong. It is one thing to have observed that institutions tend to behave a certain way. It is another to believe without sufficient evidence that an institution and the people within in behaved that way, because hey, that’s what people like that do. If you think you are above doing this, you are lying to yourself. As embarrassed as I am to be confronted with evidence that I chose to ignore red flags in this story because it fit a narrative that made sense to me, I am glad of it, because it reminds me how fallible human judgment is.
The writer Caitlin Flanagan, who wrote a hard-hitting Atlantic story about fraternities and rape, told Slate that if Jackie’s story turns out to be false, “it is going to cause so much trouble in the area of reforming fraternity sexual assault, I can’t even tell you.” Similarly, the more campaigners hold on to Michael Brown and Ferguson as a symbol of police brutality and racism, the less willing many others are going to be to take a real problem seriously.
It is all too easy to forget that real people stand to be really hurt by false accusations, especially when a system set up to adjudicate them is biased towards one side or the other. As minorities and the poor know all too well, the deck has historically been stacked against them in court. I know of at least two specific cases from where I live, in the Deep South, from back in the 1930s and 1940s, in which black men were killed by powerful white men, who never had to answer for it in court. In one case, a mob called by the sheriff lynched a black man for raping a white woman. It emerged afterward that the two had been lovers, but had been caught, and the woman accused the man of rape to save her own skin. Of course the sheriff believed her. They knew that a white woman would never willingly have sex with a black man. There was no need for a trial (and if there had been a trial, rape was not a capital offense); the sheriff got a mob together and they strung the black man up. Days later, the woman’s conscience broke, and she confessed that they had been lovers.
Nobody ever answered in court for the extrajudicial murder of that black man. It would have been unthinkable back then. Black lives didn’t matter.
Now, think about what the UVA student Brian Head said to Slate:
Head and others believe that questioning a [rape] victim is a form of betrayal, because it will make her feel judged and all the more reluctant to ever speak about what happened.
The sheriff and his mob didn’t question the supposed rape victim in that case. She was white, her alleged rapist was black. What more did you need to know? And look what happened.
Is this really the mentality we want to encourage?
It is impossible to guarantee justice in this life. None of us can fully overcome our biases; we are human beings, not machines. But we are required to work hard to do so, and to put in place procedures that keep us from going off the rails because of our own biases. Giving any person the privilege of being believed simply because of their race, gender, sexuality, social status, or any such thing that has nothing to do with their character, is to lay the groundwork for injustice.
One of the reasons I am a conservative is a deep distrust of the mob and its passions. There is something so sweetly intoxicating about losing yourself in the crowd, and being carried along with it, especially if you believe your cause is righteous. The crowd becomes a mob when it loses control of itself, and cannot be stopped until it has its release, sometimes through a scapegoat. Caiaphas helped incite the mob to scapegoat Jesus, saying, “You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”
This is what we are up against when the mob decides that the pursuit of truth in a case is secondary to vindicating what we might call the mythological truth. That is, it is better for one fraternity to die than that the cause of stopping sexual violence on campus perish. Or: it is better for one undergraduate woman to be raped than the reputation of the university and its fraternities perish. It is better for one Ferguson cop’s freedom to be sacrificed than that the cause of fighting police racism and brutality perish. Or: it is better for one black guy to die than public confidence in law enforcement fighting perish.
Civilization is only possible through the submission of the passions to reason. Civilization is not possible when the mob rules. Mobs aren’t just rioters on the street. They can be crusading journalists in a newsroom, or campus professors and activists. Any time you have a group of people who are willing to sacrifice others, and the truth, for the sake of vindicating a myth or cause dear to them, you have a mob.
Because all of us are capable of that, all of us are potential members of a mob. If you want to stop mob rule, confront it first in your own heart and mind.

The American Conservative,C,Eric Garner & Police Brutality | The American Conservative," 
Yes, the Staten Island grand jury saw and heard a lot more evidence about the police killing of Eric Garner than any of us did. Maybe their decision not to indict was justified. Maybe. But based on the video of the incident, I can’t imagine how. It was brutal, their takedown of Garner. That cop killed helped to kill Eric Garner with that chokehold, which is forbidden by the NYPD. Then his colleagues dogpiled Garner, even after he said he couldn’t breathe. How can a grand jury not even see this as worthy of a trial? There is not even a question of the cops’ lives being in danger from Garner, as there was in the Mike Brown killing.
This is deeply, deeply disturbing. The grand jury proceedings had better be released. I’m trying to be fair about this, knowing that the grand jury had access to weeks of testimony that none of us do, but the video is damning. I don’t blame people at all for protesting this (though God, please let them be peaceful).
Here is what Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore had to say about it. Excerpt:
“I’m stunned speechless by this news. We hear a lot about the rule of law—and rightly so. But a government that can choke a man to death on video for selling cigarettes is not a government living up to a biblical definition of justice or any recognizable definition of justice. We may not agree in this country on every particular case and situation, but it’s high time we start listening to our African American brothers and sisters in this country when they tell us they are experiencing a problem.
“For those of us in Christ, we need to recognize that when one part of the Body of Christ hurts, the whole Body of Christ hurts. It’s time for us in Christian churches to not just talk about the gospel but live out the gospel by tearing down these dividing walls not only by learning and listening to one another but also by standing up and speaking out for one another.”
Maybe, just maybe, a trial would have found these cops not guilty of negligent homicide in Garner’s death. But based on that video, how can there not even be a trial? This is messed up.
UPDATE: Reader Bobby, who is a lawyer, writes:
I watched the video, and I’m not sure what those favoring indictment are seeing. To proceed with an indictment, there has to be some evidence of criminal intent. That’s true even for criminally negligent homicide. I don’t see anything in the video to suggest that the officers did what they did with criminal intent.
Like the Darren Wilson case, this is a case for the civil courts, not the criminal courts. And I think that’s what these grand juries ultimately decided.
UPDATE.2: More wisdom from Bobby:
We all make mistakes at work. The difference is that most of us aren’t called upon to carry out our jobs in life-and-death situations. These police officers, all of whom were smaller than the perpetrator, were called upon to arrest a large, belligerent, man who was resisting arrest. Moreover, he had spent the previous 1-2 minutes lying to the police officer, which doesn’t give his much credibility when he later protests about his alleged breathing problems.
Moreover, I think we have to take into account the expectations we place on police. As white-collar professionals take up residence in the city, we expect police to create an environment that makes us feel as safe as we’d feel on the streets of Rye or Harrison. We expect police to make sure that we don’t have to encounter annoying nuisances like Garner during our walks to work. But we want them to do it in a way that’s neat and clean, and that doesn’t expose the messiness of the racism that’s implicit in what we’re asking them to do.
I was recently riding the train in Chicago. After an annoying black man was escorted off the train by police, I overheard a young woman say the following.
“I don’t understand why they’re still here. We don’t have low-skill manufacturing jobs for them anymore. If they’re not going to conform to societal expectations, it’s simply time for them to go back home to Mississippi. It’s much easier to be poor and have no skills in the country and in a warmer climate.”
We’ve long since stopped trying to address the problems of urban poverty. The goal now is to contain it and to isolate it to a few neighborhoods that lie far from places where respectable people go. And whether we admit it or not, we’re not simply asking police to keep us safe; we’re also asking them to make sure that the refugees remain invisible when they step outside of their refugee camps.
UPDATE.3: Reader Polichinello, quoting from Bobby’s post, then chiming in with a  remark of his own:
I don’t understand why they’re still here. We don’t have low-skill manufacturing jobs for them anymore. If they’re not going to conform to societal expectations, it’s simply time for them to go back home to Mississippi.
LOL.
Thus we have the SWPL master plan for their hipsterburgs. Cleanse their metropolises of blacks, and if the rubes in places like Ferguson protest all the new Section 8 neighbors showing up with their social pathologies, call them racist.

The American Conservative,C,Ferguson Is Not Palestine | The American Conservative,"In the morning e-mail came something from the activist group CODEPINK, headlined “From Ferguson to Palestine, Come Out to Join Us.” Listed were various events: a vigil for Michael Brown at the Justice Department, a meeting of “fighters for social justice” at a popular Washington cafe the following evening, similar events in that vein. Also on the list was a talk by professor Richard Falk, formerly UN special rapporteur on Palestine, to discuss Israel’s latest land grab around Jerusalem.
CODEPINK is not alone in seeking to connect Ferguson to Palestine: pro-footballer Reggie Bush tweeted something about it over the weekend, and Annie Robbins of the important Mondoweiss website publicized the Bush tweet. Then there’s this: a post by a board member of the right-wing Zionist group StandWithUs, connecting anti-Palestinian Israelis with the Ferguson police, both holding the line of civilization against peoples full of rage and an unjustified sense of their own victimhood. There was some Twitter pushback against the StandWithUs post, and the Times of Israel eventually removed it. The pro-Palestinian website Electronic Intifada portrayed this as some sort a victory, rather as if the Palestinians had won the right to possess Ferguson as “their” symbol. Rania Khalek writes that “Zionist organizations are rattled by the growing displays of solidarity between people in Ferguson, Missouri, and Palestine.” While it’s true that such such displays are growing, I doubt seriously that any Zionist organizations are rattled by them. If they have any political savvy, and they surely do, they would instead welcome it—as did the StandWithUs board member.
Why? Well, for starters, Palestine really is occupied, and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have no political and civil rights, and those who reside in Israel proper are now being told that Israel can take away their citizenship at any time.
Ferguson, by contrast, is a complicated situation. The one simple thing about it is the fact that if Michael Brown hadn’t leaned into a police cruiser in order to assault a police officer and to try to seize his gun, he would be alive today. As always there is a broader social and historical context: a considerable amount of police brutality directed at blacks, exemplified by episodes like this, on top of many layers of American history in which blacks were enslaved, and after emancipation, subject to fierce legal and customary discrimination. I largely agree with John McWhorter, who asserts that throughout America there are large segments of the black community who consider the police morally bankrupt, and that this is a huge national problem. It is certainly a problem with no easy answer. There wasn’t one in the 1960s when finding a decent, family-sustaining job was achievable for most people willing to work regular hours, and it is no easier now in an economy far far more geared to rewarding the very rich, highly skilled, or very talented, while the working class has lost ground steadily for 40 years.
The thing about Palestine, however, is that it is actually not that complicated. Resolving the issue in a fair and practical way is of course difficult. But it has long been an article of faith among pro-Palestinian activists that if Americans could see the land-grabbing, see the checkpoints Palestinians are subjected to, see the difficulty of trying as a student to commute through roadblocks and checkpoints to Bethlehem University from Ramallah, they would understand that Palestinians are subject to a blatantly unjust and racist regime, facing conditions no American would put up with for a moment without resisting. And they would see that this Israeli regime—heavily subsidized by American tax dollars—is animated by ideologies sharply at odds with American values, at least with how those values have evolved over the past 50 to 100 years. Perhaps Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians resembles South Africa under apartheid, perhaps it resembles the American South of the pre-civil rights era; perhaps it is worse than both. It does not, in any way, shape, or form, resemble Ferguson, Missouri, where all American-born blacks possess the same constitutional and civil rights as white Americans.
To the extent that the American left succeeds in creating an impression of some sort of rhetorical and moral equivalence between Ferguson and Palestine, describing both venues as places where a virtuous, oppressed people confronts brutal and murderous white racism, they will harm the prospects of Palestinian struggles ever being considered sympathetically by a critical majority of Americans. For the fact is, the more Americans learn about Ferguson, the less sympathy Michael Brown and his cause receives. The young man surely should not have been shot to death—Officer Darren Wilson probably blundered in a dangerous and chaotic situation. But to hold Brown blameless is something that most Americans won’t do.
Before the grand jury decision was announced, a Huffington Post YouGov poll indicated that only 22 percent of whites thought that Officer Wilson was culpable, versus 64 percent of blacks. After the release of the the grand jury report, after Ferguson residents showed their displeasure by widespread looting and burning, after mainstream news shows showed the Brown family lawyer getting decimated in on-air debates about the facts in the case, after Michael Brown’s stepfather mounted a podium to tell Ferguson residents to “burn the bitch down,” the poll numbers are not going to shift more in favor of the racist whites versus innocent blacks narrative. That the United States is so divided racially, on this issue and others, is, of course a national problem. But it is surely not one which Palestinian activists should seek to exploit by linking their cause to the losing side.
In all of this, of course, are echoes of the American 1960s. The activism of that decade began with a movement of civil rights activists, white and black, risking their lives to secure for blacks in the South their fundamental constitutional rights. It expanded with opposition to the Vietnam war. It reached a crisis point when liberalism, the dominant ideology of the age, had to confront the reality of black rioting in northern cities, demonstrating how complex the racial issue was, how difficult it would be resolve it. Part of the Left soon embraced the idea that any black demand, any black behavior, was justified. Some New Left theorists advanced the notion that ghetto blacks were a revolutionary vanguard in the mother country. “Off the Pigs, Power to the People” did, really, become a New Left slogan. (“Pigs” was the common epithet for police officers. “Off” meant kill.) Black Panther chic advanced to the salons of the Upper East Side. It wasn’t especially obvious to everyone at the time, but these were sign posts that the movement had imploded, had driven itself mad, and was so committed to hating “whitey” that it was on the road to becoming essentially irrelevant to any serious politics in America.
There are more than a few whiffs of that era in the current Michael Brown madness. Most Palestinian activists realize that if they could win for their people in historic Palestine the rights possessed by each and every black citizen of Ferguson they would have gained a victory of world-historic proportions. Nevertheless one can understand the temptation of connecting to a movement in America that does at this moment seem energetic and hip, which seems to be treated with enormous deference and respect in the dominant media, and which must seem for all the world like an unstoppable emergent groundswell. Added to this is the important if seldom-noted fact that black members of Congress have, on average, been far more ready than their white colleagues to see the need for justice in Palestine, and have been more willing to question and challenge the self-righteousness behind America’s blind and often murderous policies in the Mideast. The connections emerging from those sentiments should, of course, be welcomed and nurtured.
Ferguson however is a bridge too far. Nothing could please the Likud coalition more than to see the Palestinian cause linked, in the minds of the average, mainstream American, to that of the Ferguson rioters. For the pro-Palestinian left to work to reinforce exactly that linkage will be seen as dreadful mistake, for which Palestinians will surely pay a higher price than American leftists will.

The American Conservative,C,"Chris Rocks, Chris Rolls | The American Conservative","There will be something to irritate almost everyone in this Frank Rich interview with Chris Rock, but you know what? There are some real gems here too. I love that Chris Rock. Excerpts:
What do you make of the attempt to bar Bill Maher from speaking at Berkeley for his riff on Muslims?
Well, I love Bill, but I stopped playing colleges, and the reason is because they’re way too conservative.
In their political views?
Not in their political views — not like they’re voting Republican — but in their social views and their willingness not to offend anybody. Kids raised on a culture of “We’re not going to keep score in the game because we don’t want anybody to lose.” Or just ignoring race to a fault. You can’t say “the black kid over there.” No, it’s “the guy with the red shoes.” You can’t even be offensive on your way to being inoffensive.
When did you start to notice this?
About eight years ago. Probably a couple of tours ago. It was just like, This is not as much fun as it used to be. I remember talking to George Carlin before he died and him saying the exact same thing.
More:
Before Obama arrived, you were saying that there’d been Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, and then black leaders in America became like substitute teachers.
I mean, you got to realize, there’s not a need for it the way there was. Back then, we needed that guy for our day-to-day existence. Now you only feel the need in special cases. So, okay, Ferguson goes down. You’re like, Oh, it’d be great if we had a guy.
When Al Sharpton goes down to Ferguson, it feels like a media ritual rather than an actual civil-rights action.
It’s a revival, where King was doing an original play. It’s a good part. The lead is open.
One more:
Where else besides Ferguson would you hypothetically want to interview white people?
I’d love to do some liberal places, because you can be in the most liberal places and there’s no black people.
I assume one such place is Hollywood.
I don’t think I’ve had any meetings with black film execs. Maybe one. It is what it is. As I told Bill Murray, Lost in Translation is a black movie: That’s what it feels like to be black and rich. Not in the sense that people are being mean to you. Bill Murray’s in Tokyo, and it’s just weird. He seems kind of isolated. He’s always around Japanese people. Look at me right now.
We’re sitting on the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking Central Park.
And there’s only really one black person here who’s not working. Bill Murray in Lost in Translation is what Bryant Gumbel experiences every day. Or Al Roker. Rich black guys. It’s a little off.
Whole thing here.

The American Conservative,C,The Greatly Overrated Rubio | The American Conservative,"Josh Kraushaar touts Rubio as the Republican front-runner:
The leading contender for the GOP’s presidential nomination is polling at a measly 3 percent in two new national surveys testing Republican primary candidates. He wasn’t even included in Bloomberg’s November poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters. He’s been overshadowed by the media’s obsession with brand-name candidates, like Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, even though his profile is more compelling than either.
Kraushaar can claim that Rubio is “the leading contender” for the nomination if he wants, but there doesn’t seem to be much to support that. As Scott Conroy points out this week, it isn’t at all certain that Rubio will even seek the nomination. For my part, I have guessed that Rubio won’t run at all and will focus on his re-election bid. Conroy also notes that “the buzz that Rubio has generated the last few years has not resonated much outside of his home state.” Rubio already lost some of the early support that he had enjoyed when he was being prematurely built up as the answer to the GOP’s woes. Many politicians temporarily benefit from speculation about their aspirations for higher office, and Rubio was no different. Rubio’s problem is that his boomlet happened two years ago, and political journalists and pundits have mostly moved on to look at other potential candidates.
The case for Rubio may seem strong at first glance, but makes no sense under closer scrutiny. For instance, take Kraushaar’s first claim that Rubio “can win support from both the establishment wing of the party and tea-party activists.” That may have seemed true when he was first elected, and it might have been true two years ago, but I don’t think it holds up today. Now many of the activists that originally supported him feel that he betrayed them on immigration, and many “establishment” Republicans don’t need Rubio when they have other candidates that will give them what they want. Rubio’s anemic polling in early states can’t really be explained by lack of name recognition. It is more likely that his old supporters lost interest in him as they learned what he did in office.
So it is a remarkable stretch to say that he is the “most electable” Republican in the 2016 field when he is in single digits nationally and in early primary states. Even in Florida, he averages 13% support. Rubio has won exactly one statewide race in his career, and that was an odd three-way contest in an exceptionally Republican years. Assuming that Rubio is “most electable” because of his biography makes even less sense. Most Hispanics aren’t going to be interested in voting for a conservative Cuban-American, and young voters aren’t likely to be impressed by a foreign policy hard-liner in his forties. A “child of the 1970s” whose thinking and arguments are still mostly stuck in the 1980s will have little or nothing of interest to say to the generations that came of age since then.
Kraushaar places a lot of emphasis on Rubio’s “background” in foreign policy, but for all practical purposes his background is not noticeably more extensive than that of other first-term senators that have also shown an interest in the subject. It’s true that Rubio has spent a lot of time talking about foreign policy issues, and he clearly wants to be known for his hawkish views (while disavowing the label and baggage associated with it), but that doesn’t make him that much more qualified than most of the other possible 2016 candidates. While Rubio may be comfortable talking about foreign policy, he isn’t likely to appeal to anyone except other hard-liners. His record as a vocal advocate for new military interventions is more likely to be off-putting to many of the “somewhat conservative” voters that often decide primary winners. Hawkishness by itself won’t be a liability for him among Republican voters, but he has pigeonholed himself as one of the most consistently aggressive hawks in the Senate. Despite support specifically for the war against ISIS, the public still doesn’t have any desire for a foreign policy as aggressive as Rubio prefers.

The American Conservative,C,Ukraine and NATO | The American Conservative,"Christoph Schult criticizes NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg for commenting on possible Ukrainian membership in NATO:
And herein lies the problem: Only a small minority — comprised primarily of the Baltic states and Poland — currently support Ukrainian accession to the alliance. All others adhere to the principle that each accession should not only be beneficial to the new member, but also to the community as a whole. It’s difficult to see at the moment how Ukraine might benefit NATO.
In that sense, there is only one right answer in response to Poroshenko’s musings. It’s the one formulated by German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. “I see a partner relationship between Ukraine and NATO, but not membership,” the foreign minister told SPIEGEL ONLINE last week.
Or, to put it more simply, the question of Ukrainian membership isn’t even on the agenda.
Indeed, NATO would be better off if it explicitly ruled out the possibility of future Ukrainian membership and laid this issue to rest once and for all. The optimal time to have done that was several years ago when Ukraine affirmed that it would not join any military alliance, but instead the alliance insisted on “keeping the door open” to Ukraine. Since the new government has changed Ukraine’s position on alliance membership once again, it is up to the alliance to dispel any illusions about the country’s prospects of joining. Merely stating the obvious–that most NATO members don’t want Ukraine in the alliance and Ukraine won’t be permitted to join–could help reduce tensions with Russia and could possibly make a political settlement between Ukraine and Russia easier to reach. Ukraine isn’t ever going to be part of NATO because it would be a huge liability for the alliance, and it is long past time for U.S. and alliance officials to make that clear.

The American Conservative,C,A Chuck Hagel Postmortem | The American Conservative,"As a follow-up to my discussion with Stephen Walt, I wanted to say a few more words about Chuck Hagel’s tenure as Secretary of Defense.
When Hagel was originally hired, I questioned the consensus that his nomination signaled a shift to a more restrained foreign policy:
It’s pleasant to think that the President actually wants Hagel’s advice, but that strikes me as somewhat unlikely. First of all, the President, by all reports, takes most of his advice from a very close circle. Though Obama got a favorable impression of him in his brief time in the Senate, Hagel isn’t in that circle. Second, what’s Hagel going to offer advice about? Handling the DoD? Hagel has expressed an interest in trimming the fat at Defense – but that’s very different from seeming like the sort of person who would be effective at out-maneuvering vested interests who will oppose that trimming. Handling Iran? Hagel’s shown a real interest in an approach that emphasizes the desire for normal relations over one that assumes a confrontational posture is the only realistic option, but that’s not the same thing as saying that he has any particular regional expertise. Handling Congress? Was Hagel a notably effective Senator?
Another possibility is, as noted, that the President wanted to make a point – to signal that he was interested in a less-confrontational foreign policy, and in modestly reducing military spending. But if he wanted to send a signal, why send it tentatively?
Meanwhile, the opposite interpretation is also possible: that the President wanted someone like Hagel to endorse whatever his policies already are. . . . And a third possibility is that President Obama didn’t think that carefully about the symbolism of the choice, but thought of Hagel simply as “a Republican I can work with” that would earn bi-partisan points for bringing him in. That would have been foolish of him, but you know, discounting the possibility of incompetence is rarely wise in evaluating what goes on in Washington.
I concluded as follows:
[T]he real question is whether Hagel would be effective at managing the Pentagon. I don’t have any particular insight on that question, but it’s not obvious to me that Hagel fits that particular bill. The last Secretary of Defense I can recall who muscled material reductions in military spending was a fellow named Dick Cheney. And look what he turned into after 9-11. So you really never can tell.
Now, in the wake of Hagel’s departure, we’re getting news stories like this one, claiming that Hagel was largely kept out of the loop of decision making (which we already knew), but also that Hagel was hardly the advocate of foreign policy restraint that his boosters might have assumed, specifically advocating a firmer line on Russia than the Administration was willing to take. That doesn’t surprise me too much, as Hagel was also responsible for over-hyping the threat posed by the Islamic State before the White House had settled on a response.
To be fair, the heart of Hagel’s criticism, as articulating in that WSJ story, is that the U.S. has not been sufficiently clear in its policies, that we’ve lurched from strong statements to weak actions – which is, I would agree, a very fair criticism – and that we don’t have an overall strategy. Hagel correctly understood that the Administration approach of asserting American centrality in every conflict while being very cautious about actually committing resources was causing foreign observers to question America’s true level of commitment. But he wasn’t willing to advocate either a more outright hawkish approach to these conflicts, or an outright more restrained policy that took American intervention off the table. He didn’t want to oust Assad but he wanted to be “clearer” about our goals in Syria. He wanted to de-escalate tensions with Russia but he wanted to do more to rein in Putin and reassure our European allies. He thought we needed to consider “creative” options but “he didn’t advocate a position different than the ones Mr. Obama was pursuing.”
Hagel was frustrated by the indecision and lack of strategic thinking at the highest level. But he was similarly indecisive and had no particularly noteworthy strategic insights to add. He became a vehicle for expressing the dissatisfactions of the Pentagon with the President rather than someone who could successfully bridge the growing gap between the President and the Pentagon. None of which surprises me at all – it’s entirely in keeping with the impression I formed of Hagel when he was a Senator.
The challenge for advocates of a more restrained foreign policy remains the same as it has been for a generation now since the end of the Cold War. We either have to accommodate the rise of other powers by bringing our own policies more into line with their interests, which might facilitate working in concert to maintain order internationally – or we have to accommodate the rise of other powers by actively withdrawing from areas in which they have greater interests than we do, effectively giving up on the idea of concerted maintenance of international order in favor of something more closely resembling a spheres-of-influence approach.
But neither alternative is particularly popular. We – both the foreign policy establishment and, if we are honest, the American people – seem prefer lurching between trying to maintain hegemony on the cheap, and trying to maintain it more expensively. Both Hagel and Obama have done their share of lurching. We should assume that the next two years will feature more of the same, regardless of who Hagel’s successor is.

The American Conservative,C,Iran: We Need to Talk | The American Conservative,"Nuclear negotiations with Iran have been extended, but the incoming Republican Senate majority isn’t enthusiastic about them.
“We’re definitely getting played by the Iranians,” says Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, a leading proponent of sanctions.
“Extending talks with Iran won’t achieve the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free Iran,” concurs Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
The negotiations have been “much waste of time,” according to another conservative observer, since “the chief negotiator was not to be trusted.”
Actually, this last quote comes from a hard-line Iranian newspaper. Despite the well-worn talking point that diplomacy plays into the hands of the ayatollahs and the mullahs, Iranian hard-liners are as skeptical of talking as John McCain.
“You cannot trust the Great Satan,” the Iranian army deputy chief of staff has been quoted as saying. “The Great Satan promises but does not deliver.”
Diplomacy will be deeply unsatisfying for American policymakers expecting zero uranium enrichment or Iranians who want zero Western sanctions. But support for this course doesn’t require any undue faith in either Tehran’s intentions or the Obama administration’s competence.
After the Iraq War, invading and occupying Iran to shut down any nuclear program is out. Our viable options beyond blithely accepting Iranian assurances it is not building a bomb are limited.
The West can work to prevent an Iranian bomb through aggressive and intrusive international inspections. Or we can hope some combination of bombing and sanctions will either persuade Tehran to abandon any nuclear ambitions or cause the Iranian people to overthrow their government.
Senate hawks argue that bombing Iranian nuclear sites could set the nuclear program back further than the interim deal. But few argue U.S. or Israeli strikes could end it permanently.
Bombing would not only delay Iranian nukes at a greater human cost, it would risk rallying young, reformist segments of the population behind the ayatollahs. It would harden Iranian support for the nuclear program not just as a matter of national pride but as a guarantee of the government’s survival.
Over time, our intelligence about where the nuclear sites are would deteriorate relative to what we would learn through inspections. And the idea that sanctions and bombings will produce a pro-American response from the Iranian populace simply flies in the face of human nature.
A sanctions regime without strong international support may make Senate cosponsors feel good about themselves, but it won’t do much to influence Iranian behavior. Just ask the Cubans, whose communist tyranny has outlived the Soviet Union by a quarter-century, about the embargo.
Is an Iranian nuclear deal guaranteed to work? No. Senate Republicans point to the failure of the 1994 pact with North Korea, negotiated by the Clinton administration with the help of Jimmy Carter (making it a perfect symbol of disaster for conservatives) as an example of what could go wrong.
But this example also illustrates the limits of the more hawkish alternatives. Absent some unacceptable level of aggression by North Korea, who really counsels war as the solution?
The Republican congressional majorities of the 1990s didn’t like the North Korean framework either. But the actual policies they were free to contemplate fell short of their rhetoric about overthrowing a rogue regime.
Many Republicans sense that their options aren’t much better with Iran today. That’s why a joint letter from the incoming Republican senators, whose foreign-policy views are on average more Tom Cotton than Rand Paul, asks for “comprehensive inspections of suspected nuclear development sites” and is silent on military force.
Inspections are not perfect, but their track record is preferable to other options.
After more than a decade of U.S. war in the region, is Iran weaker or stronger? How about militants like the Islamic State or jihadists in post-regime-change Libya? Does international law prevail, or the law of unintended consequences?
To ask these questions is to answer them. Perhaps this time it is better to jaw-jaw than to war-war.
It may be possible to avoid both an Iranian bomb and war with Iran. It’s certainly possible to end up with both a war and a bomb.

The American Conservative,C,COIN Is a Proven Failure | The American Conservative,"In late October MSNBC’s Ronan Farrow asked retired Army Lt. Col. John Nagl to give viewers a deeper understanding of the fight between the Islamic State (ISIS) and Kurdish fighters around Kobane. Widely credited with “writing the book” on successful counterinsurgency (COIN) operations, Mr. Nagl said, “we’ve got 1,500 guys on the ground, but they’re not as far forward as they need to be to make a real, immediate impact on the battlefield.” He and a number of COIN experts argue that along with 15,000 U.S. ground troops, Iraqi, Kurdish, and Syrian rebel soldiers can defeat ISIS. Before making any decisions, American leaders should first consider this: despite what is often claimed by a host of advocates, the COIN theories upon which these recommendations are based were in fact demonstrable failures in both Afghanistan and Iraq. We must not sacrifice any more American lives and harm American interests any further by acting on theories that are likely to fail again.
It has been taken as an “obvious truth” by many Americans and major media outlets that the counterinsurgency strategy brought to Iraq by former general David Petraeus in 2007 turned a near-certain defeat into an historic victory. There were two key fundamentals from which many believe victory sprang. The first was that American troops needed to leave U.S. bases and “live in the neighborhoods” with Iraqi citizens, the second that a surge of troops would give Baghdad “breathing space” to form an inclusive government. Instead of leading to success, however, these twin pillars may have contributed to the failure.
In a study published earlier this year by the National Defense University, authors Sterling Jensen and former Iraqi general Najim al-Jabouri wrote this of the Americans’ effectiveness in Anbar province cities: “[t]he surge did not have a role in the Anbar Awakening. Surge troops that came to Anbar in 2007 were not seen as useful… In fact, U.S. troops in general were not seen as useful even before the surge…”
But the authors’ possibly most pointed finding was that the causal factor behind the eventual drop in violence had little to do with either the increase in U.S. troops or the new strategy: “If not for al Qaeda’s murder and intimidation campaign on Sunnis, and its tactic of creating a sectarian war, the Anbar Awakening—a fundamental factor in the success of the 2007 surge—most probably would not have occurred, and it would have been difficult for the United States in 2006 to convince Sunnis to partner with them in a fight against al Qaeda…”
The Sunni-initiated Anbar Awakening, followed by the Petraeus-led “Sons of Iraq” program, resulted in a dramatic drop in violence. The breathing space purchased with considerable American blood was intended to facilitate the development of Iraqi democracy. Kelley Vlahos, contributing editor for The American Conservative, recently wrote, “in hindsight, the only meaningful space created was for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki” to use America to rid him of political enemies, not the least of which were many Iraqi Sunni leaders and groups.
Maliki’s oppressive rule, which alienated much of the Sunni population in the Western part of the country, was a key factor in the rise of ISIS; his penchant to dismiss Sunni officers and pack the senior ranks of the Iraqi Security Force (ISF) with inexperienced political patrons played a major role in the disintegration of the ISF when the Islamic State began its offensive.
I served in Iraq as a military trainer in 2009, and have twice deployed to Afghanistan (2005, 2010-11). Between my 2009 Iraq deployment and the last Afghanistan deployment—at the height of that surge—I traveled over 14,000 miles throughout both countries, going on mounted and dismounted patrols, with U.S., allied, Iraqi, and Afghan troops, and led a team to train an Iraqi border battalion. I can conclusively state that outside the wire, the counterinsurgency theories were an unqualified failure at the strategic level. The populations were never protected in either country. The insurgent forces were never fully defeated in either country—and are stronger now than they have been at any time since 9/11. The Afghan and Iraqi governments remain the third and seventh most corrupt governments in the world, and do not have the support of their people. The armed forces for both countries, despite the decade-long effort and tens of billions of dollars that the U.S. spent training them, are virtually incapable of conducting even basic security.
It is incomprehensible that with such an extensive, publicly available record of failure—which cost the United States $2 trillion in direct outlays, 6,842 U.S. troops killed and 52,281 wounded in action—that the designers of this failed concept are given any credibility. The conclusive evidence of the failure is on graphic display right now, in both countries: after six full years and tens of billions spent, the U.S.-trained Iraqi army melted away before a few thousand irregular fighters; after the U.S. pulled out of Helmand province in Afghanistan, the Afghan National Security Forces were incapable of preventing an immediate return of the Taliban.
As the president’s national security team continues to develop a new strategy to deal with ISIS—and now also searches for a new secretary of defense—it is more important than ever to make a no-holds-barred analysis of the past decade of combat experience before settling on a new strategy. No matter how many U.S. boots might be placed on the ground in Iraq or Syria in this current environment, they would not be able to accomplish the president’s previously stated objectives. All the additional causalities we would suffer would be in vain.
We must not send any more Americans into the morass of Iraq and Syria with as little concern as one might show shoveling coal into a furnace. They deserve better than to be asked to risk their lives to conduct a no-win tactical mission.

The American Conservative,C,Considering Thankfulness | The American Conservative,"“I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought; and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.”
― G.K. Chesterton
Thanksgiving: it’s an idea given concrete embodiment, a virtue that’s taken the form of turkey and gravy, football and 5K’s. It’s easy to get distracted from the actual “thanksgiving” in our Thanksgivings, by bloated stomachs and Black Friday shopping, touchdown passes and pumpkin pie.
But this national celebration of thanks is perhaps one of the most vital opportunities we possess to ponder the meaning of thankfulness: why it matters, and what it ought to look like in our everyday lives. It’s an opportunity for all of us—regardless of whether we go around the table sharing trite “what I’m thankful for” speeches—to consider what thanksgiving really is, and what we are really thankful for.
Many, when pondering things they’re thankful for, will consider circumstantial comforts: food on their tables, a roof over their heads, the comfort of friends and spouses. All of these things are good, and worth being thankful for.
But as our world aches with protests and wars, death and poverty—with decay and grief of a million sorts—it is important for us to express a different, a deeper sort of thankfulness. Because if all we have to be thankful for is our circumstances, then next Thanksgiving may not be so bright and cheery. If all we have to be thankful for are our circumstances, then “Thanksgiving” becomes a feast of forgetfulness, a blasé masquerade. Because sometimes our circumstances are terrible. There are riots in Ferguson, violent protests over injustices and death. There are Christians fleeing for their lives in the Middle East, looking for shelter, desperate for protection. There are people in slavery, forced to work in brick kilns or brothels, desperate for freedom. There are countless families experiencing divorce, estrangement, separation, or alienating bitterness. Many of us feel the aching pain of death and loss this holiday season—there is an empty seat at our Thanksgiving table.
The original Thanksgiving wasn’t all rainbows and butterflies, either. There were 50 Plimouth Plantation settlers at the first Thanksgiving—they were all who remained of the original 100 settlers. Their travels to the U.S. had resulted in death and hardship.
It is difficult—even painful—to be thankful, at times. And yet we still celebrate Thanksgiving. Why?
We must not come to the Thanksgiving table lightly, being foolishly indifferent or Pollyanna-ish about “what we’re thankful for,” leaving all our annoyances and griefs and pains outside in the cold. We must acknowledge their presence, the ache they represent in our lives. But we must also look past the decay and death, to the grace and mystery beneath. We must remember the gifts that thread through our existence, tinging everything with joy.
We must see life as a gift: as something precious, something we could never have earned or deserved. Each moment we spend in community is a tremendous grace.
We must see this world as a gift, in all its beauty and goodness, in all its tragedies. It is breathtaking, mysterious, beautiful.
We must see love as a gift—every warm heart, every loving marriage and caring friendship, every beloved family member or moment of camaraderie. We must not take kith and kin for granted.
Thanksgiving, thus, is about more than a list of circumstantial pleasures: it is also about incomprehensible mystery. It’s about the fact that, despite our cares and pains, we have been given more than we could have ever asked for. We have received more than we could have ever deserved. It is a mysterious grace. Life isn’t perfect—but it is good, all the same.
♦♦♦
“Gratitude sanctifies the world. Gratitude makes the world holy. Nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thankfulness, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.
Think about that. Think of everything you possess, everything that is yours in life. How can we live with these things in a way that doesn’t entangle us? In a way that isn’t sinful?
Receive them as gifts. When we handle the things of the world as gifts they become holy, consecrated and sanctified. Gratitude—thankfulness—marks the boundary between the sacred and the profane.”
— Richard Beck, “The World is Made Holy Through Thanks”
“It has seemed to me sometimes as though the Lord breathes on this poor gray ember of Creation and it turns to radiance – for a moment or a year or the span of a life… Wherever you turn your eyes the world can shine like transfiguration. You don’t have to bring a thing to it except a little willingness to see. Only, who could have the courage to see it?”
— Gilead, Marilynne Robinson
In The Brothers Karamazov, a priest tells the story of his brother, who died as a little boy. One day, his mother finds the little boy crying. When she asks him what is wrong, he responds,
“‘There was such a glory of God all around me; birds, trees, meadows, sky, only I lived in shame and dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.’
‘You take too many sins on yourself,’ mother used to say, weeping.
‘Mother, darling, it’s for joy, not for grief I am crying,’ he replied. ‘Though I can’t explain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for I don’t know how to love them enough.’”

The American Conservative,C,Star Wars and Politics | The American Conservative,"Dan Drezner worries about how the next Star Wars film will address political themes:
The new trailer suggests that the Imperial forces have not exactly disappeared, which means that the politics here probably will be about a Rebel Alliance facing growth pains as it tries to actually govern. Although the political scientist in me is intrigued by that narrative possibility , the sci-fi geek in me is petrified that these questions will bore the hell out of me while I’m watching — or, worse, enrage me, like Anakin Skywalker’s political pontificating.
I should say first that I expect the upcoming Star Wars to suffer from all the many flaws that marred Abrams’ disaster of a second Star Trek film, not least of which was the very forced attempt to make the story “relevant” to contemporary debates about terrorism, drones, and related issues. I agree with Seth Masket that it is possible for a movie to address these themes successfully, but I have absolutely no confidence that Abrams knows how to do that. More generally, attempting to make a piece of pop culture “relevant” to contemporary politics can easily lead to the gross oversimplification of difficult problems, and a tentpole space opera is the wrong place to try doing these things anyway. A post-Empire Star Wars story could ideally have some interesting things to say about the inevitable disorder and upheaval that comes from the violent overthrow of an authoritarian state or the weaknesses and flaws of a very young democratic order that tries to replace it. Unfortunately, the amount of exposition needed to tell that part of the story would make any movie very long or very dull or both. So to the extent that Abrams chooses to indulge in making political arguments in these movies, I assume that they will be just as clumsy and heavy-handed as they were in Into Darkness.

The American Conservative,C,Thanksgiving Doorbusters Backfire on Big Retail | The American Conservative,"This Thanksgiving, Wal-Mart opened at 6 pm, as did Macy’s, Target, Kohl’s, Sears, Belk, and Sports Authority. Dick’s Sporting Goods opened at 5, along with Best Buy, Toys R Us, and JCPenney.
Many decried the invasion of Thanksgiving Day itself by the teeming hordes of Black Friday doorbuster deals, and some even called for boycotts of stores that tore employees from their families on what was declared to be “a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens.” But few, I would suspect, held high hopes that their efforts could even slow the unleashed passions of American consumerism as retailers competed to chip away at Thanksgiving’s protected status year after year.
This year, however, something funny happened: sales slumped.
Industry group the National Retail Federation had been predicting strong growth for this kickoff to the holiday shopping seasons, but reported yesterday that sales from the entire Thanksgiving weekend, Thursday through Sunday, fell by 11 percent, while the number of shoppers venturing out over the weekend fell by 5 percent. According to the New York Times, “Executives at the retail federation … appeared at a loss to fully explain the drop-off.” Some pointed to early sales, others to the possibility that the recession still lingers. At the same time, they argued that significantly lower fuel prices and a strengthened economy kept people from being reduced to scrapping for bargains.
Perhaps the numbers are simply an inexplicable blip. But at least for now, we may have a concrete data point of possible hope in the seemingly doomed struggle against commerce’s march upon our culture.
Brandon McGinley wrote that expressed concerns about Black Friday consumerism was “in fact classist condescension” as “Many upper-middle class Americans simply cannot comprehend that Black Friday might be the only day when one can afford a modest luxury.” One gets the sense from his article that he sees cohorts of blue-blooded WASPs condescending to the great unwashed masses who venture out to snap up discounts. And there surely were some WASPish blue-bloods who so condescended.
But the numbers generally do not bear out the idea that opposition to consumerism is a classist exercise. According to the National Retail Federation, people with incomes over $50,000 (roughly the national median) were in fact more likely to shop over the weekend than those with incomes below that mark, 60 percent to 50 percent. And the breakdown of when consumers first braved the retailing crowds shows the two sides of America to be virtually indistinguishable. And while I grant that a more granular breakdown of the data could tease out more differences, I would not be surprised to see the general trend hold.
Let’s hope that this year’s numbers spook the big retailers, and makes the prospect of extending, or even continuing, the hours that they must pay time-and-a-half to their entire workforce too risky a proposition. For in the rhythm of national life, we should be able to take one day away from our normal pattern of purchasing in order that all but the most essential workers may gather with family and offer “Thanksgiving and Praise.” The retail worker, which is the most common occupation in every one of the fifty states, should not be broken from that national rhythm simply because capitalism’s actors find themselves incapable of refraining from eating away at those institutions upon which capitalism depends.
As I wrote after last Christmas,
The true costs of consumerism may not come from the seeking of happiness in material goods. That is a story as old as time, and most of us come to grips with its emptiness at one point or another. Instead, it may be the impressing of the whole world into the service of our desires and convenience, reducing the people we rely on to a mere means of our satisfaction.
For at least a day, let’s hold out hope that consumerism overextended itself, and finally found a point of exhaustion from which we can begin even the smallest of recoveries. Happy Advent.

The American Conservative,C,"And Now, For Something Completely Different – Or Perhaps Not | The American Conservative","Before tackling more serious subjects today (like my absurd backlog of theater write-ups), I wanted to briefly touch on Damon Linker’s latest column, about how “traditional religion” would adapt to the discovery of intelligent extraterrestrial life. In Linker’s view: not well.
Just as the scientific Copernican Revolution destabilized and downgraded humanity’s place in the cosmos by substituting heliocentrism for a geocentric view that placed the Earth and its inhabitants at the center of creation, so the discovery of advanced life on other planets would imply that human beings are just one of any number of intelligent creatures in the universe. And that, in turn, would seem to imply either that God created many equally special beings throughout the universe, or that God cares for us more than he does for those other intelligent beings. How the latter view could be rendered compatible with basic tenets of monotheism (including divine omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence) is beyond me. Did God create those other intelligent creatures, too, but without an interest in revealing himself to them? Or did they, unlike human beings, evolve all on their own without divine origins and guidance? . . . But I have an equally hard time accepting that believers would be capable of wrapping their heads around the possibility that God loves all intelligent creatures on all planets equally. Does God send Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed to visit other worlds to deliver the same moral and theological revelations? Or does he raise up analogous prophets — and in the case of Christianity, incarnate himself in extraterrestrial species — in order to spread his message to everyone throughout the universe who is capable of receiving it? I suspect that these puzzles are so corrosive in their skeptical implications that contact with intelligent life from other worlds would produce a rapid collapse of faith rooted in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran, with a rapid spread of atheistic secularism in their place.
I love topics like this, because they don’t matter at all – and, because they don’t matter at all, they may reveal hidden assumptions more effectively than subjects that actually do matter. In this case: assumptions about what makes religions tick, what drives their success or failure. Linker assumes, implicitly, that unpleasant or unexpected facts are a profound threat to traditional religion. But the evidence for this is surprisingly limited. Let’s begin with the non-Abrahamic religious traditions: Hinduism, Buddhism, traditional Chinese religion, African animist beliefs, etc. It’s not clear that the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe would pose any kind of challenge to these traditions. Indeed, the bulk of scientific discoveries about human origins and development are more readily compatible with these traditions than they are with Judaism, Christianity or Islam. You would think, therefore, that the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions would have already put the wind in the sails of these non-Abrahamic traditions, and hobbled the growth of Christianity and Islam. But precisely the opposite has been the case: both Christianity and Islam have continued to spread, and make converts across Asia and Africa. Next: let’s look at what Christianity specifically has already assimilated or resisted successfully. It has, as noted, survived overwhelming scientific evidence that humanity was not created immaculately in its current form, but arose through the process of evolution by natural selection – i.e., by surviving in a brutal contest for survival with other species. It has also survived the transition from a heliocentric worldview to one in which the Earth is an almost invisibly small speck in the corner of a galaxy that is itself only a tiny part of an incomprehensibly vast universe. But before that, it survived three more profound challenges:

The encounter with America. Linker thinks it would be devastating to Christianity to reckon with the reality of intelligent beings that either never experienced God’s love through revelation and incarnation, or who experienced those things through a separate revelation and/or incarnation. But Christianity had to reckon with that reality five hundred years ago. And it’s still here.
The rise of Islam. Which is a more troubling fact for Christianity: the possibility that the biblical account of creation is profoundly inaccurate, or the possibility that another religion has the true revelation? Well, when Islam swept over the Christian holy land, and went on to conquer much of the known world, Christians were faced with that question. Christianity has still not really formulated a coherent theological response to the rise of Islam, at least not in my view. But Christianity has survived and thrived despite that failure.
The death of Jesus of Nazareth. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Christianity is founded on the prima facie absurd notion that when your leader and hoped-for messiah is captured, tortured, and executed, that this is good news. It is a religion founded on the complete failure of normal, rational expectations, and consequently a complete revaluation of the meaning of plain facts. That’s what Christianity was at its origins. And we’re supposed to believe that this religion wouldn’t be able to handle a few little green men?

Now, I’m not going to argue that any of the above “proves” that Christianity would have no trouble surviving an encounter with extraterrestrial life. But I do think it proves that we can make no easy assumptions about what might or might not pose an insurmountable challenge to any particular religious tradition. Religions do not grow and shrink in response to reasoned analysis. Their origins are mysterious and their subsequent trajectories are the function of too many variables to be easily teased out. Why did Mohammed’s conquests lead to the formation of a new world religion, while Genghis Khan’s did not? Why did Jesus beat out Mithra in the contest to succeed Roman paganism? Why was there any such contest in the first place? What, for that matter, do the Abrahamic religions offer that is so appealing that they continue to grow at the expense of non-Abrahamic traditions that, objectively speaking, require much less of a leap of faith, much less suspension of disbelief in the objectively absurd? I don’t know the answer to these questions. But they have more bearing on the prospective future of Christianity – and what that future will look like – than the possibility that Christianity will seem absurd in the face of this or that scientific development. Even so revolutionary a development as the encounter with extraterrestrial intelligence. UPDATE: For those of you unfamiliar with the book that the image above is taken from, here it is.

The American Conservative,C,Cotton and the Iran Hawks’ Loathing of Diplomacy | The American Conservative,"Incoming Republican Senator Tom Cotton is refreshingly candid about his hostility to diplomacy with Iran:
I hope that Congress’ role will be to put an end to these negotiations.
Specifically, he wants Congress to violate the terms of the interim agreement so that the U.S. will be the party responsible for the breakdown in talks. Despite the fact that Iran has so far complied with the terms of the interim agreement, Cotton wants the U.S. to ignore its commitments. It’s worth noting here that hawks are never concerned about lost “credibility” when it comes to violating international agreements. Ending the negotiations would free Iran from the constraints of the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA), which has so far succeeded in making it more difficult for Iran to build a nuclear weapon in the future than if there had been no interim agreement. 
Cotton claims that Iran is “getting everything it wants,” but that is far from true. When the extension of talks was announced last month, Paul Pillar explained why the U.S. benefited the most:
Our side—the United States and its partners in the P5+1—got by far the better side of the deal in the JPOA. We got the fundamental bomb-preventing restrictions (including most significantly a complete elimination of medium-level uranium enrichment) and enhanced inspections we sought, in return for only minor sanctions relief to Iran that leaves all the major banking and oil sanctions in place. If negotiations were to go on forever under these terms, we would have no cause to complain to the Iranians.
Cotton is a typical Iran hawk in that he is intensely opposed to the diplomatic effort that has already made a nuclear-armed Iran less likely. His objection to the negotiations doesn’t seem to be based on the details of the current agreement, but stems instead from a reflexive rejection of diplomatic engagement with unsavory regimes. Like most hard-liners, Cotton simply asserts that the other side is getting the best of the deal because this is what hard-liners normally assume about any negotiation. The greatest danger for a hard-liner on Iran is the possibility that a final agreement could be reached that satisfies all parties and shows that successful diplomacy with Iran is possible, so it is understandable that hard-liners are prepared to do what they can to sabotage negotiations.

The American Conservative,C,Jeb Bush’s Victory Plan | The American Conservative,"Jeb Bush outlines a curious political strategy:
Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida was blunt Monday night: If he runs for president in 2016, he will not pander to his party’s conservative base in the primaries.
Mr. Bush said at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council in Washington that Republican candidates must be willing to “lose the primary to win the general [bold mine-DL], without violating your principles.”
This suggests that Bush has forgotten something that his brother learned during his first campaign. When George W. Bush started his campaign, he initially ran against the Congressional GOP and presented himself as a relative moderate, the so-called “reformer with results.” Many Republicans thought this to be a clever imitation of Clinton’s “New Democrat” pitch at the time, but once Bush faced some semi-serious competition from McCain he quickly figured out that he needed to rally conservative voters. So Bush set out to make conservatives believe that he was one of them. Thanks in no small part to McCain and conservative voters’ dislike for him, Bush was successful in this, and unfortunately for all of us many conservatives’ identification with Bush persisted for a long time. To some extent, his father had done the same thing in 1988 by presenting himself as Reagan’s heir. Bushes can certainly win the Republican nomination, but they have to do it by getting primary voters to forget that they are Bushes.
Now Jeb Bush is describing a campaign that would mimic the early part of his brother’s first run without any attempt to replicate the later, more successful part. The problem with this isn’t that a relative moderate can’t win the Republican nomination. In fact, it is rarely the case that the relative moderate hasn’t won. Jeb Bush’s mistake here is in thinking that a candidate can run what the article calls “an unapologetically pragmatic bid” and still prevail. Most conservative voters are used to being taken for granted during the general election, and they’re usually willing to play along provided that they think that the nominee shares their priorities. However, the would-be nominee has to convince them first that he is mostly on their side on major issues. If Jeb Bush thinks there are a lot of Republican voters hungering for bland “centrism” with a dynastic name attached to it, he is in for an unpleasant surprise.

The American Conservative,C,Declaring War on ISIS | The American Conservative,"Emma Roller reports on Rand Paul’s proposed declaration of war against ISIS:
And by introducing what would be the first declaration of war to come out of Congress since World War II, Paul is backing up the claim he’s been trying to prove over the past six months: that he is a “conservative realist” who is skeptical, but not afraid of intervention.
If the war against ISIS is going to continue, it is better that Congress authorize it or, in this case, formally declare war, but I do find it a bit strange to view this and other similar proposals in Congress as a meaningful check on the president. The administration has made clear that it doesn’t think it needs Congress’ approval to wage the war against ISIS, and it isn’t going to respect any Congressional action that doesn’t approve of what the president decided to do months ago. An authorization or declaration at this point would do little more than endorse a war that will continue no matter what Congress does or doesn’t do.
Setting a one-year expiration on such a declaration makes sense, since that would require Congress to reconsider its support, but who thinks that the administration would end hostilities if Congress chose not to reauthorize the war? It would deny that it needed Congress’ approval in the first place, but would cite the first vote in favor of authorization as justification enough to continue the war for as long as it wanted. In the event that Congress voted against authorizing force or declaring war, the war would not stop unless the ‘no’ voters were also prepared to deprive the war of funds, which is even less likely to happen than a ‘no’ vote. It is right for Paul’s proposal to mostly rule out ground forces in combat, but again what is going to stop the administration from ignoring this restriction in practice if it deems it appropriate?
Put bluntly, it isn’t much of a reassertion of Congressional authority or responsibility to acquiesce to a war illegally launched by the president. Even if this is done through a formal declaration of war, it is still a matter of signing off on a war that the president already started by himself. As a matter of policy, a declaration of war commits those voting ‘yes’ to support an ill-conceived and unnecessary military operation. Passing such a measure would confirm that presidents can start wars illegally and that they will then have their illegal decisions endorsed by Congress after the fact. If there is to be a vote on the war against ISIS, Congress should vote no.

Slate,L,Uber raises $1.2 billion: New funding gives Travis Kalanick's ride service a $40 billion valuation.,"Remember Uber's past several weeks? They were ugly. A senior executive was caught discussing plans to conduct opposition research on journalists. Uber's top manager in New York was investigated and disciplined for privacy violations. Almost overnight, all of its data-privacy policies were questioned. With its vast collection of ride logs and team of apparently hapless executives, Uber is seeming less like a sleek taxi alternative and more like a hot target for a disastrous data breach. On top of all that, its marketing claims about the great money drivers earn are looking thin.


But forget all that. Uber's investors just gave it another $1.2 billion.


    Advertisement




Uber is now valued at an astonishing $40 billion after closing a funding round that brings its total financing to about $2.7 billion. In a post on Uber's blog, chief executive Travis Kalanick said the new funds will help fuel Uber's expansion in the Asia Pacific region. Uber, a five-year-old startup, currently operates in more than 250 cities and 50 countries and has grown six-fold in the past year alone. ""This kind of continued growth requires investment,"" Kalanick wrote. The company has also authorized a sale of $600 million more in stock, according to a Thursday filing.


The latest $1.2 billion round comes just six months after Uber said it had raised $1.2 billion from investors including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Google Ventures that valued it at $17 billion. At the time, Will Oremus spelled out in Slate the various cases for why Uber may or may not have been worth that staggering sum. While Uber's new valuation is more than double the old, the basic points are the same:


1. The optimistic analysis: Uber is not just replacing the taxi industry. It's going after the different—and much, much bigger—market for public transportation. In the vague and distant future, Uber rides could become so cheap that they replace car ownership entirely. And if the self-driving car ever becomes a reality, Uber could be positioned to serve as the dominant or exclusive provider of those trips.


2. The skeptical analysis: Uber so far has made its fortune by barging into markets heedless of local laws and regulations. Should it ever come under serious scrutiny from regulators, its operations could take a devastating hit. Uber also has plenty of competitors, and the barriers to entry for the ride-sharing business are low. Neither Uber's drivers nor its riders have any particular loyalty to the company. If a better service comes along, they won't hesitate to switch.


Based on the past few weeks, Uber's management issues would also seem to be a strike against it. As I outlined in late November, Uber's sprawling, largely decentralized structure has at times helped to empower rash and immature actors. Until very recently, Uber has also failed to scale its communications team along with its rapidly expanding business. A good portion of its missteps in the past year can be traced to that disconnect, and many have called for the company to grow up.


On the other hand, Uber just weathered arguably its worst PR disaster ever—and came out $1.2 billion richer! Emil Michael, the executive who made the ""oppo research"" comments, is still in his job, as is New York City's Josh Mohrer, the subject of Uber's internal investigation into privacy violations.


In his blog post, Kalanick nodded to the company's latest blunders. ""The events of the recent weeks have shown us that we also need to invest in internal growth and change,"" he wrote. ""Fortunately, taking swift action is where Uber shines, and we will be making changes in the months ahead. Done right, it will lead to a smarter and more humble company that sets new standards in data privacy, gives back more to the cities we serve, and defines and refines our company culture effectively.""


It would be fascinating to know just how many of those changes Uber had to detail for investors before they forked over an additional $1.2 billion. The optimistic answer to that is a lot. The pessimistic one is none at all. Blunders and privacy violations and controversies aside, Silicon Valley might just think that Uber is a shining investment opportunity with a tremendous amount of upside (if also a serious amount of risk). And good luck letting ethics find a place in that discussion.

Slate,L,Warren Buffett Ready for Hillary donation: Gives maximum to Clinton super PAC.,"Two months ago, Warren Buffett told attendees at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit that he was putting his money on Hillary Clinton. ""Hillary is going to win,"" the Oracle of Omaha told Carol Loomis onstage. ""I will bet money on it.""

Based on a new report in Bloomberg Politics, we now know that Buffett wasn't joking. The famed investor wrote a check for $25,000 to Ready for Hillary last quarter—the biggest donation allowed for an individual. According to Bloomberg Politics, the donation is also the first Buffett has ever made to a super PAC:


The contribution marks a major shift for one of the country's most famous business leaders, who's long been known in Democratic circles as a bit of a political tightwad. Though he's given hundreds of thousands to party committees and candidates, Buffett has shunned super-political action committees and other groups that can take unlimited sums. Last cycle, he headlined fundraisers for Obama’s re-election, though he rebuffed solicitations by Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC supporting the president.

Buffett is a well-known supporter of Clinton. He backed her 2008 campaign and welcomed her to Twitter with one of his five-ever tweets when she joined in June 2013. Ready for Hillary, which has no official ties to Clinton, has reportedly raised more than $11 million and is expected to file a financial disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission by midnight on Thursday.

Slate,L,James Watson Nobel Prize auction: Medal for DNA discovery gets $4.1 million at Christie's.,"James Watson's Nobel Prize medal, awarded for his work in discovering the structure of DNA, was sold at Christie's for $4.1 million on Thursday, above the predicted price range of $2.5 to $3.5 million. Including an additional ""buyer's premium"" fee for the auction house, the total price the anonymous purchaser will pay is $4.757 million.

Watson has been criticized widely in recent years for his long history of making disparaging remarks about women and minorities; Slate's Laura Helmuth characterized him as a ""peevish bigot"" a piece on Dec. 1. He was forced to retire as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory after saying in 2007 that Africans are less intelligent than other types of people. Other recent highlights include his 2012 observation on women in science: “I think having all these women around makes it more fun for the men, but they’re probably less effective.”

The sale is believed to be the first sale of a Nobel medal by a living winner of the prize. The medal of Waton's partner Francis Crick garnered $2.27 million in a posthumous auction at Dallas-based Heritage Auctions last year. The price fetched by Crick's medal prompted Waton's decision to sell—in the pre-lot text provided to Christie's, he wrote, ""I knew I would soon auction off my 1962 Gold Nobel Medal the moment I learned that Francis Crick’s Gold Medal, May 2013, had been so sold for more than two million dollars."" Watson also told the Financial Times that he hopes to regain public attention from the sale since becoming an alienated ""unperson"" because of his controversial comments.


Before the Crick auction, the only public auction of a Nobel Prize was that of Niels Bohr's 1975 Physics medal, auctioned off by an anonymous seller for the bargain price of around $75,000; William Faulkner's 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature went unsold at auction at Sotheby's last June. 


Asked about Watson's notoriety, the international director of printed books and manuscripts for Christie's told the New York Times that ""Thomas Jefferson said some controversial things too,"" adding: ""As far as Christie’s is concerned, the monumental discovery of the double helix is what this is about.""

Slate,L,Jon Stewart on Eric Garner: The Daily Show got serious on the grand jury decision (VIDEO).,"On Wednesday, a Staten Island grand jury announced it would not indict the police officer caught on video choking Eric Garner to death in July. That night, Jon Stewart opened the Daily Show with an uncharacteristically serious speech about the decision. “If comedy is tragedy plus time, I need more fucking time,” he said, noting that the Eric Garner decision came just days after last week’s grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for the death of Michael Brown. “But I would really settle for less fucking tragedy.”

We’ve seen Stewart take on a more sober tone before—most famously in his first show after 9/11—and, once again, he’s summed up what’s on a lot of people’s minds: “We’re definitely not living in a post-racial society.”

Slate,L,"Running calculator: Introducing Slate’s marathon time predictor, a better way to calculate how fast you’ll run. ","If you’ve ever used a running calculator to pace yourself for a marathon, there’s a good chance you set yourself up for failure. As I explained in a piece earlier this year, most finish-time calculators—like this one from Runner’s World—rely on an algorithm developed by engineer and runner Peter Riegel in the 1980s. The Riegel formula is based on the idea that you slow down by a certain amount as a race gets longer, what he called the “fatigue factor.” According to Riegel, you can’t predict how fast you’ll run a marathon by doubling your time over 13.1 miles. Rather, you can get a better estimate by multiplying your half-marathon time by 2.085.

Andrew Vickers, a competitive runner and statistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was convinced that we could come up with a better formula. Back in April, we asked for your help to find out if he was right.


Nearly 2,500 Slate readers answered the call, providing real-world race data to help Vickers and his colleagues build a better calculator. We ended up with results from 929 marathons, 1,446 half-marathons, 888 10K races, and 1,293 5Ks. The average woman who submitted data to the survey (39 percent of our respondents were female) was around 34.5 years old and ran about 29 miles a week. The average man was about 37.5 years old and ran around 35 miles a week. Runners completing the survey ranged from 16-year-olds to those in their mid-70s.


    Advertisement




To devise the calculator, Vickers randomly divided the data into three groups. He developed a new marathon prediction formula using the first of those groups and tested it using data from another. He is reserving the final group to present when we publish the study in a scientific journal.


When Vickers’ group crunched the numbers, they found that the Riegel formula works well when you’re using one short race to predict your time for another short race. Your 10K time is pretty close to your 5K time multiplied by 2.085.

        requirejs([""jquery""], function($) {
            if ($(window).width() < 640) {
                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

But the Riegel formula falls apart when you move up to the marathon. A typical runner in our study with a 1:45 half-marathon time (8 minutes per mile) had a marathon time of 3:53:10 (that’s 8:54 per mile). Yet the Runner's World calculator predicts that this runner will finish in 3:38:55—15 minutes faster than the actual result. That’s an “absolutely massive” error, says Vickers. If this runner paced himself according to the Riegel prediction, he would start the race at a pace that was more than 30 seconds per mile too fast. “No wonder so many runners blow up and limp to the finish,” Vickers says.


According to the numbers in our study, a more accurate formula for predicting a marathon time is your half-marathon time multiplied by 2.19. With that formula as a starting point, Vickers and his colleagues made tweaks to reflect the other lessons they pulled from the study. As you’d expect, training volume—miles run per week in preparation of a race—had a measurable influence on marathon times. “You might run a quick 5K, but if you don’t put in the miles, your marathon is going to be on the slow side,” Vickers says. Adjusting the formula to reflect training miles improved its accuracy. Our study also found that the extent to which you slow down between two shorter races, such as a 10K and a half-marathon, also reveals how much you’re likely to slow down between a short race and a marathon. Contrary to Vickers’ expectation, though, we found that age and gender had no influence on how a runner’s pace slowed from a short to a long race.


The Slate marathon calculator uses a formula adjusted to reflect your training miles. The tool performs best when you can give us your times for two previous races of different distances, though it can also be used if you input only one previous race time.




Our formula predicts that a 1:45 half-marathoner who trains 30 to 40 miles per week will finish a marathon in 3:54:50. That’s still a little bit off from the real-world results we saw in our survey—a minute and 40 seconds slower than the actual time. But if you’re using a calculator to pace yourself, Vickers says, you’re better off leaving a little in the tank for the end, when you can make up some time, rather than going out too fast and setting yourself up for a miserable finish.


Before you try the calculator, a few words of caution. Though we found that a runner’s age didn’t affect her predicted marathon time, we also didn't have many older runners in our sample, so it’s possible our predictor doesn't work as well for runners over age 60. Predictions will also be less accurate in absolute terms for slower runners, Vickers says. That makes sense, because while few runners expecting to run a 2:45 marathon end up finishing in 2:30, it’s not uncommon for a 5-hour marathoner to run 15 minutes faster or slower than expected. “In percentage terms we do just fine with slower runners; in terms of absolute time, we do slightly worse,” Vickers says.


Finally, a race that is either very difficult (because of an especially tough course or terrible weather) or very fast (because of special conditions such as a tailwind or downhill slope) makes a bad basis for predicting your marathon time, unless that marathon will be similarly hard or fast.


So, with those caveats out of the way, scroll back to the top of the page and give our new calculator a try.

(IISSM in this context means neither the International Institute of Security and Safety Management nor the Invisible Idiocracy of Snubbing Stellar Manuscripts, but “if I say so myself.” Waldman has since deleted her tweets, but you can see them on The Daily Dot.)


She continues:


""I never complain about this shit, but there are MANY books on that notable list with reviews that were NOWHERE near as good as mine.""


""What do they mean by 'Notable?' How does a book that got a decidedly mediocre review count as ""notable"" when one with a good one doesn't?""


""Sometimes ""being a writer"" totally sucks. If it weren't for the actual writing, I think I'd go back to being a criminal defense attorney.""


""It's just so fucking demoralizing. You pour your heart into your work, you get awesome reviews, and then someone decides it's not 'notable.'""


""I mean. Why do I bother? I could write a fucking journal.""


""I'm sorry I'm being such a pussy. There are real problems in the world. I'm just going to suck it up and do something good for someone else.""


""You know what? Do me a favor. Preorder my fucking paperback to make me feel better.""


""For every preorder I'll donate $1 to http://www.scholarmatch.com . Fuck the fucking NY Times.""


Waldman, who is again no stranger to public criticism, came in for plenty of mockery. “Ayelet Waldman…has written a blog about her disgust at being left out of the new Bond cast. And that it’s not called Ayelet,” tweeted Patrick Ness. And Joanne Harris lamented in faux-solidarity: “I should have a Nobel Prize by now. And a pastel pony of my very own.” Yet the Bad Mother author doesn’t regret her outburst and has posted a defense of her behavior to Facebook. There’s something fetchingly bravura about this mix of honesty, extravagance (nine whole tweets to slam a subjective list of faves?), and diva-dom. Plus, Waldman raises an interesting point: How do the books get chosen, anyway?


“We’ve had some form of the ‘Notable Books’ [feature] for a long time,” New York Times Book Review editor Pamela Paul told me. The paper used to publish a weekly column, “And Bear In Mind,” that highlighted titles the editors believed worthy of “particular literary, topical or scholarly interest.” Then, during the tenure of Paul’s predecessor Sam Tanenhaus, the rubric was reborn as “Editor’s Choice.” At the end of each year, Paul explained, all of the volumes called out in “Editor’s Choice,” nee “And Bear In Mind,” ascend to one grand “Notable Books” roundup, like the souls of the saved rising to heaven. The list simply represents “the best books we’ve reviewed that year,” said Paul. “It’s quality. What other criteria would there be?”


I suggested a few lowlier metrics, like sales, impact, and cultural omnipresence.


“Well, we do hope that there’s some overlap between quality and newsworthiness and attention,” Paul said, “though that doesn’t have to be the case.”


Has she been following the Waldman Twitterstorm?

“Every year there are people that are unhappy that this book, that book, their book, didn’t make the list,” Paul said tactfully. “One hundred seems like an awfully big number,” but in fact the Times only has space to review 1 percent of any given annum’s published titles. Of those volumes, only a tiny fraction can appear in the December spotlight. “We’re not scraping the bottom of the barrel” with Notable Books, Paul emphasized. “There’s a huge body of work out there, and every year there are narrow misses that an editor, two editors, five editors, feel bad about leaving off.”


But, according to Paul, the real pressure comes in when Book Review staffers have to select the 10 Best Books of the year. We know that pain.

Slate,L,Ferguson grand jury investigation: A shadow trial violates the public’s right to access.,"St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch’s decision to “open up” the grand jury proceedings by including massive amounts of testimony and evidence has been decried as “highly unusual,” “deeply unfair,” and evidence that police officer Darren Wilson received “special treatment.” McCulloch’s move to include a good deal of exculpatory evidence and testimony led to a three-month, closed-door proceeding that included 70 hours of testimony, including 60 witnesses and three medical examiners. The breadth of the evidence presented to the grand jury has led many to declare that it turned the entire proceeding into something that walks and quacks an awful lot like a trial, but without many of the procedural rules that would make a trial truly fair.

This move to morph a grand jury inquiry, which is typically a short rundown of the case for the prosecution, into a trial-like parade of mountains of evidence raises serious issues about the rights of Michael Brown’s family to have a fair process for their dead son, as well as highlighting concerns about unequal treatment of different kinds of criminal defendants. But seemingly lost in this jumble of legal concerns is the fact that McCulloch’s decision to shift the truth-seeking function of a criminal trial into the secret realm of the grand jury room violated another set of constitutional rights—ours. It violated our collective public right to an open criminal justice system. And if ever there was a trial to which Americans deserved a meaningful right of access, Wilson’s trial was it. Instead, we have a post-hoc document dump.


In the 1980 case of Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, the Supreme Court declared that the press and public have a First Amendment right of access to criminal trials. In the words of Justice William Brennan, “Open trials are bulwarks of our free and democratic government: Public access to court proceedings is one of the numerous ‘checks and balances’ of our system, because ‘contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power.’ ”

This right of open trials belongs not just to the accused but to all of us. It is, the Supreme Court said in the 1986 case Press Enterprise v. Superior Court, “a shared right of the accused and the public, the common concern being the assurance of fairness.” And while those accused of crimes have a constitutional right to a “speedy and open trial,” they do not, the court has said, have a right to a private trial.



Closed trials “breed suspicion of prejudice and arbitrariness, which in turn spawns disrespect for law.”
Justice William Brennan



In discussing the history and need for open trials roughly three decades ago, it was as if the court were imagining this week’s situation in Ferguson rather specifically. The community at large has a massive stake in the criminal justice process, the court said. Whether it is to make sure an innocent person is not imprisoned or a guilty one is not allowed to walk free, “the conduct of the trial is preeminently a matter of public interest.” Think about the closed doors in Ferguson these past months as you reflect on what Chief Justice Warren Burger famously explained: “When a shocking crime occurs, a community reaction of outrage and public protest often follows. Thereafter the open processes of justice serve an important prophylactic purpose, providing an outlet for community concern, hostility, and emotion.”


The fact that 12 jurors witnessed the proceedings in St. Louis does not cure the constitutional violation. While jurors can function as surrogates for the public and a check on government misfeasance, the court affirmed in Richmond Newspapers that by impaneling a jury, the community did “not surrender its right to observe the conduct of trials” or its ability “to satisfy themselves that justice was in fact being done.” Disclosing results alone, the court declared, will not “satiate the natural community desire for ‘satisfaction,’ ” and “an unexpected outcome can cause a reaction that the system at best has failed and at worst has been corrupted.” 


While the Supreme Court has never declared a right of access to grand jury proceedings, it has held that closure of pretrial proceedings that function like trials is unconstitutional. In Press Enterprise, for example, a 41-day probable-cause hearing was closed to the press and the public. Under California law, the probable-cause hearing was designed to determine whether the defendant could stand trial for the charges, much like in a grand jury proceeding. But, the court noted, the state process allowed broad introduction of evidence, meaning that it was “often the final and most important step in the criminal proceeding” and “the sole occasion for public observation of the criminal justice system.” 


Closed trials have serious costs. Brennan told us that they “breed suspicion of prejudice and arbitrariness, which in turn spawns disrespect for law.” And Burger explained that “people in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.” Furthermore, according to Burger, the “crucial prophylactic aspects of the administration of justice cannot function in the dark; no community catharsis can occur if justice is ‘done in a corner [or] in any covert manner.’ ” Yet that is precisely what this strange shadow trial from Ferguson became. It may as well have been “done in a corner.”


That secrecy was not cured in any way by the after-the-fact document dump with which the prosecutors’ office released the materials considered by the grand jury. Certainly giving all of us access to the materials created the appearance of a wholly transparent and open process. But it seems to have had largely the effect of reinforcing people’s beliefs. Michael Brown’s supporters insist he was an unarmed kid, killed by a trigger happy white cop, and Wilson’s supporters insist he was justifiably defending himself from an animal who was poised to kill him. By dumping all of the evidence and allowing us to arrive at our own conclusions, absent any context or process or ability to judge the credibility of witnesses, we have been handed the criminal equivalent of one of those choose-your-own-adventure books, in which we can all find an interpretation that conforms to our pre-existing ideas.


In the end, we all got to bear witness not to a fair and open trial, but to parts of it that do not add up to openness, fairness, or justice. We cannot believe in the fairness of a process we cannot see, and we should not be led to believe in the fairness of a process because a prosecutor’s office asserts that we have seen all we need to.

Slate,L,We Second That Second Novel List: Marlon James’ The Book of Night Women.,"Reading a book about tragedy is not itself a moral act. Many books are written as if feeling a lot of sympathy is enough to keep the reader on the right side of history, but Marlon James doesn’t play that game. His second novel The Book of Night Women—the fourth book of five we’re naming this week to We Second That: The Slate/Whiting Second Novel List—is not a redemption narrative. Redemption is tough to find on a plantation in Jamaica in 1801. As the main character, strong-willed teenage slave Lilith, learns from killing, “blood don’t taste like wine”—and as long as there is slavery there will be blood. Page after page, in small ways and large, James made me realize how rote and well-established my emotional responses are.


 



        requirejs([""jquery""], function($) {
            if ($(window).width() < 640) {
                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

Lilith’s father is the overseer. After killing a man who tries to rape her, Lilith is taken under cover of darkness into the kitchen of the big house, sheltered by Homer, the head of the relatively privileged house slaves. Like many teenagers, Lilith lives essentially for herself, but in a culture of terror this has a harder edge. She hopes her white master will notice her beauty and raise her up above the other slaves, but when faced with abuse, she has something in her that can’t help but fight, that can’t bend too low. Lilith thinks often about the light in her and the darkness, of how she contains both, just as she contains white and black blood. Homer sees this fire in her and believes that she will help with the uprising the night women are planning, inspired by the successful Saint-Domingue rebellion led by Toussaint Louverture.


A big, masterful novel like this raises questions without answering them—it raises questions that stay raised. Reading this book, I was ashamed at the relative paucity of my historical curiosity and imagination. I once argued with my husband that we should name our son Toussaint, for example, but James’ unflinching engagement with history made me realize that I have read books on how Nazis, fascists, and communists found willing executioners, but never one on the psychology of the overseers of 400 years of slavery. This epic, beautiful, complicated, enthralling book, filled with damaged people living in the misery of a plantation, where “white man sleep with one eye open, but black man can never sleep,” raises an obvious question: Who the hell were these white people? They weren’t aberrant sadists—they constituted basically the entire white population of their communities. It’s horrible to ask this question because the odds overwhelmingly suggest that if any of us, regardless of race, had been raised by slaveholders, we would probably be able sit on our porches watching whippings and hangings while drinking lemonade.

James inspires courage of imagination, he has traversed light and darkness, he has traversed centuries, and he has traversed gender. As the title suggests, this is a book about women, each with her own path through enslavement and her own injuries. Of the six women who plan the uprising, one has been shot blind in one eye, one had her throat slit as a child and has lived as a mute, one is scarred top to toe from the deliberate sprinkling of hot coals by an overseer. Their leader has a “quilt” of scar tissue on her back from whippings and breasts branded to mangled nubs. These women hide their scars beneath scarves and bonnets and clothes. These women have been maimed, inside and out, and so this is also a book about how the indomitable human impulses toward kindness, love, friendship, family, and loyalty are warped so absolutely in a slave’s life as to make a mockery of them. It is also, surprisingly, a heartbreaking love story, of a man and woman haltingly trying, and mostly failing, to overcome their status of slave and master. 


This is a vast, deep book. Many chapters begin with the same two sentences: “Every negro walk in a circle. Take that and make of it what you will.” In trying to tell why this book should be read, I feel like I could walk in circles, to the well and back, and always my bucket would come up with a new reason. Take this book, and make of it what you will.

Slate,L,"Adam Voorhes photographs a rare collection of brains in his book, Malformed: Forgotten Brains of the Texas State Mental Hospital, with Alex Hannaford.","During previous editorial assignments at the University of Texas, Adam Voorhes had come across everything from a set of antique vacuum tubes to a collection of wood letterpress type to a bunch of robots. But no one had thought to show him the storage closet full of brains in the Animal Resources Center until 2011.



He was at the university to take a photo of a brain—“just a regular brain,” nothing special—for Scientific American. But the 100 brains he found in the closet, which were stacked two jars deep on 10-foot-wide floor-to-ceiling shelves, were far from ordinary. All, in fact, were malformed or somehow abnormal. He decided to investigate.





  This brain belonged to a patient suffering from lissencephaly, which causes smooth surfaces rather than folds on portions of the brain. A perfectly smooth brain such as this is extremely rare. Adam Voorhes

            }
        });
         

Along with journalist Alex Hannaford, Voorhes traced the history of the brains. Dating back to the 1950s, they belonged to patients from Austin State Hospital (once the Texas State Lunatic Asylum). The collection—rare for its size, age, and diversity—came to the University of Texas as a gift in 1986 (other universities, including Harvard, had tried, and failed, to secure the collection) after the hospital ran out of space to store it. It is currently being used as a teaching tool by the psychology department.

As Voorhes began photographing the collection, he strove for a “clean, graphic, slightly sterile” look, which he achieved through high-resolution, large format images. Donning respirators and heavy rubber gloves, he joined Dr. Neal Rutledge, an Austin-based neurointerventional surgeon, and Tim Schallert, a University of Texas professor, in a makeshift studio in the lab adjacent to the storage closet. For two days, they worked with the brains and Voorhes captured more than 200 images in total, many of which will be published in an upcoming book, Malformed: Forgotten Brains of the Texas State Mental Hospital, out from PowerHouse Books last month.


“I wanted to study the collection with light, try to make it as beautiful as possible, but not manipulate or misrepresent anything. I wanted to study the texture of the brains, the labels, the wax dripping down the glass, cracks and chips in the jars,” Voorhes said via email.

            }
        });
         

Some of the brains were firm and easy to handle. Others, however, were heavily damaged by cysts, Alzheimer’s, or meningitis and therefore too delicate to remove from their jars. Among the brains were rare specimens including a “smooth brain” belonging to a patient who suffered from Lissencephaly. “Many of the patients suffered from disorders that could be managed today. ... I’m surprised they passed away in a mental hospital rather than an emergency room,” he said.




Even as science journals have published new research about the brains, and the University of Texas has begun creating MRI scans of the specimens, the collection is still surrounded by mystery. According to Hannaford’s research, the collection was originally twice its current size—but nobody knows how 100 human brains disappeared from the university in the past 30 years. One of those brains belonged to Charles Whitman, who, in 1966, killed 16 people and wounded 32 others at the University of Texas at Austin.


For a while, Hannaford and Voorhes searched for microfilm containing patient records, but the effort lead to a dead end. Still, Voorhes hopes his project will inspire more investigation and secure the collection’s continued maintenance.


“I wanted to preserve the collection, if only visually,” Voorhes said. “It spurred so many questions that kept floating around in my head, most of them are still unanswered.”



  This is the brain that made Voorhes want to find the medical records of the brains. The case number was partially illegible but could be salvaged. Adam Voorhes

Megan James’ vocals overlay Corin Roddick’s tinkling, synth-filled production to slightly more anthemic effect than we heard on Shrines. But their brand of pop remains pleasantly unsettling. And the lyrics maintain an interest in the body as a metaphor: “I crept up in you and I wouldn’t let go.” Listen below.

Slate,L,"Wild, reviewed: Reese Witherspoon takes an epic hike in this adaptation of Cheryl Strayed’s memoir.","The very first thing we see Reese Witherspoon do in Wild, Jean-Marc Vallée’s adaptation of Cheryl Strayed’s best-selling memoir about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, is sit down at the edge of a steep cliff and pull off her toenail. She’s been on the trail for a few weeks at that point, hiking solo with too-tight boots and a ludicrously overstuffed pack, and her feet are in such rough shape that the blackened, bloody nail of the right big toe has to be painfully twisted off and cast into the abyss. In the process, one of those ill-fitting boots falls off the cliff as well, filling Reese-as-Cheryl with such rage that she hurls the second one down after it with a shrieked profanity.

Slate,L,Jeb Bush’s chances in 2016: Can the former Florida governor win over the Republican Party?,"Groucho Marx said that he wouldn’t want to belong to any club that would have him as a member. Jeb Bush’s future may hang on a political corollary. He would like to be the leader of a club that he doesn’t want to join. That’s the implicit message of Bush's recent statement to the Wall Street Journal about his presidential deliberations. “I kinda know how a Republican can win,” he told the paper’s Washington bureau chief, Gerald Seib, “much more uplifting, much more positive, much more willing to be practical and … to lose the primary to win the general.” Bush then mused about what a Romney presidency would have looked like and how Bush might run the place. “Here’s a problem, let’s go fix it,” he said. “Put aside, you know, the ideological differences, let’s forge consensus around, this is a problem, how do we go from point A to point B to fix it.” (No wonder 73 percent of the audience of CEOs picked Bush as their preferred nominee.)

Slate,L,Dear Prudence: Is our sexy young nanny a temptation for my husband?,"Emily Yoffe, aka Dear Prudence, is online weekly to chat live with readers. An edited transcript of the chat is below. (Sign up here to get Dear Prudence delivered to your inbox each week. Read Prudie’s Slate columns here. Send questions to Prudence at prudence@slate.com.)

Q. Hottie Helper: I recently went back to work after the birth of my second child. My husband and I have been floored by how challenging it is to have two kids and two working parents in one household. We have arranged to have a young woman live rent-free in our basement, in exchange for being our family helper. She drives the kids to preschool, cooks occasional dinners, cleans the house, etc. It’s a sweet gig for all involved, the girl is a great fit for my family, and we are happy to help her out while she goes to college. There’s a hitch. She’s incredibly sexy and dresses in a way that leaves little to the imagination: skin-tight leggings, spaghetti-strap tanks with nothing underneath. I don’t get the feeling from my husband that he even notices, but it wigs me out. Should I just acknowledge this as a non-threat and work on my own insecurities, or address her and ask her to cover up?


A: What you describe her wearing is standard for college students, and absolutely standard for someone relaxing at home. The issue is not her clothes, but that she is a gorgeous, taut young woman, and you are feeling like a less taut, overwhelmed, not-so-young woman. I’m assuming your husband actually has noticed, but he’s a gentleman and has learned how to keep his eyeballs in his head. You, too, have to keep your head screwed on right. This is about you, not her, and not your husband. You have solved one of the grinding problems working people with young children face. So congratulate yourself and enjoy the extra pair of hands, and stop dwelling on the fact that the hands are attached to someone stunning.

Q. Work From Home Frustrations: I am lucky to have a job where I can work from home two days a week. My husband is not technically allowed to work from home, but does so when I am home with the blessing of his boss. It’s driving me nuts. We are not able to work in separate areas because we live in a small condo, and he works in cold calling sales, so I am not able to get the quiet I need. When I leave the condo to work elsewhere, he comes with me! His idea of “being by ourselves” means with each other, but focused on other things. How can I help him see that I need some time to be truly alone?


A: I work at home, and occasionally my husband does, too. Usually we’re on different floors, typing away like quiet little mice. But occasionally he has a phone call, and when he does he likes to bellow into the phone and walk in circles, so that I hear the rising and falling of his voice as he makes his circuit. I’ve very sweetly said to him, “If you don’t lower your voice and stay put, I’m going to take your phone and throw it out the window.” Give me your address; I can come over to your place and say it to your husband, or better yet just toss the phone out the window. Help him see he’s driving you around the bend by saying something to the effect of despite how much you love him, you’ll have to hit his phone with a hammer because you can’t work when someone is cold-calling people 5 feet away from you. Tell him that if he doesn’t stop working at home, you’re going to, because you need a room of your own to be able to think in peace.


Q. Kitchen Clean-Up Time Limit: What is the maximum time between when one prepares food and when one cleans up? My wife thinks that as long as it is cleaned up before bed, it’s OK. The result is a litter of cutting board, plates, etc., from breakfast through dinner attracting ants to our kitchen. I think one must clean up as one goes, and everything should be cleaned up within a few minutes of eating the meal. My wife says that robs the meal of enjoyment. Where do you come down?


A: I come down on hoping you two have a killer time in bed, otherwise I have a portrait of your marriage as an endless cycle of conflict over sloth and compulsion, focused on the cutting board. I hate a messy kitchen and my more casual husband has come to recognize it’s more pleasant for him to clean up after himself rather than deal with me hating a messy kitchen. But I will clean his mess myself rather than look at a dirty counter and sink. You two are out of sync on this issue. She’s a slob and you’re more than meticulous. If you can’t move her, surely it’s better to just sweep up the crumbs and wash off the cutting board yourself rather than fight over the parade of ants.


Q. Re: Hottie Helper ...: What if the letter writer insists the girl wear one of those French maid costumes while on duty?


A: Thank you for the laugh!


Q. Missing Gift?: I got married two weeks ago, and invited my boss, whom I have a good relationship with. He is very generous when people have babies, get married, etc. However, he did not give a gift for my wedding. I found it odd, but the money is not what’s important. However, when I mentioned this to a co-worker who is also a close friend (I would never speak about this to a casual colleague). She says she swears she saw him with a card, she remembers it was bright blue, and he was holding it when he walked in. Now I’m afraid it was misplaced or lost. Is there anyway to bring this up with him without coming off as a present-grabber? I can’t think of a scenario that wont be extremely awkward.




A: This is awkward, so the best thing to do is go to him and acknowledge this. Tell him his presence as your wedding was all the present you need, but you have something awkward to run by him. Say that when you were talking to a colleague who was at the wedding, she mentioned that the boss arrived with a bright blue card. Tell him you don’t know if she’s misremembering, but it concerned you because you never got said card. So if he did leave one on the gift table, you need to try to find out what happened to it. Tell him that if he didn’t, it will relieve your mind and reassure you that no one at the wedding was light-fingered.


Q. Re: Working From Home: Oy—I also work from home, having lost my corporate job two years ago and had no luck in finding a job. I have worked hard to develop a law practice from home, which allows me to spend time with my husband, who is a health care professional and keeps unusual hours, be around for my teenage son, and to help with a variety of eldercare responsibilities. Everyone is happy with this situation. But my husband and son will sometimes convene in my home office during working hours to discuss the latest football or hockey game. Threatening to get a lock for the door, or reading my very boring legal documents aloud seems to help.


A: You don’t need a lock if you can just start intoning, “The party of the first part …”


Q. Jewish Santa: My fiancé and I are set to get married next summer, and surely kids won’t be too far off. For most disagreements, we’ve been pretty good about finding a compromise or one person ceding ground where it doesn’t matter. For instance, she is Jewish and I was raised Catholic but am an atheist. She asked that our kids be raised Jewish (to which I agreed as I think there is a great benefit to having a moral structure). However, one sticking point we have is Santa. I strongly believe Santa (and Christmas) is a cultural holiday and want to celebrate it as such. She’s fine with celebrating Christmas, but for her, Santa is a religious symbol and is out of the question. I’m struggling to see if there’s a middle ground here and how to solve our predicament.


A: There seems to be some major Judeo-Christian confusion in your home. I do not understand your Jewish wife’s embrace of Christmas and rejection of Santa. Santa is a far step removed from the celebration of the birth of Christ, so maybe your wife needs an introductory religion course. It’s good you two are talking this out, because too many interfaith couples wait until it’s time to the trip to the mall for the photo with Santa to air their differences. However, there is also something a little odd about getting hung up more than six months before the wedding about how your nonexistent children will celebrate Christmas. I suggest you two take some classes offered by a local synagogue or Jewish community center for interfaith couples. That will give you a forum to figure out Santa, and a lot more issues.


Q. For Your Eyes Only: My husband and I have had a rocky sexual relationship. One day, while looking for something on his computer, I stumbled across websites where he’d posted compromising pictures of me. When confronted, he admitted it and apologized. I’m feeling betrayed because these photos he took of me I expressly said I wanted to be for his eyes only. “But your photos made it into the top 10!” he told me, based on the rating system. Please help.


A: Revenge porn is a horror. But this is the first I’ve heard of “My wife is hot, and she doesn’t know I’m posting this” porn. The violation here is stunning. You don’t just have a rocky sex life, you have a rocky marriage. Your husband’s behavior is shocking and grounds for you to be reassessing this marriage. First of all, insist he take everything down and never post anything about you again. Second, go to a marriage counselor together. You may not even want to salvage this relationship, but talking to a third party will give you some clarity about your next steps.


Q. Re: Missing Gift: This happened at my wedding too, and many more I’m sure. Please, Dear, Dear Prudie, tell people NOT to bring gifts to the wedding! Ship it before, ship it after, whatever, but a table at a wedding reception is not a safe place for a gift.


A: Miss Manners has hit this important point for decades to little effect. There are always going to be people who bring gifts. So at the venue it’s a good idea to have some kind of locked closet or secure room, or even the trunk of a car, where the gifts are stored to reduce the temptation.


Q. Re: Hottie Helper: I had an extremely beautiful au pair when my children were young and I was a little worried. The au pair coordinator said something that helped me a great deal: “The attractive au pairs can do so much better than your husband!” That made me giggle.


A: Love it! Thanks.


Q. Just Not Quite There: I’m a happy woman in her 20s with a lovely boyfriend, and am starting a new career. The problem is, I can’t seem to have an orgasm. Ever. Not even by myself. I’ve read books, spent time on it, and now just fake it for my partner because I just want him to be happy and satisfied enough for the both of us. But Prudie I am so frustrated, is this just something that happens to some women and am I doomed to be forever sexually frustrated?


A: I answered this question recently here, and among my suggestions was the purchase of the Magic Wand, available on Amazon. Read the explosive reviews. And if you do get the wand, and it does do the trick, in between climaxes write back and let us know.

Slate,L,"Hawaiian ""Mele Kalikimaka,"" Greek ""khristos,"" Xmas, and why not ""Hristmas"": Sound changes in Christmas vocabulary.","""Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say / On a bright Hawaiian Christmas day""

What makes Bing Crosby's classic Christmas tune (well, the other one anyway) so endearing? At least part of the appeal is ""Mele Kalikimaka"" itself, which sounds tantalizingly close to ""Merry Christmas"" and yet not quite the same. So how did the Hawaiian language end up with this phrase?


    Advertisement




Simply put, Hawaiian borrowed the English ""Merry Christmas,"" which speakers then adapted to fit the sounds of their language. In the video below, YouTuber Tom Scott explains how this process happened:









You can also think about English Christmas itself. Although the spelling hasn't changed, we've worn down the pronunciation a bit over the years from christ+mass to criss-miss: English vowels frequently morph into schwas, and when was the last time you heard someone actually pronounce that T?


Even with the T, of course, the Christ part of Christmas isn't Jesus' last name. Rather it's a title that comes from the Latin Christus—itself from the Greek khristos (χριστος) meaning ""the anointed""—a literal translation of the Hebrew mashiah (also the source of messiah). The ""kh"" in khristos represents the Greek letter chi, written X, which in Ancient Greek sounded a lot like, well, a K followed by an H (as in a careful pronunciation of steakhouse or backhand). Latin didn't use the letter K, so the Romans wrote it as ""C+H"" instead. But people pretty quickly started ignoring the H since there weren't any domestic Latin words with that K/C+H sound. Unless you knew Greek, you didn't really know what to do with words like chorus, chaos, or Achilles, and you just reverted to a hard C.


In fact, we narrowly escaped having the same confusion over the spelling of Christmas as we do over the spelling of Hanukkah (or is it Chanukkah?). The sound at the beginning of Hanukkah/Chanukkah isn't particularly common in English, but you may have encountered it in Scottish loch or German Bach. To some people, it sounds like a breathier /k/ (hence the C+H, which this time indicates breathiness), while to others it just sounds like a variation of /h/ itself. So Chanukkah and Hanukkah represent two different ways people have tried to explain this sound to English speakers. Neither are completely successful, because it's just plain hard to produce a sound that you're not accustomed to—which is why Latin ended up with the /k/ sound for ""ch"" and Hawaiian ended up with Mele Kalikimaka.


Back to Christmas. Although the Ancient Greeks pronounced the kh in khristos as K+H, they—some centuries later—eventually started pronouncing all instances of the letter chi as that same breathy sound found in loch, Bach, or Chanukkah/Hanukkah. So if we'd borrowed khristos at a much later date, and not via Latin, we might have ended up trying to write it phonetically using h—Hristmas!—which is in fact what Modern Greek speakers often end up doing when they're writing informally in our alphabet. But we didn't, so we don't.


And the fact that Greek chi is written X explains yet another Christmas linguistic mystery: why Christmas is abbreviated Xmas. It's originally Chi-mas, but English speakers don't pronounce it that way because of a further orthographic complication. When the Romans were borrowing and adapting the Greek alphabet, they managed to borrow the symbol X from a group of Greeks who used it to stand for the sound /ks/, despite the fact that the majority of Greeks—who they later borrowed lots of words from, including christus—used X to stand for that K+H sound.

The really inexplicable thing is why the Romans bothered borrowing anything to stand for /ks/, when they could have just written it with two letters, like they did with psi ψ as in psychology. But not to worry. As far as I know, Bing Crosby never wrote a song about how to say Merry Christmas in Ancient Greek.

Slate,L,How should Slate improve its comments section? A members-only open thread.,"This open thread is part of a package of coverage about commenting on Slate. Make sure to also check out “Are Comments Sections Worth It?,” a Slate Plus debate featuring writers Amanda Hess, Rachael Larimore, Amanda Marcotte, and Will Oremus, and “You Will Not Comment on This Article.”

At Slate’s annual retreat in September, Editor-in-Chief Julia Turner polled a packed room of staffers about the state of commenting on Slate. When she asked who wouldn’t mind if Slate eliminated the comments section entirely, about half the writers in the room raised their hands.


The media seems to be in a moment of commenting skepticism. See Popular Science, which removed commenting from its site in late 2013. Or Reuters and Re/code, a popular technology site, which both followed suit this November. Other sites no longer allow anonymous commenting, often requiring commenters to login via Facebook. Many Slate writers agree with these moves. They feel that commenting is broken, and they’re looking for change.

Stay cool—Slate isn’t planning to remove commenting from the site. But we do want to improve it.


How could we host better conversations on Slate? Tell us what you think in the thread below. We’re interested in hearing from both regular commenters and noncommenters. If you don’t comment, do you enjoy reading the threads? Is there anything that would make you more likely to comment? We’ll publish the best responses in a transcript next week.

Slate,L,Map of juvenile delinquents: DC map from 1935 showing homes of juvenile offenders. ,"The Vault is Slate's history blog. Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter @slatevault, and find us on Tumblr. Find out more about what this space is all about here.

This 1936 map of Washington, D.C. pinpoints residencies that had produced kids recently designated “juvenile delinquents.” The data for the map came from the District of Columbia’s Juvenile Court. The red marks on the map, which look similar from afar, are shaped differently: Stars mean “white girls”; squares are for “white boys”; circles indicate “colored girls”; and triangles denote “colored boys.”


Those responsible for printing this D.C. map may have been responding to recent work by Clifford R. Shaw, a sociologist whose book Delinquency Areas (1929) tracked 60,000 Chicago youths, mapping their addresses and trying to understand how the geography of the city might be contributing to truancy, delinquency, and criminality.


    Advertisement




Shaw and his collaborator Henry D. McKay believed that the presence of clusters of delinquents in certain areas of the city—lower-income neighborhoods that were close to industry and commerce—indicated that it was environment, and not personality, that caused delinquency. Evaluating an updated version of their work in 1942, Shaw and McKay wrote:


It would appear from the findings of this study that successful treatment of the problem of delinquency in large cities will entail the development of programs that will seek to effect changes in the conditions of life … Diagnosis and supervision of individual offenders probably will not be sufficient to achieve this end.


Since the time of Shaw’s and McKay’s work, contemporary sociologists have taken issue with their geographical approach’s inability to tell us more about the culture of the neighborhoods being assessed, or about the lives of the nondelinquent kids who lived there.  


I first saw this map on the blog Ghosts of DC. Click on the image to reach a zoomable version, or visit the map's page in the Harvard Map Collection's digital library.

Slate,L,"""Why doesn't she leave?"": The Janay Rice interview contains some answers to the perennial domestic violence question.","Reading Janay Rice's interview with Jemele Hill of ESPN, in which Rice explains why she is standing by her husband, Ray Rice, after he punched her out cold in an Atlantic City elevator, is hard. It's hard reading her make excuses for his behavior and hard reading her blame herself. It's hard reading about how much she lives in his world, which no doubt makes it that much harder to imagine life without him. It's hard reading about how Ray Rice put his wife in a position to comfort him and tiptoe around him, like he was the victim, mere hours after the incident. But it is important reading, if you want to understand the dynamics of domestic abuse and really get answers to that perennial question of why she stays.

Slate,L,"We don't need to ban frats to reduce rape rates, but it might help to integrate women into them.","The shocking story of a fraternity house gang rape at the University of Virginia published by Rolling Stone last month caused the school to temporarily suspend all the frats on campus, and it reopened the discussion about whether fraternities are an outdated institution that should be ended altogether. As Jay Hathaway at Gawker noted in his call to ban frats, ""The events reported in that story are an especially gruesome version of an act that is far too common at America's fraternities—according to a 2007 study, men who enter fraternities are three times as likely to commit rape as their fellow students who do not."" It makes sense that these archaically single-sex organizations would magnify already existing problems stemming from sexism, so it would follow that ending this tradition would do a lot of good.

Slate,L,"Sabrina Rubin Erdely, UVA: Why didn’t a Rolling Stone writer talk to the alleged perpetrators of a gang rape?","The Rolling Stone piece “A Rape on Campus” is a huge story in all senses of the word. It is long and expansive, documenting a culture at the University of Virginia that seems to shrug off sexual assault. It has also helped kick off a broad national conversation about fraternity culture, rape on campus, and whether our colleges and universities are equipped to adjudicate alleged sex crimes. At its heart, though, Sabrina Rubin Erdely’s article is about a single event: an orchestrated gang rape of a woman named Jackie. In the course of 9,000 words, Erdely chronicles an administration’s tepid response to a terrible crime. But what the piece is missing is one small thing: that single, standard sentence explaining that the alleged perpetrators of the crime deny it, or don’t deny it, or even that they could not be reached for comment. It’s often a boring sentence, one that comes off as boilerplate to readers, but it’s absolutely necessary, because it tells readers you tried your best to get the other side of the story. You notice when it isn’t there.

Last week, we invited Erdely on the DoubleX Gabfest to talk about the story. I asked her in several different ways if she knew anything about the seven men whom Jackie accused of committing this crime, or if she had talked to them. In the story, Jackie’s roommate at the time, Rachel Soltis, tells Erdely, “Me and several other people know exactly who did this to her.” Jackie says she still sees “Drew,” the guy she alleges orchestrated the gang rape, walking around campus sometimes. (Jackie is the alleged victim’s real first name. Drew is Erdely’s pseudonym for the alleged perpetrator.) Drew was on Jackie’s lifeguard shift at the university pool. He’s a junior and a member of the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. An open campus is relatively friendly terrain for a reporter, and students’ email addresses aren’t difficult to track down. He couldn’t be that hard to find. And yet, based on Erdely’s answers, we couldn’t tell how hard she’d tried.


I reached out to them in multiple ways. They were kind of hard to get in touch with because [the fraternity’s] contact page was pretty outdated. But I wound up speaking … I wound up getting in touch with their local president, who sent me an email, and then I talked with their sort of, their national guy, who’s kind of their national crisis manager. They were both helpful in their own way, I guess.

If you want to hear Erdely talk about this and more, you can listen to her complete interview on the DoubleX Gabfest:





Erdely’s editor at Rolling Stone, Sean Woods, has confirmed that the writer did not talk to Drew or any of the men that Jackie alleges participated in the rape. “We did not talk to them. We could not reach them,” he told the Washington Post, although he added that the magazine verified their existence by talking to Jackie’s friends. “I’m satisfied that these guys exist and are real,” he said. “We knew who they were.”


In her story, Erdely does describe a scene in which Jackie’s “three best friends on campus” encounter her immediately after the alleged incident. The way Erdely writes that scene, it’s impossible to know if she’s getting the quotes directly from the friends (whose names have been changed in the story) or from Jackie’s recollection of what they said. Mostly, it seems to be the latter. Here, they discuss whether they should take Jackie to the hospital:


Their other two friends, however, weren’t convinced. “Is that such a good idea?” she recalls Cindy asking. “Her reputation will be shot for the next four years.” Andy seconded the opinion, adding that since he and Randall both planned to rush fraternities, they ought to think this through.


We don’t hear how Cindy recalls that same conversation, one that is pretty damning to Cindy.


Both Erdely and Woods have said that they decided to tell the story mostly from Jackie’s point of view. As Woods told the Post, “We were telling Jackie’s story. It’s her story.”



Erdely was in a tough position. Push too hard and she might lose Jackie. But not pushing harder has created a whole new nightmare.



In that same Post piece, Erdely seems protective of Jackie. She said that she did not identify the men in the article “by Jackie’s request. She asked me not to name the individuals because she’s so fearful of them. That was something we agreed on.” Erdely would not say, however, whether she knew who they were. “I can’t answer that,” she told the Post. “This was a topic that made Jackie extremely uncomfortable.”


Erdely is a very accomplished magazine writer. She has written about many difficult subjects before, including an OB-GYN who was convicted of fondling his patients. (She didn’t talk to him either, but she did include a sentence saying he could not be reached for comment. Plus, he had already been convicted.) She must know the basic rules of reporting a story like this: You try very, very hard to reach anyone you’re accusing of something. You use any method you can think of, including the jerk reporter move of making a surprise, in-person confrontation. (Sarah Koenig, the host of the Serial podcast, provides a good example of reporter due diligence.) You try especially hard if you are writing about something as serious as a gang rape accusation. Sometimes, what results is a more layered version of the truth. Sometimes, the answer you get makes the accused seem even guiltier (e.g., Bill Cosby, asserting through a lawyer, that all the dozens of accusations against him are “fabricated”).


If you fail to reach the person, you write a sentence explaining that you tried—and explaining how you tried—as a way to assure your readers that you gave the person a chance to defend themselves. We’re not sure why Rolling Stone didn’t think that was necessary.




Why aren’t we sure what Rolling Stone thought? Here is our standard sentence: I emailed and called Erdely to ask her some follow-up questions after she appeared on the DoubleX Gabfest, but she sent me to Rolling Stone’s public relations person. Woods, her editor, said he was “done talking about the story” and sent a statement from Rolling Stone that read, in part, “Through our extensive reporting and fact-checking, we found Jackie to be entirely credible and courageous and we are proud to have given her disturbing story the attention it deserves.” 


It could be that Erdely did try her hardest to reach the alleged rapists. Or it could be that she didn’t, out of deference to Jackie. We’ve interviewed many of Jackie’s friends, including some who were quoted in the Rolling Stone story. They verified that Jackie did get very upset when Erdely wanted to find out more about the alleged assailants. Sara Surface, a good friend of Jackie’s and a member of One Less, a victim advocacy group at UVA, had the impression that Jackie’s reaction was “extreme” when Erdely pressed her—meaning that Jackie became so terrified that she reconsidered going public with her story, even anonymously. If that’s true, then Erdely was in a tough position. Push too hard and she might lose Jackie. But not pushing harder has created a whole new nightmare.


Various writers and media outlets have now started to pick apart Erdely’s reporting, as well as the details of Jackie’s story as reported by Rolling Stone. That’s because, even by the standards of horrific, despicable frat behavior, this story stands out. Jackie, who says she was sober, was allegedly led upstairs by her date into a dark room, where seven men allegedly raped her as others egged them on. She tells Erdely that she was smashed into a glass coffee table and raped by a beer bottle. Drew, who had invited her to the frat party as his date, allegedly stood by and orchestrated the whole thing. When he later ran into Jackie, she says that he told her he’d had a “great time.” That’s not expected behavior even by the standards of rapists. That’s psychotic.


Caitlin Flanagan, who did an investigation into bad behavior at fraternities for the Atlantic, emailed us:


In all my time studying fraternity rapes for my own essay, I didn’t come across a single report of anything like this. I did find reports of women who were raped by multiple men on one night—but those always involved incapacitation, either by alcohol or a drugged drink. And I did also find accounts of violent, push-down rape of the kind in the essay—but those were always by one member, not a bunch of members. (In fact, many of that kind—now that I think about it—were committed by non-members, or by visiting former members). But a planned gang rape, without alcohol or drugs, and keyed to initiation—I have never seen a case like that. Nor have I seen penetration with a foreign object—I’ve seen plenty of that committed by brothers to pledges as hazing, but I haven’t seen it in sexual assault cases. I’m sure it’s happened, but again—as part of a ritualized gang rape ... Never anything like it.


To be clear, just because Flanagan hasn’t heard of anything like this before doesn’t mean it didn’t happen exactly as Jackie describes. But with a story this extreme, you want the assurance that a journalist did everything she possibly could to verify its accuracy. What’s at stake here is not just a small point of journalistic standards. As Flanagan pointed out to us in her email, if the story doesn’t check out, “it is going to cause so much trouble in the area of reforming fraternity sexual assault, I can’t even tell you.” At the moment, there is significant pressure to enact those reforms. At a faculty meeting on Tuesday, UVA President Teresa Sullivan said she is considering having both the Charlottesville and the university police do a joint patrol of the fraternities, as well as holding more classes on Fridays. For her part, Flanagan has recently been invited to speak to a large gathering of fraternity advisers about addressing fraternity rape. Inviting her, she says, is a “huge opening” in their thinking. “But if this turns out to be a hoax, it is going to turn the clock back on their thinking 30 years.”


We found Jackie and she agreed to talk to us. Then, at the last minute she backed out. She had already been interviewed by the Washington Post for a story that has not yet run, and she had picked up that the media had some doubts—something that she is understandably sensitive to. What became clear from talking to Jackie’s supporters at UVA is that the community of victim advocates operates by a very specific code. “The first thing as a friend we must say is, ‘I believe you and I am here to listen,’ ” says Brian Head, president of UVA’s all-male sexual assault peer education group One in Four. Head and others believe that questioning a victim is a form of betrayal, because it will make her feel judged and all the more reluctant to ever speak about what happened. None of the people we spoke to had asked Jackie who the men were, and in fact none of them had any idea. They did not press her on any details about the incident.


“A lot of the reason why we aren’t questioning Jackie urgently about who the names are or anything like that is because our role as advocates and friends is really just to support the survivor,” says Alexandria Pinkleton, another member of One Less and a friend of Jackie’s who was also quoted in the Rolling Stone story. “If she doesn’t want to give us the names, that’s not something were going to press her for.” This is a point of tension between Erdely and the activists, one that is apparent in her conclusion. Erdely blames the UVA administration, “which chose not to act on her allegations in any way.” The activists, however, think the administration was correct not to pressure Jackie into pressing charges before she was ready.


We agree with Erdely here. If a college administrator hears about a gang rape, the first thing she should do is call the police. The irony here is that Erdely fell into the same trap as UVA administrators: They both deferred to the victim’s sensitivities to such an extent that they failed to out the alleged rapists.


The university told us it has asked the Charlottesville Police Department to investigate the alleged incident described in Erdely’s article. So far there haven’t been any public confirmations or denials. There may never be. Jackie is firm in her story, and it’s hard to prove that something didn’t happen. An interview with the alleged perpetrators wouldn’t necessarily constitute proof either way. What it would provide is additional data, information that could help us assess what might have happened in that fraternity house.


At the end of that interview on the DoubleX Gabfest, I asked Erdely how she might defend Jackie in court—what evidence she would present if the case went to trial. Erdely said she wasn’t a lawyer but “given the degree of her trauma, there’s no doubt in my mind that something happened to her that night. What exactly happened I don’t know. I wasn’t in that room. I don’t know.” That’s the worst part of being a reporter. You are often not in the room. But in this case, seven other people allegedly were. Where are they?

Slate,L,Bill Cosby rape allegations: Tina Fey brought them up on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update in 2005 (VIDEO).,"On Wednesday, Laura Bradley wrote about the 30 Rock joke that appears to call out Bill Cosby for the rape allegations against him. It was on an episode that aired in 2009, a time when few prominent people were talking about those allegations. The episode was written by 30 Rock creator and star Tina Fey.


Back in 2005, when the allegations against Cosby were in the news, Tina Fey was co-host, with Amy Poehler, of Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live. And she not only mentioned the allegations on the show, she highlighted the reason other people—specifically, in this joke, Kenan Thompson, being a good sport here as usual—didn’t want to talk about them: because Bill Cosby was a powerful man who could affect someone’s ability to get work.

Slate,L,Football on Thanksgiving: How the Dallas Cowboys ruined Turkey Day.,"This morning, like all mornings, the dog-walking ritual led past the house where Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry and his family had lived during most of what’s now known, almost exclusively, as his “storied tenure.”

Spacious home, circular drive out front, guest house in the back. Perhaps it is because the man who lived on the corner was named, I swear to God, Edgar Allan Poe, but the old Landry homestead whispers of stories from those thrilling days of yesterday. And this particular week, I feel compelled to say to the dog, “Look there, Rambo. You know used to live there? The man who ruined Thanksgiving. That’s who.”


In fairness to Landry, the Thanksgiving gambit wasn’t his idea. Yes, Landry was the chief tactical officer of the greatest sports-marketing taskforce of its era. But it was general manager Tex Schramm, a former employee of CBS Sports, who in 1966 recognized that an annual home game on Turkey Day could help transform his young franchise into America’s Team.

Flashback: Thanksgiving, 1966. I was writing for the Fort Worth Press at the time. Earlier that year, the wife of Cleveland Browns quarterback Frank Ryan had ventured into the public print and referred to his Cowboys counterpart, Don Meredith, as a “loser.” Would the allure of a football game—one preceded by those fighting words—draw certain men to abandon their loved ones on a holiday occasion? Well, 80,259 fans showed up at the Cotton Bowl, the most ever to see a game in Dallas. Every seat was occupied, and the aisles were jammed. The Cowboys, who at that point had yet to have a winning season, beat the mighty Cleveland Browns 26-14, and throughout the last quarter everyone was chanting, “Ryan is a loser!” Dallas was en route to its initial division championship, and the frothing Thanksgiving multitudes anointed pro sports’ new megateam.


About two hours after the game, Meredith himself materialized in a well-known honky-tonk just south of downtown called Dewey Groom’s Longhorn Ranch. It was Thanksgiving night, the joint was packed, and Dandy Don wanted to be seen. He had, in tow, a man with dark hair trimmed Ward Cleaver-style, a fellow who looked almost Pentecostal in his plain dark suit, white shirt, and narrow black tie. I recognized him as a promising songwriter and struggling singer named Willie Nelson. Enriched with holiday cheer, I approached Nelson and assured him that superstardom lurked just ahead. Although he does not remember the occasion, it provided the foundation of his career.


At the conclusion of the evening, one factor emerged, blazingly evident: The face of the traditional Thanksgiving in North Texas had just undergone a massive makeover.


The Texas-Texas A&M rivalry had been a Thanksgiving staple since the advent of nationally televised college games. People cared about the game, sure, but the college game was usually over before 3 o’clock.


But the Cowboys, the all-new, chrome-plated muscle car of the NFL—they were going to have a bigger impact on Dallas-Fort Worth Thanksgivings than the discovery of alcohol would have on St. Patrick’s Day. And the results—and the 3:15 p.m. CST annual kickoff—have not been entirely rewarding. The football game dictates what time people are supposed to show up and what time you serve them the meal. It’s too early for a lot of people and too late for the rest, and all too often you’re stuck with guests who are unfit for the highway. Put the food out in the middle of the first quarter and you’ll set the table for a Thanksgiving parade, with various guests getting up and looking into the den to check on the score.


The natural solution to the mealtime quandary has been to turn the sit-down affair into a tailgate party. Begin early. Ideally, have a nephew on leave from the Coast Guard who’s willing to tend bar. The football aspect has warped Thanksgiving in this region to the point that the success of the family interchange relies mostly on the outcome of the game. I assume that family counselors, emergency rooms, and divorce lawyers see business skyrocket when the Cowboys lose on Thanksgiving.


Sometimes even the most innocent remark can spoil the whole weekend. From past years, I hear the voice of a 7-year-old child. “Mom,” the voice says. “After the Cowboys lost, Dad was in the kitchen and he said the fuck-word and Grandma heard him.” Mom issues Dad a look of, to be charitable, profound dismay. Unkind remarks ensue, and by the conclusion of the evening, Dad could show Tiger Woods a thing or two about a hard luck Thanksgiving … all because Dallas chose to lose.


The worst was the Great White Apocalypse of 1993. Thanksgiving brought two things to town: the Miami Dolphins and a North Dakota–quality blizzard. The playing field was coated with ice and sleet. The Dolphins’ last-gasp field goal effort was partially blocked, ending the game. Well, it would have ended the game, but Dallas’ Leon Lett for some reason decided to skid into the ball, kicking it free. The Dolphins recovered, kicked the winning field goal, and won the game.

What bonehead stuff. TV sets throughout the region did not survive the festivities, having been kicked by grown men and struck by glass containers. Worse, the ice was so deep and solid that guests were trapped. Driving, even to the corner bottle shop, was unthinkable. So now the host was stuck with the demanding in-law and the surly stepkid though Thursday night … Friday … Saturday … and finally the roads were cleared on Sunday. The thing that kept us all from murdering each other, remembers one survivor of the shittiest freeze in Texas football history, was the unification that came from our mutual contempt of Leon Lett.


So I’ll walk past the Landry house on Thanksgiving morning and try to pick up on his aura. With the Eagles in Arlington on Thursday, the mood of the Cowboys fan is drifting dangerously close to the rapture zone. Common sense paranoia suggests a Thanksgiving ambush. The occasion seems to call for cocktails about a half hour before kickoff. Maybe those Coast Guard Bloody Marys my nephew used to prepare: ample portions of PGA (pure grain alcohol) and dill pickle juice to mitigate the low-rent taste. Three of those, and you can experience post-game aches and pains, just like the real players do. It's Texas Thanksgiving tradition.

Slate,L,"Eric Garner, no indictment: Grand jury declines to charge Daniel Pantaleo.","A Staten Island grand jury will not indict New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo in the choking death of Eric Garner, reports indictate. From the New York Times:

An indictment was considered only against Officer Pantaleo, who testified last, on Nov. 21, his lawyer, Stuart London, said. The other officers received immunity, he said.


The case exposed lapses in police tactics – chokeholds are banned by the Police Department’s own guidelines – and raised questions about the aggressive policing of minor offenses in a time of historically low crime. The officers, part of a plainclothes unit, suspected Mr. Garner of selling loose cigarettes on the street near the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, a complaint among local business owners.

The city's medical examiner ruled in August that Garner's death was a homicide caused by the chokehold. Pantaleo could still be punished by the NYPD; New York television station Pix11 has asserted that Pantaleo did not mention using the banned maneuver in an official police report on the incident.

Slate,L,"Grand jury subpoena and FBI search lead LA school district to end iPad, Pearson contract.","In June 2013, L.A. schools approved a contract to allow Apple and Pearson to provide iPads loaded with educational software to local classrooms. By October 2013, students were regularly hacking the tablets to play games and browse the Web.


But in October 2014, L.A. schools superintendent John Deasy resigned amid accusations that he didn’t disclose close relationships with Apple and Pearson executives. As if things weren’t already looking bad for the $1.3 billion project, the FBI is now investigating it.


    Advertisement




As the Los Angeles Times reports, school officials gave 20 boxes’ worth of documents related to the iPad initiative to the FBI, per a grand jury subpoena. The investigation is mainly looking at talks and evaluations that went on before bidding started for the L.A. school district’s iPad contract. The subpoena calls for “score sheets; complete notepads, notebooks and binders; reports; contracts; agreements; consent forms; files; notices; agenda; meetings notes and minutes; instructions; accounting records” and other records.



The investigation seems to be looking for inappropriate relationships and dealings that might have influenced the bidding process. “We’re not going to use the original iPad contract anymore,” said Ramon C. Cortines, the current school superintendent. “There have been too many innuendos, rumors, etc.” He says the plan to suspend the contract was agreed upon before the FBI search.


The iPad program has been mired in controversy since its conception, with critics pointing out its huge cost and dubious contribution to daily learning. Before the 2014–2015 school year even began, Deasy had suspended the contract with Apple and Pearson to potentially redo the bidding process. Now it seems like the contract is really dead. Again. But for real this time.

Slate,L,Young v. UPS: The Supreme Court takes up pregnant workers’ rights.,"For those of us still sitting shiva for abortion clinic buffer zones and the contraceptive coverage mandate, it might feel too soon to point out the brand new landmines awaiting women in the Supreme Court’s current term. But on Wednesday, the court will hear arguments in another case involving the reproductive lives of America’s female workers—this one interpreting the scope of the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act, or PDA. Given this court’s track record, advocates for gender equality—sorry, Justice Alito, no quotation marks for me—are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.


In order to continue earning a paycheck while pregnant, many women will need their employers to make some adjustments.



The case, Young v. UPS, comes from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and concerns Peggy Young, who worked as a driver for the courier service in Landover, Maryland. Young became pregnant in 2006 and was instructed by her medical provider, as many pregnant women are, to avoid lifting more than 20 pounds. Young rarely had to deliver packages that heavy, but UPS refused to excuse her from those duties, or to reassign her for the remainder of her pregnancy to a “light duty” job. UPS had a policy allowing such temporary reassignments but limited them to three circumstances, none of which applied to pregnancy: when a worker’s impairment was due to an on-the-job injury, qualified her for “reasonable accommodation” under the Americans With Disabilities Act (which typically does not include a “normal” pregnancy), or had caused her to lose her commercial driver’s license.


Unwilling to disregard her doctor’s directive, Young had to go on unpaid leave. At that point, she was just 14 weeks pregnant. She ultimately went without pay for six months and lost her medical coverage before having her baby because she didn’t work the number of hours UPS required to maintain those benefits.


    Advertisement




Young’s story is increasingly typical. Women now constitute close to half the workforce, and three-quarters of them will be pregnant at least once during their working lives. Most pregnant women stay on the job right up until their due dates; according to a U.S. Census Bureau study, in the past 50 years, the number of women working into their ninth month more than doubled, with a whopping 82 percent of women who gave birth between 2006 and 2008 working into their final month of pregnancy. Coupled with these demographic realities are pregnancy’s medical realities: Even an uncomplicated pregnancy can cause nausea, migraines, urinary tract infections, carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and chronic fatigue while more serious conditions include diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, placenta previa, and pre-eclampsia. For women in jobs that involve prolonged standing (retail clerks, cashiers), are physically strenuous or dangerous (firefighters, law enforcement officers), or include contact with toxic materials (janitors, hotel housekeepers), pregnancy can be in direct conflict with their ability to work. Simply put, in order to continue earning a paycheck while pregnant, many women will need their employers to make some adjustments.


Many, like UPS, resist doing so. Some of these employers are household names (Walmart, Pier One, Old Navy, Kroger), and others you’ve probably never heard of (Fierman Produce Exchange, Unique Thrift, the city of Florence, Kentucky). A joint report published in 2013 by the National Women’s Law Center and A Better Balance noted that even seemingly easy fixes, like allowing a woman to carry a water bottle or to sit down periodically, have been denied time and again. Indeed, a recent study by the National Partnership for Women & Families estimates that more than 250,000 women a year have their accommodation requests denied. These women are left with the Hobson’s choice of risking their pregnancies or losing their jobs. While Young was lucky enough to keep hers—after her three months of Family and Medical Leave Act leave ran out, she was allowed to take an extended leave of absence, albeit unpaid, under the terms of her union contract—countless others are simply fired for absenteeism. In either case, for an expectant mother to lose a paycheck just as she’s about to have another mouth to feed is a devastating outcome.


This has been going on for years. What’s new is that women are increasingly turning to the courts, accounting in part for an explosion of pregnancy discrimination charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that enforces the PDA, and its state counterparts. Charges filed with those agencies increased by nearly 50 percent between 1997 and 2011, and recent statistics confirm that women in low-wage and “nontraditional” jobs are filing most of those claims.


Under the PDA, employers are required to treat pregnant women the same as workers who are “similar in their ability or inability to work.” Young argued that because UPS accommodated workers with physical limitations other than pregnancy—that is, it granted light duty to workers who were “similar” to Young in their “inability” to perform all job functions—then it violated the PDA by refusing to grant the same to her. But the trial judge dismissed Young’s case and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that dismissal, for two reasons. First, because UPS’s policy didn’t specifically state a bias against pregnant workers, then it wasn’t deemed discriminatory. And second, the court reasoned that Young actually wasn’t “similar” to any of those three categories of workers to whom UPS granted accommodation, so she wasn’t entitled to be treated the same as they were.


The first rationale has been followed by a number of other courts, and is patently wrong. To explain why requires a brief detour into the history of why the PDA was passed in the first place. Congress enacted the law in 1978 as a direct rebuke to a recent Supreme Court decision finding that General Electric’s policy of excluding pregnancy benefits from its employees’ disability plan did not discriminate against women, even though only women can get pregnant so only women were harmed by the policy.* In the court’s memorable words, a distinction between pregnant women and “non-pregnant persons” was a distinction based on a particular medical condition, not gender. Voilà—no sex discrimination.




It was precisely this specious distinction that Congress rejected in passing the PDA two years later. It recognized that when a pregnant employee is denied benefits granted to other employees, it’s sex discrimination, even in the absence of a stated bias against pregnant workers.


The 4th Circuit’s second rationale—that Peggy Young was not entitled to a light duty assignment because she was not “similar” to others who did get them—exposes a fundamental limitation in the PDA as currently written: A pregnant worker gets an accommodation only if other employees with comparable impairments get them, too. The 4th Circuit and other courts have ignored the statute’s built-in definition of who’s comparable—those “similar in their ability or inability to work”—instead requiring that the other employees be similar to the pregnant worker in all respects. So a worker who is accommodated because of an on-the-job injury, or an ADA-qualifying disability, or a lost commercial driver’s license, is not “similar” to a pregnant worker. Thus, the pregnant worker can’t seek the same accommodation.


Without a court remedy, retooling the PDA itself is another strategy: The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act has been introduced each year in Congress since 2012 and would establish an independent right of accommodation for pregnancy—that is, a right that doesn’t tether pregnant workers’ fates to their co-workers’. Nine states and some municipalities already have some version of the PWFA, but those laws assist a fraction of the women who need their protections.


Whatever the outcome in Young, clarity can’t come soon enough. UPS did its part to muddy the waters by announcing in its Supreme Court brief, filed in late October, that it had changed its accommodation policy to include pregnancy, though that backtracking comes too late to help Young. (UPS claims it made the change not because the PDA requires it but just to make the company’s life easier as it becomes subject to the patchwork of new state and local accommodation laws.) Meanwhile, even employers who purport to want to do the right thing get it wrong. For instance, after pressure from a coalition of female employees, female shareholders, and women’s rights groups, including the filing of a class-action complaint with the EEOC, Walmart announced in the spring that it was changing its policy regarding pregnancy accommodation. But while the company abandoned its Young-like position that pregnant women never are entitled to the same modifications as ADA-protected workers, its new policy only applies to those pregnant women deemed “disabled”—a definition that’s left up to Walmart to determine in each case. It’s far from certain whether someone like Peggy Young, who sought relief from heavy lifting to preserve a healthy pregnancy, would qualify; both advocates and Walmart employees are agitating for the company to revise the policy further.


Meanwhile, the chorus supporting Peggy Young is getting louder. In July, the EEOC issued a new “enforcement guidance” on pregnancy discrimination that roundly criticized the Young court and its ilk as misconstruing the PDA. It also joined a “friend of the court” brief submitted by the federal government in Young urging reversal of the 4th Circuit’s ruling. A number of prominent women’s groups have filed similar briefs, as have federal, state, and local legislators, law professors, female business leaders, labor unions, and even a coalition of anti-abortion organizations (who contend, accurately, that without on-the-job accommodation, some desperate women will have abortions so that they can keep working).  


Of course, when it comes to this Supreme Court’s take on women, pregnancy, and employment rights, there is good reason to think its decision in Young will only make things worse. But, as illustrated by the infamous Lilly Ledbetter pay discrimination decision in 2007—which prompted a swift rebuttal from Congress in the form of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act—not to mention the PDA itself, enacted to nullify the General Electric ruling, sometimes lawmakers’ best motivation comes from a disaster in the judiciary. If the court upholds the 4th Circuit’s narrow, wrongheaded reading of the PDA, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act might finally get traction.


Regardless of whether resolution comes from the court or Congress, it’s about time that we acknowledge that pregnancy is a major medical event for working women, and some women’s job duties may conflict with pregnancy’s physical effects. Without some collective commitment to making the temporary accommodations necessary for those women to continue working safely, then we’re committing to a future full of Peggy Youngs—women whose pregnancies cost them their paychecks.

Slate,L,Google Tax: The UK cracks down on multinational companies shifting profits and taxes abroad.,"On Wednesday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced to Parliament the creation of a new diverted profits tax—or, colloquially, a ""Google tax."" Set to take effect in April 2015, the 25 percent tax is designed to keep companies from exploiting loopholes to dodge taxes on profits they make in the United Kingdom.

Google's U.K. operation is notorious for paying relatively little tax on the piles of money it makes there. In May 2013, a special report in Reuters showed how Google funneled its U.K. sales through Ireland to escape local tax liability. From 2006 to 2011, Google generated $18 billion in revenue from the U.K., Reuters reported, but paid only $16 million in taxes. Despite running most of its operations in London, Google for tax purposes claimed not to have a presence in the U.K.

The new tax doesn't just target Google, but also pressures other companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks to pay their taxes locally instead of shifting them to lower-tax markets overseas. Obsorne told Parliament that the Google tax has the potential to raise about $475 million a year—certainly not nothing, but also not terribly much compared with the U.K.'s budget deficit of 91.6 billion pounds (or roughly $143.9 billion).


The ""Google tax"" is the latest effort by governments to stop multinational corporations from going to great lengths to avoid paying taxes. Another such measure, the ever-popular tax inversion, was a topic of much debate this summer after Burger King said it was set to purchase Tim Hortons in what appeared an effort to shift its headquarters to Canada to escape the high U.S. corporate tax rates.

Slate,L,Stephanie Diani: Live Audience! Looks at the people who attend multiple television tapings (PHOTOS).,"During her years living in Los Angeles, Stephanie Diani was intrigued whenever she passed the long lines of people waiting to get into television show tapings. She wanted to create a series that spoke to the diehard aspect of being serial studio audience members.  

“It just seemed so Hollywood and sad and funny, and I always wanted to shoot them and I could never figure out how to do it,” she said.


When Diani decided to follow through on a lifelong dream and leave L.A. for Manhattan, she quickly put out a casting call for people who had been to at least four tapings to create the series “Live Audience!” Diani decided to recreate the studio audience effect and photographed her subjects using studio lights. She gave them direction about what to wear as well as instructions to act out specific emotions for fake television shows, similar to what they would hear from directors during tapings.

“During the tapings, they really orchestrate the audience,” she said. “They take you through emotions before the show starts, then tape the show and get actual reactions but they use both [in the final edit]. I decided to take these people through fake scenarios that showed extreme emotion.”


She photographed about 18 people in one day and then edited them to show one larger image with little expression paired with four smaller images that show a wide range of more exaggerated emotion. She also asked each person to write a one-sentence biography and to list all of the shows for which they had been part of the studio audience.

Slate,L,Sam Hinkie: Is the Philadelphia 76ers’ lose-on-purpose approach to team-building ingenious or morally bankrupt?,"Sometime during the last 18 months, the Philadelphia 76ers ceased being a basketball team and became an avant-garde, vaguely basketball-ish idea. It might have happened in June 2013, when the Sixers traded All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday for a draft pick they used on promising but injured center Nerlens Noel, whom they then shelved for the entire 2013-14 season. It might have happened in February 2014, when they shipped out Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes at the trade deadline for a motley assemblage of journeymen, second-round draft picks, and one former All-Star (Danny Granger), who was immediately jettisoned, lest his basket-making skills infect his new teammates with the ability to win NBA games. Or maybe it happened this June, when the Sixers used the third pick of the 2014 draft on Joel Embiid, another injured center who may or may not play this year, thus ensuring that a team that had lost an NBA-record-tying 26 consecutive games in 2013-14 somehow found a way to not improve.

Whatever else you want to say about them, you can’t accuse the 2014-15 Philadelphia 76ers of failing to meet expectations. They are on pace to be the worst team in NBA history according to a variety of statistical indicators, the harshest being their win-loss record: Philly currently sits at 0-10, having lost those 10 games by an average of 16.9 points. In Monday’s loss to the Spurs, the Sixers came out with a starting five of Tony Wroten, Hollis Thompson, Luc Mbah a Moute, Brandon Davies, and Henry Sims. It is not an exaggeration to say that none of them would start for any other NBA team. (Except maybe the Lakers. Probably the Lakers.) The Sixers’ best player is Michael Carter-Williams, a big and talented point guard who was last season’s Rookie of the Year, which means that everyone assumes the Sixers are trying to trade him. Their highest-paid player is Jason Richardson, an aging guard who hasn’t appeared in an NBA game in nearly two years. (Richardson is one of only two players on the roster who is older than 25.) The Sixers employ a small forward who wears number 99 and a point guard who wears number 88, perhaps in homage to seldom-used Eagles wide receiver Jeff Maehl, although probably not.


If you do not follow the NBA, you might be surprised to learn that the man who assembled this team has not been fired. The Max Bialystock of this production is general manager Sam Hinkie, a 36-year-old stats maven who’s either a genius or someone with a genius for being called a genius. Hinkie holds an MBA from Stanford, and prior to joining the Sixers in 2013 spent nearly a decade apprenticing under Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey, arguably the NBA’s most prominent evangelist of statistical analysis.



Are the Hinkie haters so wrong to suggest that a basketball team should be built so as to win basketball games?



    Advertisement




Hinkie is about as far from an insider as one can find in the clubby confines of professional hoops: He played no organized basketball past high school, and before arriving in the NBA he worked for Bain Capital, in Australia. By all accounts, he is exceptionally smart, and he’s nothing if not forward-thinking. In a profession where job security is as precarious as a Dwight Howard free throw, Hinkie—with the support of ownership in Philadelphia—has taken a long-game approach to roster construction that’s visionary, immoral, or both.


There’s a widely held belief that the worst thing an NBA team can be is mediocre. If you’re not great, then you might as well be terrible, as a horrible win-loss record is the ticket to the top of the draft lottery, where you just might find the sport’s next superstar. Well-managed teams realize this, and poorly run ones don’t (ladies and gentlemen, your 21st-century New York Knicks!), which means that sometimes very good teams will become very bad teams, as a stepping stone to vice versa. The best recent practitioners of this badness-to-goodness approach are the Oklahoma City Thunder, whose mid-2000s run of futility (partly as the Seattle Supersonics) landed them Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, and the departed James Harden, and a renewed identity as a perennial contender.


But no organization has ever bottomed out quite as extravagantly as these Sixers, a team that drafts players who literally cannot play and trades players who can in order to draft more players who can’t. What the Sixers lack in flesh-and-blood basketball talent they make up for in that most alluring buzzword of the contemporary NBA: assets. The one inconvenience of that strategy is that the 2014-2015 Philadelphia 76ers exist, albeit barely, as an ongoing professional basketball concern. While the enlightened fan can be heartened by assets—future draft picks, promising youngsters on team-friendly contracts—he can’t root for them. In the meantime, the actual humans who wear Sixers uniforms recently lost 123-70 to the Mavericks, which wasn’t that bad a result considering they trailed 73-29 at halftime.




If you buy what Hinkie is selling, then that score is totally meaningless. The team’s collection of future picks is vertigo-inducing. If the Sixers draft wisely, if Carter-Williams continues to develop (either as a point guard or a trade chip), if cap space can lure quality free-agent veterans, if Noel and Embiid rise to anywhere near their speculative potential, then the Sixers could have a dominant team for years to come in the not-so-intimidating Eastern Conference, and maybe quicker than anyone thinks. But that’s an awful lot of ifs, and in the meantime good luck selling luxury boxes or even nosebleed seats to watch an unprotected 2017 first-round pick.


What’s most fascinating about the Sixers is that they’ve literalized pro sports’ championship-or-bust mindset. This team is, essentially, an experiment in how much abuse fans are willing to tolerate in exchange for promises of a dynasty down the road. Philadelphians, as you’d expect, are not flocking to see this gruesome science project—the Sixers are third from the bottom in the NBA in attendance. It’s asking an awful lot of fans to put money into a team that isn’t trying to win, particularly when it seems content to stretch this period of intentional loserdom into something like a minor era. After all, there are words for people who abuse the patience of others, and rest assured that Sixers fans are familiar with all of them.


Philadelphia natives take their sports rather seriously, he wrote as he ducked out of the way of a battery. As to be expected, camps have formed. The pro-Hinkie side has taken the form of a half-ironic personality cult: jokily messianic memes abound, #INHINKIEWETRUST is a running hashtag, and the popular blog Liberty Ballers hosted a draft day party replete with Hinkie T-shirts. Tongue-in-cheek as much of this is, there is optimism and even excitement among a certain cadre of Sixers fans, a group that relishes being part of what is, at the very least, a bold attempt to refashion a not-so-successful franchise.


On the other end of the spectrum are old-media stalwarts like Philly sportscaster Howard Eskin, who’s been known to rail against the “Hinkie apologists” (including his own son). There’s also ex-Sixers coach and wandering curmudgeon Larry Brown, who recently kvetched to the Philadelphia Inquirer that the Sixers “don’t have a basketball person in the organization. It makes me sick to my stomach.” (Brown led the Sixers to their last Finals appearance in 2001 by strapping the team to the back of Allen Iverson, an electrifying guard whose shot-happy inefficiency made him, incidentally, the precise sort of player the analytics crowd is stereotyped as loathing.)


It’s easy to caricature all of this as Moneyball on the hardwood, brainy progress squaring off against brawny conservatism. But are the Hinkie haters so wrong to suggest that a basketball team should be built so as to win basketball games? There’s a fine line between outside-the-box creativity and running a franchise like you’re part of some obscurantist, too-clever-by-half fantasy league. While it’s a bit dopey to say that sports exist for the fans, the Sixers’ disavowal of anything like basketball aesthetics nevertheless feels like an affront.


And what if it turns out that Hinkie isn’t actually the smartest guy in the room? By taking asset acquisition to its logical extreme, the Sixers may well have convinced the NBA that its current method of parceling out talent is in fact illogical. A few weeks ago, a proposal to reform the draft lottery to disincentivize tanking fell just six votes shy of passing. If significant changes are pushed through while the Sixers’ experiment is in progress, what now appears to be a madcap experiment could swiftly transform into a doomed basketball hellscape.

The record for futility in an 82-game season already belongs to Philadelphia, set by a ’72-’73 Sixers squad that went a brisk 9-73 (you’ll hear those numbers a lot this season). That Sixers team was awarded the top pick straightaway, and claimed as its prize future All-Star/coach/television analyst/coke-rap enthusiast Doug Collins. By 1977 they were back in the NBA Finals, after purchasing the rights to ex-ABA superstar Julius Erving.


It’s impossible to say what these Sixers will look like four years from now. This year, at some point, the Sixers will win a game. It might happen on Wednesday night, when they play the rebuilding Boston Celtics, or on Saturday, when they visit the unquenchable tire fire that is the Knicks. But it won’t be pretty, and a lone victory (or even 10) won’t stop anyone from wondering if the Philadelphia 76ers are even dumber than they look, or if—in the words of Homer Simpson—Sam Hinkie is stupid like a fox.

Slate,L,Ball Aerospace: A company known for mason jars helped with NASA's Orion capsule.,"NASA’s great hope for future manned space exploration, the Orion capsule, was supposed to launch Thursday on its first test flight, but plans were scrapped because of various problems. The team will try again Friday morning. But when the capsule finally lifts off, it will bear the logos of the contractors who built it. Some of the names will be recognizable, like Lockheed Martin. Another logo will ring a bell, but it might seem out of place: the loopy script “Ball” embossed on mason jars the world over.

Today the 134-year-old Ball Corp. mostly makes cans: for soup and dog food, beer and soda, and aerosols. But the name is still most strongly associated with the glass jars the company became famous for. That business peaked in 1931, when Ball made 190 million jars (one for every person in the United States that year, with 66 million left over), and in 1993 the home-canning division was spun off into its own company.


    Advertisement




The capsule won’t be carrying canned tuna (or a bar trying to burnish its hipster cred). It’s taking instruments made by the Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., a division of Ball that pulled in about $900 million last year from contracts with NASA, the military, and other sources both public and private.*


Ball Aerospace started on a hunch. Ed Ball, son of one of the five founding Ball brothers, needed to find a way to keep his company profitable in the second half of the 20th century. The Ball company began selling tin cans for storing kerosene and went on to dominate the glass mason jar industry. By the end of World War II, with refrigeration replacing home canning, the company was scrambling. Ed proposed starting a research division to help Ball stay competitive.


Like many manufacturers, Ball had government contracts during World War II, making battery casings and other military equipment. That revenue evaporated after the war, but Ed Ball realized the new role government had taken on. In 1956, he wrote in a letter to some of his executives, “I understand that there are government projects available that might help our Research Department become self-supporting much more rapidly than pulling it up by its own bootstraps.”


Wanting to compete with larger corporations, but without the budget to build an in-house research department, Ed Ball did what anyone leading an aging tech giant would: He went looking for a start-up to buy. He convinced Ball’s board to invest in a Boulder, Colorado, company that made electronic scales for trucks.


The scale business quickly fizzled, but Ball’s outpost led to relationships with a group of physicists at the nearby University of Colorado. The newly formed Ball Brothers Research Corp. started hiring professors and graduate students away from the university, and their rocket-building contracts with them—drawing protest from the university president. Ed Ball was unapologetic.


“It was a kind of a faith. It was an instinctive decision that this company would benefit by having a research department that could sell its own work and that could also innovate for this aging, 80 year old glass company,” says Todd Neff, who wrote a book about the company’s 2005 Deep Impact mission. Ball Brothers Research, later renamed Ball Aerospace, was one of the first mouths at the spigot that funds the military-industrial complex.


Within a few years, the company had won its first NASA satellite contract. It went on to build a steady stream of spacecraft and instruments. In 1975 Ball won a patent for microstrip antennas, which were thin and flexible enough to mount on the curved hull of rockets. The company soon had contracts to make antennas for nuclear missiles and fighter jets. (When the much-maligned F-35 Lightning II finally enters service next year, it will have Ball Aerospace antennas integrated into its body.)


Along the way Ball Aerospace dabbled in Geiger counters and built a machine to make plastic bottles for the Ball Corp., but its roots were in government contracts, and that’s where the company found its success. Ninety-four percent of Ball’s business comes from government sources, with 28 percent of the total for the Pentagon and 20 percent split between NASA and NOAA. Ball Aerospace built instruments for Hubble (and fixed the telescope, too) and it is making the mirrors for Hubble’s replacement, the James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in 2018.


Now Ball finds itself needing to pivot again. “As [government agency] budgets have flattened over the last few years we’ve needed to look beyond some of our traditional markets,” says John Troeltzsch, a Ball program manager. His newest project is Sentinel, a space telescope intended to spot asteroids that could threaten Earth. Sentinel is being developed and funded by a nonprofit, the B612 Foundation, which was formed by a group of former astronauts, scientists, and engineers, including at least one person who formerly worked for Ball. Troeltzsch says it’s the first time that a nonprofit will develop a spacecraft.


Ball is turning its eyes overseas as well. It’s building a pollution-monitoring instrument for a Korean satellite, parlaying its experience as a NASA contractor. In the meantime, Ball Aerospace will continue as it has for most of its existence: overshadowed by its parent company and evocative logo, but making something a lot more exciting than mason jars.


*Correction, Dec. 4, 2014: This post originally misstated Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. as the Ball Aerospace & Technology Corp. It also stated that Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. made about $900 billion last year from contracts. It was $900 million.

Slate,L,"2014 World Series, Game 7: Should Alex Gordon have tried to dash home with the tying run?","After 29 years without a playoff berth, the Kansas City Royals went on a dream run that took them from the wild-card round to Game 7 of the World Series. And then Madison Bumgarner had to come along and spoil everything. Pitching in relief after throwing 117 pitches in Game 5, the Giants lefty threw another five scoreless innings to deliver the San Francisco Giants a 3–2 victory, clinching their third World Series title in five years. Bumgarner, the series MVP, has now allowed 1 earned run in 36 career World Series innings for an absurd 0.25 ERA.

While the Giants ace was close to unhittable, retiring 14 straight Kansas City hitters at one point, it wasn’t easy for Bumgarner to secure the last out. With San Francisco clinging to a one-run lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, the Royals’ Alex Gordon slapped a sinking liner. Giants center fielder Gregor Blanco misplayed it—badly. The ball skipped past Blanco all the way to the wall, where left fielder Juan Perez tried and failed to pick it up, then recovered and heaved it back toward the infield. After all those mistakes, it seemed like a disappointment when Gordon stopped at third, just 90 feet away from tying the game.

Moments later, catcher Salvador Perez fouled out weakly to third and the second-guessing began: Should Gordon have tried to make it home?


    Advertisement




Gordon, though not a burner, is a very good base runner. His savviness on the base paths, in fact, allowed the Royals to tie the game in the second inning after he advanced to third on a fly ball to left field, then scored on a sacrifice fly to center.


With regard to that ninth-inning scamper, though, Deadspin’s Tim Burke makes a strong case that Gordon would have been out by a mile at home. That certainly seems true given how long it took him to make it to third base. But it’s worth noting that the Royals left fielder wasn’t running as hard as he possibly could out of the box.


It’s a rule of thumb in baseball that a good runner should make it to first base in about 4.3 seconds. Based on Fox’s replays, it appears that Gordon made it to first in 4.5 seconds, then sped up once he saw the ball get past Blanco. It took Gordon around 12.2 seconds to make it to third, though he did slow down once the Royals’ third-base coach signaled that he shouldn’t run home.


A writer named Larry Granillo started tracking home run trot times in 2010. Since then, the fastest circuit of the bases by a major leaguer was by the Dodgers’ Dee Gordon (no relation to Alex), who did it in 13.89 seconds. The 10 next fastest times were all under 14.66 seconds, which Gordon certainly wouldn't have matched if he'd churned his legs toward home. In fairness, even if he was running full out from the instant he made contact, it's unlikely Gordon could've raced home in the neighborhood of 14.5 seconds, though it's impossible to say what World Series adrenaline could’ve brought out of him.


Back in reality: If Gordon had tried to stretch his hit into four bases, he would have been rounding the bag as the throw hit cutoff man Brandon Crawford in shallow left. That means, basically, that any decent throw cuts him down, ending the World Series. If Crawford’s hypothetical toss home is horribly off line, the Royals tie the game and Kansas City goes crazy.


The smart play, then, is probably to hold Gordon at third—put up the stop sign and give Salvador Perez a chance to drive him in. But I wish we could’ve seen Gordon charging home, Crawford’s throw coming in, and Buster Posey waiting at the plate. Now that would be an amazing way to decide the World Series—and I’m sure we would’ve had an amazing argument about it after Gordon (probably) got thrown out at home.

Update, Oct. 30, 2014, 3:20 p.m.: MLB.com has posted a fantastic bird’s-eye video that shows that Gordon never reached top speed on his ninth-inning jaunt around the bases. Andrew Simon reports that Gordon’s max speed of 18.7 miles per hour didn’t match the top-end velocity of 20.3 miles per hour that he reached when running the bases earlier in the game.

Slate,L,"Whole Foods Detroit: Can a grocery store really fight elitism, racism, and obesity?","A couple of years ago, as winter gave way to spring, Toyoda Ruff began to think about changing how she ate. Ruff had always been heavy, but her son, Tarik, a freshman honor student, had recently crossed the 300-pound mark, prompting Ruff to ferry him to appointments at a children’s weight loss clinic, 11 miles away in Detroit’s Midtown neighborhood, and to document everything he ate for two months. At 270 pounds, her husband, Jermaine Harris, wanted to slim down, too. Ruff was beginning to see her family’s weekly fast-food habit and visits to Golden Corral’s all-you-can-eat buffet as a problem.

As Ruff mulled over these changes, a friend cajoled her into joining a healthy cooking class at their church. Ruff was on medical leave from her job as a probation officer due to an injury, and the break gave her time to consider her meals. The more she thought about eating healthy, the more intrigued she was by a new store: Whole Foods, which had just opened in Detroit. “It was on the news. People were talking about it at church,” Ruff said. “Everybody was talking about it.”


That included people outside of Detroit, too. As the city neared bankruptcy, national media questioned why a grocer derided as “Whole Paycheck”—a nod to the chain’s longstanding strategy of charging a premium for organic, local, and sustainable food—would open a store there. Whole Foods’ answer was even more surprising: The store, said company leaders, was about social equity as much as profit.

“We’re coming to confront the disconnect between the accessibility and the affordability in healthy food,” declared Walter Robb, the co-CEO of Whole Foods, in an early 2012 address to Detroit business leaders. There would be lower prices, too, to make the store accessible to “all of Detroit.” Robb’s nod to the growing dietary gap between rich and poor was surprising for a man leading a company known for appealing to white, monied foodies. That April, he went even further. Addressing corporate leaders at the Milken Institute Global Conference, Robb said that at the Detroit store “we’re going after elitism. We’re going after racism.” And real success, Robb told me later, would include seeing that “health outcomes are being improved” in Detroit.


Those were big goals for any supermarket, but they were especially a stretch for Whole Foods. First lady Michelle Obama’s initiative to open new supermarkets in order to expand access to healthy foods has made it commonplace for grocers to talk about health, but it is unusual for grocers to talk about lowering prices to make healthy food more accessible. Whole Foods would almost certainly need to do that in Detroit, where more than one-third of the city lives below the poverty line. What’s more, Whole Foods’ central conceit as a company is that it sells only the best, healthiest food—which sometimes requires paying more. The Detroit store marked the grocer’s first big experiment testing whether lower-income shoppers like Ruff—a public employee with a master’s degree in social work, she is roughly middle class but sometimes struggles to pay her bills—would find that line of reasoning persuasive.



Empty, savage, and foodless: This was Detroit’s reputation when Robb first went there.



As Whole Foods prepared to open in Detroit in June 2013 tension over the city’s future was becoming palpable. Historically, racial and income inequality have broken down along the city limits, with poor, black residents in the city and rich, white residents in the suburbs, said John Patrick Leary, an assistant professor of English at Wayne State University in Detroit who frequently writes about the city’s equity issues. But as middle- and upper-class residents have moved to the city while the poor stayed poor, he said, Detroit was “becoming more of a normal city like Chicago or New York, where the superficial trappings of middle-class life are concentrated in a place where you can pretend you’re surrounded by it.” Would the store serve the audience Robb implied: the city’s working class and poor, nearly all of them black, constituting the majority of the city? Or would it fall back on its base, and just serve the influx of upwardly mobile, mostly white professionals and creatives?


Before Ruff’s first visit to Whole Foods last June, she wasn’t sure what to expect. Usually, she shopped at Aldi’s, a discount store where it took a quarter to unlock a shopping cart, and entering the store required walking past an aisle stacked 6 feet high with cookies and budget wine. For produce, she went to Randazzo’s, a local Italian market. Ruff expected Whole Foods to be a cross between Randazzo’s and Sam’s Club. When she walked in she was surprised and overwhelmed.


“It’s kind of intimidating to go in there and shop,” Ruff told me. “I just kind of walked around, but a lot of the stuff didn’t appeal to me,” she said. She didn’t see much difference—besides price—between Whole Foods’ groceries and what she bought at Aldi’s. And while many shoppers were black, as is Ruff, nearly everyone wore professional or stylish attire (or hospital scrubs); she was in a T-shirt and sweats.


Ruff was impressed, but baffled, too. She was looking for affordable, healthy food, and when she saw the salad and juice bars, the café area, the parade of samples, they seemed excessive. That first visit to Whole Foods “was like if you would go to a football game, and you’ve never been, and you have no clue as to what you’re watching,” said Ruff, who coached her sons’ pee wee football teams. “And you’re just sitting there like, ‘What the hell is going on?’ ”

The Odd Couple



To understand what led Whole Foods to put a grocery store in Detroit, you need to understand three things: The city’s reputation, its officials’ interest in changing it, and, most of all, Whole Foods’ larger aspirations.


When Robb first began eyeing Detroit in 2009, the city was mostly known for crime, abandonment, and being a place from which, as one NPR broadcast said, “grocers flee.” Dateline NBC’s Chris Hansen compared Detroit to “some ravaged foreign nation” and portrayed residents hunting raccoons for food. “There are more than 400 liquor stores in Detroit. But if you want to buy food, good luck,” he said, adding—erroneously—that the city held just eight supermarkets, all of them discount stores. Empty, savage, and foodless: This was Detroit’s reputation when Robb first went there.

            }
        });
         

Indeed, Robb might never have considered opening a store in Detroit if he hadn’t had lunch with Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a personal friend, on a trip to Washington, D.C., shortly after President Obama—and Vilsack—took office. Robb had been paying attention to studies around food access, and watched the first lady’s initial steps around food issues with interest; maybe, he thought, Whole Foods had a role to play. When he mentioned this to Vilsack, the secretary said he had recently met with a group of black ministers from Detroit who were asking for help addressing grocery store access in their city. He offered to put Robb in touch with city officials.


Robb arrived in Detroit a few weeks later. It was January, cold and bleak, and city officials eagerly made their case as they gave him a tour. Where Robb went to Detroit to bridge the gap in food access between rich and poor, Detroit’s city planners saw Whole Foods as a way to not only serve its longstanding middle class, but to expand it. In short, they wanted the store to serve as a catalyst for gentrification. Whole Foods was more than a potential employer for the 15 percent of Detroiters who were unemployed (and the 46 percent who’d stopped looking for work entirely);⁠ and it was more than a new option for the Detroiters spending $200 million a year on groceries outside the city. It was, in the words of the city’s economic development head, a potential “game-changer” for the city.

“Food’s a Great Lens, but It’s Not the Actual Topic We Need to Address”

“Gentrification brings in revenue. That’s the tax base that we need to pay for city services,” George Jackson, the president of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, told me in the summer of 2013. (After a new mayor assumed office in January 2014, Jackson resigned.) For DEGC, a quasi-public agency in charge of overseeing economic strategy for the city, Whole Foods’ allure was less about groceries and more about development. A successful premium grocer would make Detroit more appealing to middle-class and upper-class professionals—and to executives looking for a viable place to do business—helping the city as a whole.


That calculation was central to the city’s controversial decision to coordinate $5.8 million in public subsidies and private grants for the developer Whole Foods had selected to build the store. That was enough to bring the store’s rent down to $6 a square foot, according to internal documents obtained by reporters at a local community paper, the Chaldean News (and shared with Slate). The rent, which was less than one-third of market rates last summer, served as a kind of insurance for Whole Foods, whose initial sales projections suggested that Detroit was a losing proposition. With rent that low, the store would make money even if the models were right, and sales were dismal.

            }
        });
         

The store opened in June 2013 at the southern border of Midtown, a rebranded neighborhood that used to be known as the Cass Corridor, the city’s roughest skid row. Despite being in a city built for cars, the Whole Foods is an unusually walkable destination. Sitting at the corner of Mack and Woodward, it is across the street from the symphony, a block from an expanding medical complex (including Ruff’s son’s weight loss clinic), and a 15-minute walk from three college campuses. And, because it sits within five minutes of every freeway, it is also an easy stop for suburban commuters. From the store’s entryway, you cannot see any of the nearby signs of Detroit’s older reputation: burned out apartment buildings and vacant lots where the homeless gather, a check cashing joint adjacent to a liquor store. One black resident of Midtown, a marketer, compared his neighborhood’s relationship with the rest of the city to the protected section of Baghdad during the Iraq war. Midtown, he told me, is Detroit’s “Green Zone.”


Yet, to hear Robb tell it, Whole Foods also hoped to find customers outside the “college graduates and foodies” that Robb’s co-CEO, the prominent libertarian John Mackey, told me make up its traditional market base. The Midtown store is the first of several that Whole Foods is opening in mixed-to-low income neighborhoods around the country; one opened in New Orleans’ Mid-City earlier this year, and the retailer has planned stores for Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood and downtown Newark, New Jersey. When Robb and I spoke on the phone a month after the Detroit store opened, he told me “the mission of this store is to serve all Detroiters,” a group that would necessarily include the poor. And while Robb’s story of the Detroit store tends toward lofty ideals, there’s also a strong business imperative to expand the corporation’s customer base: an expansion goal of reaching 1,200 stores—nearly triple its current count—by 2020.


To succeed at Robb’s goal of reaching all Detroiters—whether for idealistic reasons of equity, or savvy ones of expanding its customer base—Whole Foods needed to do more than just turn a profit. It needed to persuade a new kind of customer that what it sold—local, organic, and sustainable—was worth seeking out. It needed, in other words, to change the food culture among the poor (or at least poorer), just as it has done among the affluent.

Apples to Apples



The second time Toyoda Ruff went to Whole Foods, she was hoping to glean a little advice. One of the biggest lessons she’d taken from the cooking class at her church, she said, was that she could afford a better diet. “When I took the cooking class I realized that … it doesn’t always have to be so expensive to eat healthy,” she said, and she was always looking for deals. So when she heard that Whole Foods was offering classes on how to shop its stores on a budget, she persuaded her friend from church, Sharon Williams, to come along.

            }
        });
         

On a pleasant August afternoon, the two women piled into Ruff’s creaking Altima and drove the 11 miles from northwest Detroit to Midtown. A little after 2 p.m., they walked down a celery-green hall on the grocer’s second floor, passed a door marked “Zen Room,” and entered the classroom. Four conference tables had been pushed together, and around them sat 11 women, all but one of them black. Nearly everyone was eating the Whole Foods–brand crudités and chips that had been set out. At the front of the room stood Amanda Musilli.



“People said, well, how do you expect Detroiters to afford this?”
Amanda Musilli, community liaison for Whole Foods



“Our class today is about savvy shopping,” she began, gesturing at a PowerPoint on a wall-mounted flatscreen television. White, trim, and plainly dressed, with long brown hair and low-top Converse sneakers, Musilli had moved to Detroit in 2011 to develop community partnerships for Whole Foods, attending city council meetings and doing ground-level outreach like teaching the budgeting class—which she’d started holding two years before opening day in a storefront office.


Earlier in the year, Musilli and I had discussed city residents’ initial response to the idea of the store. “People said, well, how do you expect Detroiters to afford this?” Musilli told me. “Many times those were not Detroiters, and those were white people saying ‘How are those people going to afford your food?’ ” There is such a stark hostility between the city’s affluent suburbs and Detroit, that it seemed possible that unnamed white suburbanites had sneered at Detroiters’ interest in Whole Foods. But it also was possible, I thought, that Musilli was telling this story to deflect attention from discussions of price.


“I do want to start this talk about what’s different here, because when comparing prices of things, it’s only fair to compare apples to apples,” Musilli said at the August class, standing at the front of the room. “It’s not a fair comparison to compare our grass-fed, organic beef to factory-farmed beef.” The class waited wordlessly for her to continue, and Musilli listed the ingredients Whole Foods prohibits in food it sells: high fructose corn syrup; artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives; irradiated foods; MSG. Whole Foods’ 365 brand didn’t contain GMOs, either, she added, deftly introducing the store’s private label. “Now I don’t know if you guys know that genetically modified organisms are a concern,” she said. “We can talk about that. By 2018 … every product will be labeled and it’s going to be similar to a cigarette label, that this product may contain genetically modified organisms.” There was more friendly silence.


This general argument—a soft-pedaled version of “You get what you pay for”—is at the heart of Whole Foods’ marketing, especially its extensive new “Values Matter” campaign. But it can be a tough sell for anyone whose finances are tight. After the class, Ruff told me she was open to paying at least slightly higher prices for certain things. Leaner meats might be more expensive, but they were healthier, and she was trying to learn how to balance those things out. “It makes you feel good when you feed your family healthy stuff instead of junk,” Ruff had told me earlier in the summer.

        requirejs([""jquery""], function($) {
            if ($(window).width() < 640) {
                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

As Musilli ran through her presentation, she transitioned from her “apples to apples” argument to concrete shopping tips. Little of the advice she offered would surprise anyone who already watches their budget. On a post-class tour, she counseled her students to buy whole pineapples for $2.99 each rather than pay $3.29 for a pint of pre-cut chunks; to ignore the attractive, full-price cheddar displayed next to apples that were on sale; to compare prices per ounce rather than per package in the grocery aisle. But she also frequently reminded her students that Whole Foods wasn’t just about deals, but value. At the meat counter, where boneless chicken breasts were priced $4.99 a pound, she said “it’s unfair to talk about price … if we’re not talking about quality.” When a student exclaimed at the $2.99 price for a dozen 365-brand eggs, Musilli observed that the chickens had never been in cages.


After the class broke up, Ruff, Williams, and I wandered the store, casually comparing selection and prices to what the two women said they found at Aldi’s and Save-a-Lot, where they usually shopped. We paused to look at a display of 365-brand organic applesauce cup six-packs. Ruff narrowed her eyes at the $2.99 price tag.


“For a dollar, you can get four of them at Aldi’s,” she said, referring not to the same brand, but packaged applesauce cups. Here, at Whole Foods, they were 50 cents each; at Aldi’s, 25 cents. Ruff examined the nutrition label: 11 grams of sugar. “That’s a lot,” she said to Williams.


“That’s what we learned in our other class, that you really got to pay attention to that,” said Williams.


“It’s saying low-sodium, no sugar added,” said Ruff doubtfully.


“That means it’s natural from the apples.”


“Natural sugar is better. So …” Ruff scanned the ingredient list. “It just say apples. OK. Cool.”


“That’s really cool,” said Williams.


“See, I would buy my kids this,” said Ruff. “Even though it’s a little more expensive.” Ruff ended up buying a bag of frozen edamame and some almond milk, foods Tarik’s doctor had suggested as a way to boost nutrients with modest calorie burdens. “I just figured I would pick it up, but I didn’t see anything else that was interesting,” Ruff told me later. “That was the thing. I didn’t see anything else that I really would have gotten from there that I couldn’t get for a little cheaper from another store.”

            }
        });
         

Listening to Ruff and Williams, I got the impression that Musilli’s pitch about value had fallen flat. While Ruff wanted her family to eat a healthy diet, she wasn’t buying the premise that lies at the heart of Whole Foods’ ideology and marketing: that organic, non-GMO, and corn-syrup-free foods are inherently healthier than the alternative. When it came to grocery shopping, both women subscribed to basic nutrition guidelines that haven’t changed much in generations: less fat, sugar, and salt, more fruits and vegetables.


“To just go completely organic seems crazy to me,” said Ruff. “If it was a little cheaper, if it was the same price as the other stuff, maybe. But to me, it’s overpriced.” Her usual rule of thumb for determining quality was more pragmatic than the criteria listed by Musilli: “As long as it’s not spoiled, molded, or expired, I’m good with it.”

Whole Paycheck vs. “the Whole Community”



There seem to be few things that irk Whole Foods representatives more than the phrase “Whole Paycheck,” a phrase that I remember Robb casually mentioning to me as an annoyance more than once. His dislike of the phrase was the first thing that came to mind when, on the Detroit store’s opening day, Robb invited me to sit down, looked at me unblinkingly and said that if Whole Foods felt my story wasn’t going in the direction they wanted, he would stop cooperating.


Whether they knew the moniker or not, one of Detroiters’ worries about Whole Foods before it opened was price, which ranked as a top concern when the company solicited community input about the store. In my early conversations with Whole Foods for this article, I heard a lot about how prices were key to making the store accessible to residents; how the Detroit store was trying to counter its reputation for sticker-shock by limiting wine prices to $20, the same per-pound limit it set for meat; and how, in Robb’s words, those changes meant the store could serve “all of Detroit.” Even as Musilli tried to persuade shoppers like Ruff that cage-free eggs were worth the higher price, Robb was making the slightly contradictory case to reporters like me that Whole Foods’ prices were competitive with other stores.



There are few things that irk Whole Foods representatives more than the phrase “Whole Paycheck.”



Yet what you think of Whole Foods prices depends largely on what you consider “competitive.” When the Detroit store opened, it featured prices that were, compared to their usual prices, great deals: local, nonorganic collards were 99 cents a bunch, compared to $2.49 a bunch for organic collards at a Whole Foods in the suburbs of Detroit. And the hot food and salad bars cost $6.99 a pound instead of the usual $8.99.


But it is hard to see how a cheaper salad bar would help someone stretch his or her food dollar—or food stamps. And though the collards seemed an unusually cheap option for Whole Foods, where they were displayed atop rustic wooden crates, it wasn’t clear how their price compared to other stores in Detroit. I wanted to know more about that: How did Whole Foods compare when it came to basic staples for a Detroiter on a budget, things like eggs, yogurt, peanut butter, and cereal?


When I asked Whole Foods for a list of its competitive prices last summer, the company declined to provide one, so I compiled a list of 40 common grocery items and documented their prices at both the Detroit Whole Foods and King Cole, a neighborhood grocer in Detroit’s North End neighborhood. I borrowed Whole Foods’ preferred framework of comparing “like to like”—in other words, comparing organic items to each other—but I also checked the stores “price to price,” comparing the cheapest options available as a way of approximating the experience of a budget-conscious shopper. Based on my findings, if you were like Ruff and prioritized price, switching from King Cole to Whole Foods for groceries would cost 29 percent more for the full list of 40 items. If, on the other hand, a shopper agreed with Musilli and was willing to pay for the “value” offered by organic, Whole Foods was the clear winner, mostly because organic was an expensive rarity at King Cole, which only stocked three organic items, all more expensive than at Whole Foods.


Across the board, Whole Foods was much more competitive on price for packaged items like cereal and pasta sauce than for produce, meat, and dairy—fresh items that Whole Foods often sells only organic versions of. Packaged items at Whole Foods were about 11 percent more expensive than at King Cole; fresh were 53 percent more expensive. Those disparities have shifted slightly over the last year; when I updated prices this past September, fresh items were 58 percent more expensive at Whole Foods, packaged items 4 percent. (These findings contradict the general thrust of several recent articles touting Whole Foods’ affordability.) And while Whole Foods is experimenting with lowering its prices on produce in its flagship store in Austin, the degree of the price cuts remains unclear. At the prices I saw this fall, it’s hard to see how eating a healthy diet, with lots of produce, would be an affordable option if you were to shop primarily at Whole Foods. (To get a sense of what different items cost at four Detroit-area grocery stores—King Cole, a suburban Walmart, the Detroit Whole Foods, and a suburban Whole Foods—play around with the following interactive shopping cart of basic grocery staples based on prices I collected in September, or download the entire data set with prices, brand names, and category comparisons.)

When I discussed Whole Foods’ pricing with Robb in January, he repeated something I’d heard him say many times: that Whole Foods was “competitive” on price. I agreed with Robb that Whole Foods was the cheapest place in Detroit for organics, but pointed out that it could be more expensive to do all your grocery shopping there than at neighborhood grocers. Robb said he took issue with the idea that Whole Foods was more expensive than other stores. “I don’t agree with your premise there,” he said, bristling. “Whole Foods, on like-to-like items, and on basic staples, is very competitive, in any market.”


A few days later, I sent Whole Foods the price comparisons I’d gathered, asking if Robb could address the question I’d been trying to ask: What about doing all your grocery shopping at Whole Foods, not just buying select items, given these numbers? How competitive did Whole Foods see itself in that context? Within a couple days, Whole Foods sent me their own version of the list, on which the tallies had shifted: The prices for Whole Foods had dropped, and those for King Cole had risen, shrinking the markup for Whole Foods from 29 to 8 percent. When I explained that I could not use Whole Foods’ data on its competitors’ prices, Whole Foods declined to answer further questions for the story. When I pressed the issue in October, a spokesperson, Kate Lowery, told me my study was “not accurate,” but declined to explain further.


I was surprised by Whole Foods’ refusal to engage in a direct conversation about price. In my earlier conversations with Robb, he had agreed that past criticism of the store for high prices had been deserved, and he spoke eloquently about wanting to increase demand for healthier food, which he saw Whole Foods as well positioned to meet. But whenever I observed that it costs more to shop for all one’s groceries there, he repeated the mantra that Whole Foods was competitive on like-to-like items, and changed the subject to quality.


“The cheapest food is not always the best deal for you, from the health perspective. Yes, you can buy cheaper food than what we offer at Whole Foods, but there’s often a trade off,” said Robb, echoing Musilli. “I don’t know how to tell you the difference between pink slime and beef that’s been raised to our standards. It’s not the same product, but is it worth it to you?”


Whole Foods had a plan to make that case across the city. Not through newspaper circulars or television ads, not even through city officials. Instead, the grocer had brought to Detroit its own healthy eating ambassador.

The Ambassador



The first time I saw Dr. Akua Woolbright lecture, she was in front of a crowd of about 60 people, most of them black, sitting in Sacred Heart Church on a hot, rainy summer night. Early on, Woolbright warned her audience that, as a nutritionist, she would not be advocating incremental dietary change because, “you would never say, ‘Well, it’s okay, you can kind of kill people—but do it in moderation.’ ” The crowd laughed, warming to Woolbright, who began the talk by introducing herself as the granddaughter of a rural Texas preacher and farmer.

                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

Woolbright’s ability to speak authentically in the vernaculars of the black church, holistic healers (of whom there were several at the church), and sustainable foodies—and to translate between them—make her a natural emissary for Whole Foods in Detroit. As the store’s nutritionist, she started offering classes there in 2012, a year before the store opened. She began visiting weekly from Austin, and was so taken with the city that she moved to Detroit that fall with her son. She taught classes in high schools and community centers, urging people to eat diets based on whole ingredients, dense nutrients, healthy fats, and plant-based food. Her job, Woolbright told me, was not to promote Whole Foods but to encourage healthy diets, though I noticed she sometimes failed to separate the two. Her church lecture closely tracked Health Starts Here, an in-store health promotion program, and, while Woolbright focused on food advice, she peppered the talk with casual references to the company. Still, Woolbright was persuasive when she spoke about her work: “It’s personal to me. I want to do this work anyway,” she told me. “[Whole Foods’] mission and my mission are the same thing.”


In the weeks after the store opened, Woolbright began to offer in-store hours, and so on a bright Saturday morning last summer, I spent a few hours chatting with her at a high wooden table in the bulk foods section. We had been there for about an hour when a heavyset black woman named Spencer Torry Brown, wearing sweats and an Air Jordan T-shirt, paused in front of the table. Brown’s cart held a few wrapped packages from the meat counter and a metal cane.


“She told me you could help me,” said Brown, gesturing to a woman at the meat counter. Woolbright nodded and Brown began, without prompting, to list her health problems: epileptic seizures, diabetes, COPD. She didn’t drive. She had recently found herself eating cookies and chain smoking until the wee hours of the morning. “I’m not eating the right foods, I’m eating those Oreos,” she told me later, shaking her head. “I am. I’m going through them mothers like …” Her voice trailed off, incredulous and embarrassed. “And I say to myself, something’s wrong … I have to stop. So that’s why I’m here.”


Woolbright listened to Brown thoughtfully, then disappeared into the aisles, returning with an armful of food and a game plan. She held up a can of McCann’s steel-cut oats. “In the morning you have to put something bulky, heavy in your stomach. If you don’t weigh it down you will continue to crave high calorie foods.” She suggested making a big pot of oats on Sundays, and eating from that during the week, sweetening it with bananas or maple syrup. More advice followed: Canned beans, no sodium added, are a quick way to fill up. Whole wheat pasta cooks quickly and has whole grains. Oats were good for a green smoothie; she recommended buying a NutriBullet blender at Walmart. Brown nodded appreciatively and promised to email Woolbright if she had more questions, but she left the beans and oatmeal behind.


The changes Woolbright suggested weren’t complicated, but I had a hard time seeing even myself making them. The idea of reheating porridge for the week was distinctly unappealing. Buying a $100 blender for breakfast smoothies seemed unrealistic, particularly for someone living, as Brown did, on disability checks.


On that first visit to Whole Foods, Brown didn’t buy the store’s organic cookies or other junk food, but she didn’t heed much of Woolbright’s advice, either. As I accompanied her through the store, Brown seemed excited by the options before her. She bought Balinese barbecue tofu salad from the deli, a rotisserie chicken, turkey patties with spinach, chicken shish kebabs, a peach smoothie, and—in a nod to Woolbright’s advice—some produce, including five non-organic bananas. It all looked fresh, delicious, and wholesome, but the total came to $66.05, about one-third of Brown’s monthly grocery budget. With discipline, I guessed, it could cover lunch and dinner for about a week.

The food she bought, I told her later, seemed expensive, but Brown shrugged it off. “You know, I don’t worry about expensive sometimes,” she told me later. “I mean, it can’t be over $20, but if it’s like $2 …” she paused. “I’m not a scaredy person as far as buying something.” As Brown talked, it was hard not to hear an echo of Musilli: She wanted to eat healthy foods, and she felt willing to pay more for it when she could. I got the sense that, for Brown, feeling she was both making a healthy decision and treating herself had proved irresistible.

It was difficult to get Brown to talk for long about either supermarkets or changing her habits. Instead, discussions that started off with a grocery store quickly veered off course, derailed by the problems that preceded any thoughts Brown had about health. Without a car, unable to walk far, and living in a city with unreliable public transit, Brown mostly took cabs or depended on friends and family with cars. Her medications included prednisone, a steroid that made her ravenous. (She blamed it for her Oreo binges.) When Brown moved this spring, her new apartment in Hamtramck had no stove, further limiting her meal options.


Brown shared this list of obstacles nearly every time I asked her whether she had followed Woolbright’s advice. Sometimes she would talk about how much she had liked Woolbright, but after a phone consultation last summer, when Brown took down some notes about shopping, she said they hadn’t been in touch. When Brown moved, she lost the scrap of paper on which she’d written down Woolbright’s advice.



Most days it felt easier, more predictable, less likely to result in failure, to just keep doing what she was doing.



Brown was obese and unhappy about it. “I don’t want to be this way; I don’t,” she told me. But it was difficult to see grocery stores as a primary factor in her weight problem. On one visit last summer, her breakfast had been white bread, turkey, Miracle Whip, and mustard, an attempt at following Woolbright’s suggestion to eat lean meats. Though that sandwich was not a kale salad, it was also not a Big Mac and fries. When I returned this fall, I asked Brown how she was doing with following Woolbright’s advice, and she showed me to a lidless Tupperware in her refrigerator with corn kernels and green beans. “I’m a veggie person, really. I like broccoli and beans and corn,” she said. What little other food she had looked nominally healthy: chicken thighs, eggs, cheese slices, a jug of water, and a jug of Minute Maid punch (three for $5 at her neighborhood supermarket), condiments in the door. The problem, she said, was her sweet tooth. Last summer, it had been the Oreos; this year, money was tighter, so it was pancakes and syrup.


What seemed to be tripping Brown up wasn’t knowledge about nutrition so much as a debilitating sense that anything she tried to change—what she ate, how she spent her days—could spiral out of control, whether because of depression or finances or transport or health. Going to the store meant worrying about getting someone to drive her, she told me, and once there she had to worry about the driver getting upset with her for taking too long. Then she had to worry about trying to cook—she had only a microwave and a George Foreman grill—and even so she couldn’t stand long enough to cook much, anyway. At nearly 300 pounds, getting to a healthy weight felt insurmountable. Most days it felt easier, more predictable, less likely to result in failure, to just keep doing what she was doing.


It can be tempting to disparage Brown for her tendency to get overwhelmed by the myriad issues—health, transport, money—that she faced, but recent research suggests that it’s a problem common across all levels of education and social class. “When you are struggling with lots on your mind, that just leaves less mind for other things in everyday life,” said Eldar Shafir, a behavioral researcher at Princeton University. Shafir calls this tendency “bandwidth poverty,” which he and Harvard economist Sendhil Mullainathan documented in multiple experiments for their book, Scarcity. Whenever most people face multiple problems at once, they focus on the most urgent one—and may do fairly well with it. But when it comes to everything else, said Shafir, there’s just not enough brainpower to go around. “You’re going to get both depleted and distracted, and forgetful, and not do things exactly right,” said Shafir. It is easy to see an example of that in the way that Brown had shopped so healthfully after speaking with Woolbright—yet budgeted so poorly.


Brown told me she visited Whole Foods twice last year. She liked that it was clean and pretty and bright, that she could sit down, have a nice snack, maybe meet people. She liked its wholesome, healthy aura. None of that was true of Walmart or her local supermarket or the corner store where she bought cookies. “Whole Foods is great,” said Brown. “It make you feel … it put you in a right perspective of yourself being healthy.” What she liked about Whole Foods, it turned out, were the same things that middle-class people liked.

            }
        });
         

When Woolbright and I discussed Brown’s shopping trip, I commented that Brown had bought food that looked healthy, but was fairly expensive. “Right, right,” said Woolbright. “That’s a different question,” she said, shifting our discussion from cost to quality. “We’re not talking about expense right now, we’re talking about nutrition choices,” she said. Her role as a nutritionist, as she saw it, was to give Brown information about the healthiest choices she could make; it wasn’t any of her business to tell Brown how to prioritize her budget.


“People make assumptions about, ‘Oh, they’re on welfare. I can’t believe they bought bottled water’ ” or other expensive things, said Woolbright. “I don’t make those assumptions for people.” I heard an echo of Musilli’s story about white suburbanites’ assumptions about Detroit. There was merit to what Woolbright said, but Whole Foods seemed to have settled on a media strategy of deflecting questions about price by suggesting that it is paternalistic, if not classist and racist, to ask whether its food is affordable to the poor.


If you do ask that question, though, you find that the healthiest foods at Whole Foods—the produce, the meat, the dairy—are all sold at prices that exclude the poor, Brown included, from regularly shopping there. Whatever “value” Whole Foods may offer, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that a company selling “healthier” food at a 29 percent markup widens the class divide in diet and health rather than narrowing it.


Still, Woolbright was right about desire. “I feel like people want to do better; they want to do better,” she said. This was clearly true of Brown: She wanted to eat, and feel, better—and she saw Whole Foods as a way to do both when, and if, she could afford it.

The $6 Cupcake



This September, Toyoda Ruff settled into an upholstered chair while her husband finished his dinner: a mound of lettuce, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Ruff was planning to eat later, probably some vegetable-beef soup she had made over the weekend. “I’ve been to the Whole Foods stores a couple of times—the almond milk, the stuff that was on sale,” said Ruff, holding a toddler nephew on her lap. “But I didn’t really pick up the meat or a lot of the vegetables, they were kind of expensive,” she said; she still favored Aldi’s. Of Whole Foods, said Ruff, “That’s the bourgie store,” she said. “I just wonder how many people come from the ‘hood and go shopping at Whole Foods’ store. I bet you it’s not a lot.”

            }
        });
         

I was curious about that, too. Knowing how many of Whole Foods’ customers were actually poor would give an indication of the progress Whole Foods had made toward its goal of serving “all Detroiters.” In January, I asked Whole Foods how their Detroit store’s sales from SNAP—food stamps—compared to the company’s other stores; nearby independent grocers had told me 75, even 80, percent of their sales came from SNAP. Though Whole Foods declined to share specific numbers, Robb did say that SNAP sales in Detroit were an impressive five or six times the chain’s average, suggesting they had reached more of the poor than at their other stores. A source who was familiar with the Detroit store and its initial sales performance, and who declined to be named for professional reasons, told me that Whole Food averages about 1 or 2 percent of sales from SNAP nationwide. If both Robb and my source are correct, 5 to 12 percent of Whole Foods’ Detroit sales are from SNAP. Since 38 percent of Detroit residents make use of the SNAP program, this estimate suggests the store isn’t reaching a cross section of the city, but a targeted, upper-income niche.



The lesson from Whole Foods in Detroit may well be that the problem is not food, but poverty.



Indeed, last summer, when all the numbers had been crunched after the opening crush of business, the store found itself considering selling more expensive items, not cheaper ones. The top seller in the bakery department had been a single cupcake, baked in a half-pint jar. It sold for $6. Customers had been asking for more lamb, better cuts of meat, and higher quality wine. The busiest time at the store, Banks told me, was lunch hour, when office workers flooded the store—it is one of the few places for quick take-out within walking distance of the medical complex next door. Last November the store added a breakfast bar with $5 breakfast burritos. By autumn, bottles of wine topped out at $42, and meats at $30 per pound, instead of $20. This slide toward higher prices suggests that Whole Foods was having more success with its traditional customers than with lower-income ones.


None of this repudiates the idea that Whole Foods is a broadly positive thing for Detroit. In addition to a grocery store, the city got the gentrification signifier that it sought. Development in Midtown—and elsewhere in the city—has continued to expand, and local officials have told me Whole Foods’ success has made it easier to persuade companies to give Detroit a try. At last count, the store had created 180 jobs with wages well above the federal and state minimums. Robb has spent his own money in town, paying for new signs at the farmer’s market, persuading his suppliers to donate $150,000 in equipment to a commercial kitchen for food entrepreneurs, and hosted a benefit to raise money for the project. Even Ruff and Brown, who have little use for the store, told me they are glad it’s there.


In strictly financial terms, Whole Foods has succeeded in Detroit. Sales there have been double the initial projections, and despite Whole Foods’ reputation as a store for wealthy whites, my visits to the store suggest that its customer base reflects the fact that Detroit is majority black. When Robb was in Detroit this past September for a conference to drum up corporate interest in the city, he said the chain is looking to open a second store there.

            }
        });
         

But if you consider Robb’s broader initial goals—to reach families just trying to eat healthier, to make truly healthy food truly accessible to a broad swath of the city, to tackle the class divide in health—Whole Foods hasn’t gotten very far. Robb’s eloquent talk aside, Whole Foods isn’t too preoccupied with finding a market among shoppers like Ruff and Williams, for whom the pitch that cage-free and genetically modified are healthier than other food doesn’t merit the markup. Shoppers wanting simple, affordable healthy food, rather than an aspirational product, have better options elsewhere. And for indisputably poor people like Brown, who aspire to buy what Whole Foods sells, the prices simply aren’t low enough to work. This is not to call into question the sincerity of Robb’s desire to improve health outcomes in Detroit, but rather the impracticality—if not disingenuousness—of tying such a broad social goal to a marketing plan that requires, by definition, spending 29 percent more on your groceries. For anyone looking to address health and diet disparities, the lesson from Whole Foods in Detroit may well be that the problem is not food, but poverty. And that is a problem that requires more than a supermarket to solve.

Truthfully, that is something that Robb knows. When I last talked to Robb, in January, I believed him when he told me he was troubled by the “the idea that health is, somehow, the province of the rich—which it’s not,” and how the “disparity [in access to healthy food] is unacceptable from a moral perspective.” Those things, I told him, troubled me, too.


I asked Robb what that meant for Whole Foods, where grocery shopping was more expensive. “Ultimately customers get to choose. It’s a free market, and we’re going to present our choices, and then people are going to decide if they’re worth it or not,” said Robb. Ruff, Brown, the rest of Detroit, even the rest of America—all were welcome to peruse the aisles and decide whether the grass-fed beef was worth the markup over pink slime. “You know, we’re not miracle workers,” Robb told me. “We’re just a grocer.”

Slate,L,"Cleveland police, Justice Department: Systemic use of excessive force. ","Attorney general Eric Holder announced today that a federal investigation of nearly 600 incidents involving Cleveland officers indicates that the city's police department systematically uses excessive force. The investigation was opened in March 2013, well predating the recent killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by Cleveland officer Tim Loehmann. From Cleveland.com:

The investigation by six Justice Department lawyers, plus several independent policing experts, found that systemic deficiencies and practices haunt the city's police department. The problems include insufficient accountability, inadequate training, ineffective policies, and inadequate engagement with the community, according to a 58-page letter given to Jackson...
The investigation was prompted by the 2012 deaths of two unarmed suspects who were killed in ""a hail of 137 bullets"" after a chase. A number of officers were punished for their actions during the incident:

Officer Michael Brelo, who fired 49 rounds, is awaiting trial on voluntary manslaughter charges for the fatal shootings of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams. Five supervisors were charged with dereliction of duty for their roles in the chase that involved 62 police cruisers and 100 officers. More than 70 officers and supervisors were disciplined for their roles in the chase.
Justice officials will now hold meetings with police, public figures, and residents in order to put together a ""consent decree"" set of reform guidelines that will be overseen by a court-appointed monitor. Holder's department has enacted nine other such decrees during his tenure, which has been marked by aggressive action on racially tinged civil rights and policing issues.

Oral argument turned into an hourlong, hypertechnical inquiry into statutory construction and, eventually, the precarious balancing of two clauses against a semicolon.

Slate,L,Broken windows policing doesn’t work. It also may have killed Eric Garner.,"On July 17, 2014, an unarmed 43-year-old black man named Eric Garner was standing near the Staten Island Ferry dock when he was approached by several police officers. The cops suspected that Garner was selling untaxed cigarettes. A struggle ensued, and an officer named Daniel Pantaleo put Garner in a chokehold. Garner died, and the New York City medical examiner eventually ruled it a homicide. But on Wednesday afternoon, a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo.

Why was Garner approached at all? Because of the emphasis on “broken windows policing” under NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton. As Mayor Rudolph Giuliani’s police commissioner in the 1990s, Bratton presided over a surge in petty-crime law enforcement, on the theory that vigorously enforcing the small laws in some way dissuades or prevents people from breaking the big ones. There’s little evidence that theory is correct. Nevertheless, mayor-elect Bill de Blasio brought Bratton back as New York’s police commissioner last December. Bratton’s return meant the return of broken windows policing. “If you take care of the little things, then you can prevent a lot of the big things,” Bratton said in March, spouting the broken windows gospel. It’s that philosophy as much as anything else is to blame for Eric Garner’s death.


Bratton was a popular figure during the Giuliani era because crime rates fell on his watch. While observers were quick to credit his policies for that decline, there’s no reason to think the drop in violent crime had anything to do with broken windows or Bratton’s vaunted Compstat, a computer program that tracks crime statistics citywide.

The drop in New York’s violent crime rate, then and now, is consistent with a broader nationwide trend. Rates of violent crime have steadily declined nationwide over the past two decades, and nobody is really sure why. The best argument I’ve seen suggests that violent crime began to fall around the same time that the crack boom started to wane in the early 1990s. The rates have been dropping across the country since then.


We do know that the declines in violent crime in New York have been comparable to declines in cities that didn’t use Compstat or broken windows. As criminologist Richard Rosenfeld put it in a 2002 paper, “homicide rates also have decreased sharply in cities that did not noticeably alter their policing policies, such as Los Angeles, or that instituted very different changes from those in New York, such as San Diego.” The takeaway: Crime just keeps going down everywhere. Nobody is sure why.


In New York, broken windows has replaced stop-and-frisk as the controversial police tactic du jour. During his 2012 campaign, de Blasio pledged to rein in the ineffective and racist stop-and-frisk policies of Michael Bloomberg, and he has followed through on that promise. Meanwhile, de Blasio’s Republican mayoral opponent, Joseph Lhota, made the supposed glories of stop-and-frisk the centerpiece of his own doomed campaign. Lhota blasted de Blasio’s “recklessly dangerous agenda on crime,” and predicted that abandoning stop-and-frisk would turn New York City into something like the hellscape depicted in The Warriors, with gangs and street punks running roughshod over police officers.


This hasn’t happened. In a recent press conference, de Blasio and Bratton announced that violent crime rates are poised for historic lows in 2014. The New York Times reports that robberies and grand larcenies have both declined since 2013. The city’s homicide count sits at 290 as of Dec. 1, which puts New York on pace to beat last year’s record low homicide count of 335. And all this in a year when the New York Police Department is poised to log fewer than 50,000 stop-and-frisk incidents—a figure nearly 10 times lower than it was at New York’s stopping-and-frisking peak. Take that, Joe Lhota!


But this shouldn’t be surprising. Under the Bloomberg administration, hundreds of thousands of people were detained by police each year via the department’s stop-and-frisk program. Close to 90 percent of those people were released without charges after the stopping officers found nothing illegal. Whatever effect stop-and-frisk may have had as a deterrent was likely offset by the fact that it taught innocent people to fear and avoid the police. Stopping people who are doing nothing wrong on the grounds that they look vaguely suspicious only serves to alienate cops from the communities they’re supposed to serve.


With the decline of stop-and-frisk and the return of broken windows, the NYPD has traded one dubious tactic for another. When Bratton was appointed in December 2013, de Blasio positioned him as the opposite of his predecessor as police commissioner, Ray Kelly, saying in a press conference that “public safety and respect for the public aren’t contradictory ideas.” Bratton, for his part, promised policies of “mutual respect and mutual trust,” and vowed that “I will get it right in this city once more”—implying, of course, that he had gotten it right the first time. Three months later, the New York Times reported that arrests of subway panhandlers had tripled since Bratton took over, and that there had been “a noticeable spike in arrests for low-level violations in public housing developments.”


This renewed emphasis on misdemeanor “quality of life” arrests has sparked renewed criticisms from community members who are tired of being hassled. These criticisms spiked after Garner’s death in July. Six members of New York’s congressional delegation sent Attorney General Eric Holder a letter noting that “Mr. Garner’s death has taken place in the context of a broken windows policing strategy that appears to target communities of color for the enforcement of minor violations and low-level offenses.”


Two weeks after Garner’s death, de Blasio held a press conference to address these criticisms and defend broken windows. “Breaking a law is breaking a law, and it has to be addressed,” said de Blasio.


That’s nonsense. The cornerstone of effective policing is discretion. If the cops enforced every single law on the books in every single precinct at all hours of the day, New York City would become a police state. Is that what de Blasio and Bratton want?


For mayors and police commissioners, being “tough on crime” means actively implementing some specific policy. But given that violent crime seems to be declining on its own regardless of what they do, there’s a case to be made that de Blasio and Bratton are only making things worse. Here’s a suggestion for a new policing policy for New York City: First, do no harm.

Slate,L,"Creationism poll: How many Americans believe the Bible is literal, inerrant, or symbolic.","In a dozen polls taken from 1982 to 2014, Gallup has asked Americans to choose among three views of evolution. One view is that humans “developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God guided this process.” Another view is that humans “developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process.” The third option is that “God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so.”

Slate,L,"While We're Young trailer: Noah Baumbach movie stars Ben Stiller, Adam Driver, and Ad-Rock (VIDEO).","While We’re Young, the next movie written and directed by Noah Baumbach, premiered at the Toronto Film Festival back in September to glowing reviews. (The Guardian called it “almost perfect,” for instance, and described it as the director’s “most mainstream movie to date,” a judgment echoed by Variety.) The movie reunites Baumbach with his Greenberg star Ben Stiller, this time pairing him with Naomi Watts, who plays Stiller’s wife, and juxtaposing that couple with a younger duo, played by Adam Driver of Girls fame and Amanda Seyfried of Mean Girls fame.

The trailer, with admirable ambition, introduces us to the movie with quotes from Ibsen’s The Master Builder—and then cleverly echoes one of those quotes in its choice of song, “Let ’Em In” by Sir Paul McCartney, which was a big hit for Wings. The music at the beginning, by the way, is Vivaldi’s “Mandolin Concerto in C Major,” from Le Nozze di Figaro, which has a very Wes Anderson feel.

Slate,L,"Top skyscrapers around the world that were stalled, stunted, stopped midconstruction, or never built. ","“Without big dreams, there would be no tall buildings,” researchers from the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat write in a new report. “Conceiving, financing, designing, and constructing a skyscraper is no simple feat, even under the best of conditions.”

Alas, every grand architectural dream does not come to fruition, and not all skyscrapers end up reaching their ultimate heights. The researchers say that some projects suffer from “torturously slow gestation periods; many more have failed to start or were interrupted and cancelled. Naturally, we began to wonder how many tall buildings were started and not finished, and which held the records for longest construction time.”

The illustrations pictured above represent the world’s 20 tallest buildings that started works on site but were never completed as planned, as of last month. “The reasons that these designs were never fully realized are varied—some fell victim to financial obstacles, others, political pressures and cultural shifts.”

In the study, the authors note, a building is considered to be “never completed” when “site works had begun, but were completely halted, and no reports indicate that construction will continue. The site may go on to accommodate a new building, different to the original design, that may or may not retain the original construction.”


The Metropolitan Life North Annex in New York, for example, was meant to be 100 stories tall. Construction was halted in 1933 at the 31st floor and remained there when the building was completed in 1950. In 2006, construction began on the Waterview Tower in Chicago—a structure that was meant to be 1,047 feet (319 meters) and 89 stories tall—only to be halted at the 26th floor two years later. The building was ultimately redesigned, ending up at 617 feet (188 meters) tall and rebaptized OneEleven.

The Centro Financiero Confinanzas (aka Torre David) in Caracas, Venezuela, began construction in 1990 but was abandoned midproject for financial reasons. It sheltered several hundred Venezuelan families until they were relocated last July. The Pentominium in Dubai, begun in 2008, would have been the second-tallest building in the world had it been successfully completed for its target date of 2014, but only reached 30 stories when it was put on hold in 2011.


There are 50 building projects around the world 492 feet (150 meters) or taller that are currently on hold, meaning that construction began and stopped but is planned to resume.

Slate,L,Dave Brandon: The resignation of Michigan’s villainous athletic director is why we like college sports.,"On Sept. 27, the Michigan football team was losing badly at home to Minnesota, a team the Wolverines typically destroy. The loss would drop Michigan to 2–3 on the season, a new low point for a program that’s found a number of creative ways to embarrass itself over the last few years. The student section, looking for a scapegoat, broke into chants. The first was “Fire Brady,” referring to the team’s beleaguered head coach, Brady Hoke. Their next demand was much more unusual: “Fire Brandon,” the students shouted, calling for the head of Michigan’s unusually high-profile, and unusually unpopular, athletic director Dave Brandon.

Today, the students more or less got what they were asking for: Brandon resigned, his departure covered on ESPN’s bottom-line ticker and in the New York Times.  How did a college athletics administrator end up making national news? As the chant indicates, he did it by going to war with his team’s fans—and, hearteningly, losing.


Brandon, a former Domino’s Pizza CEO, was never beloved by Michigan fans. He jacked up ticket prices and created a hyped-up, corporate culture—novelty, made-for-TV matchups and novelty, made-for-TV uniforms—around a program whose supporters take pride (maybe too much pride) in their respect for tradition.


    Advertisement




In the past two months, the athletic director transformed from a figure of local disrepute to something of a national villain. In the Minnesota game—the same one during which students chanted for Brandon’s ouster—the Michigan coaching staff badly mishandled a player who had clearly been concussed, sending quarterback Shane Morris back into the game despite his obvious head injury. As fans and the national media rained invective down on the Michigan program, Brandon told a reporter that he had “more important” jobs to do than speaking to the press about the Morris imbroglio. And this week, the fan site MGoBlog published a number of snotty emails Brandon sent in response to complaints from alumni and season-ticket holders. “I really don’t care about your opinions,” read one. Another: “I suggest you find a new team to support. We will be fine without you.”


Meanwhile, Hoke, the head coach whom Brandon hired and has defended aggressively, has led the team to a 3–5 record and appears to be on his way out as well. Disenchanted students have taken their anger outside the stadium, marching on the university president’s house calling for Brandon’s dismissal. (That a Michigan football coach could lose to Michigan State by 24 points and not be the biggest problem on fans’ mind says a lot about Brandon’s popularity.)


Amid the deluge of bad press, Brandon remained, as they say, defiant, reportedly attributing the movement against him to electoral politics. (The University of Michigan is supervised by regents who declare party affiliations and are chosen via statewide vote.) It was the kind of spin he’d gotten away with many times before—as others have observed, Brandon’s usual response to backlash against his decisions is to blame someone else for them in a mealy-mouthed press release. He also had the public support of Stephen Ross, a real-estate billionaire and perhaps the most important man in Michigan’s vast network of alumni donors.


As the weeks went on and Brandon remained in his job, Michigan fans like me started to get a sinking feeling. How many times have we seen fans “rebel” against their team’s incompetent management to no effect whatsoever? The Knicks’ James Dolan, the Florida Marlins’ Jeffrey Loria, the Washington NFL franchise’s Dan Snyder—I could go on. Sports fans don’t have a lot of power—sure, they can stop going to games, but stubborn owners can ride out declines in revenue, especially given how much of their money comes from national TV deals shared with other teams. (Not to mention how many of them inherited their teams as part of larger family fortunes that can help cover losses.) A perennial state of justified but futile outrage is the norm for many of us.


But, as you may already have observed, college teams don’t have owners. Even someone as rich as Stephen Ross doesn’t get to have the final say on Dave Brandon’s job (although, perhaps realizing which way the wind was blowing, Ross said this week that he would not object if Brandon were replaced). That authority belongs to the school’s president, who must make decisions not on the principle of “I own the team so I can do whatever I want,” but by weighing the input of interested ticketholders, students, alumni, former players, and donors. Or, described collectively, fans.

Michigan’s president, Mark Schlissel, has been on something of a listening tour in the past few weeks, appearing at various public and private meetings within the university community and making carefully worded statements empathizing with fan frustration. Schlissel acknowledged the crisis, took public control of it, and nudged along the consensus that it was time for Brandon’s departure. It got to the point this week that the embattled A.D. had no choice but to come to that realization himself. It was a story of leaders channeling and managing popular opinion that could have come out of a civics textbook, right down to the compromise at the end. (Brandon gets to say he left on his own terms, and will receive the full $3 million he had left on his contract).


That college sports have a democratic element isn’t an unqualified advantage—for an example of what can go wrong in a consensus-based system, see 90 percent of American political news on any given day. But the fact that the community around college teams is an actual grassroots community does account for much of those teams’ appeal. (It’s worth noting that one of the most beloved and successful NFL franchises—the Green Bay Packers—is literally community-owned.) Over the last few months in Ann Arbor, the fans spoke and a team listened. When’s the last time you could say that?

Slate,L,Patrick Morarescu photographs performance artists.,"As an active member of the performance art community, Berlin-based Patrick Morarescu has met amazing artists from all over the world. But it wasn’t until 2010, while attending the Universe Performance Festival in Estonia, that it occurred to him to consider taking photos of these people he knew and admired. 

Rather than photograph the performances, Morarescu focuses his lens on the artists right after they finish their shows, while they “still have the energy of creativity.” 


“That feeling is what I want to capture in the portraits. It feels like you can still catch some traces of what happened in the performance some minutes before,” he said via email.

Performance art is a largely interdisciplinary genre, one that’s inclusive of many different techniques and approaches. Morarescu’s photos reflect the extreme diversity of places, costumes, and concepts that fall under its umbrella.


Morarescu has photographed more than 180 performers at art venues and festivals in dozens of countries. Usually organized by the artists, the festivals, he said, are “intense social exchanges” full of eating, drinking, and collaborating. “Sometimes it feels like a summer camp or a family reunion—in a positive way.”

            }
        });
         

He hopes his photos give a sense of each performer’s personality, but Morarescu also hopes they inspire more questions than they answer. “I want to awaken curiosity, open minds, and let viewers imagine what was happening before the photos.” 


And while he aims to evoke something of the performance in his photos, he wants viewers to see them as making unique artistic statements of their own. “Performance art is a marginal form, one that normally happens in front of small audiences in alternative venues far from the mainstream. What makes it special is its temporal condition, the fact that this art form is destructed at the same moment that is created,” he said. “The results are ephemeral and any effort to document or register them become new products that are something different.”

Then, in the early aughts, the network was sold to NBC and underwent a makeover, first with the help of respectable reality shows like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Project Runway and then with the Real Housewives, which transformed Bravo into the power-brand it is today: a home for delectable lowbrow entertainments that cater to people who are comfortable with the highbrow but get a kick out of a Lisa Vanderpump anyway. Under the guidance of its former head of development and network figurehead, Andy Cohen, Bravo has cultivated a self-aware audience of girls and gays with satisfying, winking, bitchy programming and a self-perpetuating universe of “bravolebrities,” who work Bravo’s cross-pollinating series of spin-offs, reunion specials, and talk shows like the Stations of the Cross.*

“Some pictures are agonizingly painful to look at, but I was conscious to make them in a way that people could imagine themselves in the scene. That was the challenge to ask people to step into the photograph, could they live in these circumstances? My question is could you live in these circumstances, and if you couldn’t, why wouldn’t you want to help?”

Sometimes a child is starved to appear sympathetic in the hope of generating more income while begging.

After spending two years making the photographs, Byer spent another two years editing the images and strategizing how to get the message out since she feels “a huge responsibility to my subjects. It’s not just enough to make a photograph—you have to get that photograph into a place where it can help.”


One of the hardest parts of editing was the understanding that a lot of people’s stories wouldn’t be heard. Byer hopes to get a website up that includes all of the outtakes from the book to continue the conversation.


“Painful,” she said about not being able to include everyone in the book. “Extremely painful. There are still photographs that tug at my heart I would love to put in the book … there’s only so much you can publish, there are several instances where I would lose sleep over those that didn’t make it into the book.”

Slate,L,Edie Bresler: We Sold a Winner looks at the stores that sold winning lottery tickets around the country (PHOTOS).,"Shortly after the economic crisis in 2008, Edie Bresler began noticing lottery tickets littering her neighborhood just outside Boston. She followed them back to the source and found that most of them had been sold at local mom-and-pop shops.

“It was like discovering an underground cult,” Bresler said. “The more time I spent in small stores talking to the people who were buying the tickets, the more I started realizing I knew nothing about it.”


She decided to photograph the culture behind the lottery and realized her initial discovery of small businesses was one of the more intriguing components. For her series, “We Sold a Winner,” she focuses on the shop owners who sold the winning tickets.

Close to $70 billion is spent in the United States on the lottery annually, or, as John Oliver put it recently, more than the total spent on music, movies, and porn combined. Aside from the winners, Breser noted, the owners of these mom-and-pop shops are some of the few people who actually benefit from winning tickets, although the commission they receive for selling a winning ticket varies drastically from state to state.


“Every state is different, some have a really small commission and others it is incredibly generous. In Michigan it’s $5,000 and in Illinois right next door it’s $500,000 so it’s crazy.” 



  Third and Fourth Generation Braddock Residents, Al and Albert. Father and son work together at this Pennsylvania shop that opens daily at 4 a.m. to serve workers in nearby steel mills. They sold three winning jackpot tickets in consecutive months. Their total bonus commission was $10,500. Edie Bresler

            }
        });
         

So far, out of the 44 states that have a lottery, Bresler has been to around 20. She gets notifications and, depending on her schedule, travels to the stores that award prizes of at least $1 million. She then hangs around for up to a week meeting the owners and the people who play the lottery, interviewing them and taking their pictures.


She uses primarily a digital camera but also brings along her 4X5. She said working with the more cumbersome camera is often a great icebreaker since people become curious about the equipment.


“It’s incredibly valuable because I’m out there all day and I let them look and see how it works so by the time the light is right, they’re all rooting for me and they’re also all ignoring me,” she said. “I think it is a way for them to feel I am really serious about what I’m doing, I’m there to engage with them and talk with them and they enjoy it … they appreciate that it is an art form.”


“I discovered another robust economy,” she said about the ticket sellers. “One owner put it to me this way: ‘A store without the lottery is like a bar without alcohol.’ ”

Answer by Joshua Engel:

English speakers have a surreal fascination with obscure words.


I don't know if this is unique to English speakers. Maybe everybody does it. But there are a lot of words that are “in” the English language, primarily in the sense of being in dictionaries of the English language. Those dictionaries are full of Nonce words, created for a one-off purpose and never used again. But dictionary-makers love those words, and as long as they have a citation, they'll put it in the dictionary.


The word nonce was coined by the creator of the Oxford English Dictionary, which is crammed full of nonce words. There are whole dictionaries filled with nothing but nonce words, such as Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure, and Preposterous Words. Rich Hall coined the word sniglet for making up a word just because you want it to exist and published several books of it. Douglas Adams published a similar book,The Meaning of Liff.


I don't know why such things exist, but English speakers appear to love this game. They love to make up words, and the dictionary-makers are obsessed with collecting them. They'll similarly suck up any word ever used in any dialect of English. The makers of the Scrabble dictionary are the worst, randomly accumulating words from foreign languages when they're likely to prove useful in the game but are never otherwise used.


In my opinion, it's a bit misleading to even call such things “English words.” The actual English language, in use, is not significantly larger than other major languages. An abridged dictionary is going to cover the vast majority of words that see real use, and using words from outside that set often seems affected rather than precise. It has left English with a lovely collection of subtle differences between words with nearly the same surface meaning, and I think that has had a beneficial effect on English prose, but it's practically designed to exclude foreigners.

            Matt Groening's ""cromulent"" (meaning basically, ""for real, not just made-up"") is my favorite nonce word.  Because think about it - is ""cromulent"" a cromulent word, or not?  Boom - your head just exploded.  More...

Which may actually be the answer. There's a one-upmanship (in any language) to marking in-groups and out-groups with vocabulary. Knowledge of obscure words is seen in some circles as a mark of intelligence. That's not completely absurd, since vocabulary does correlate with reading, and knowledge of obscure topics will bring topic-related jargon. But a lot of the more absurd words seem to exist solely for the purpose of showing off that you know the words.


In my opinion, if you Google a word and the first few links are dictionary entries, then the word isn't really a functional part of the English language anymore, if it ever were. It’s best ignored.

When the weather is clear and all systems are go, as many as 3,100 flights can take off and land each day at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, the busiest airport in the world. In recent years, the airport has expanded its flight capacity slightly, but not by increasing the number of runways. Watch the planes take off, and you might see a more subtle innovation.


Because air traffic controllers are now monitoring departing aircraft with GPS-based systems rather than radar, the planes follow much more precise and predictable paths—some straight ahead, others instead banking several degrees to the left or right. This more accurate tracking lets controllers release more planes for takeoff into the same airspace while maintaining the required separation distance of 3 horizontal miles and 1,000 vertical feet. By halving the time to clear the next flight for departure on some runways from two minutes to one, Atlanta controllers can now put as many as 12 more planes per hour into the heavens.

In many ways, flying has become an unpleasant, increasingly expensive, and frequently contentious effort. America’s airports feel like glorified bus stations in comparison to the sleek terminals of Asia and the Middle East. The consumer interface of air travel—bag charges, humiliating security procedures, $8 stale sandwiches, evaporating leg room—can seem as frenzied and dreadful as a Hieronymus Bosch painting.


But the carefully choreographed diversions on Atlanta’s runways, which shave just seconds off flights, are, in their own subtle way, as graceful as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and as awe-inspiring as the Colossus of Rhodes. They’re one of the many remarkable aspects of an air-control regime that most people never notice—a system that is one of the marvels of the modern world.


This series will explore seven of these new wonders: bewildering achievements, incredibly useful tools and services that we take for granted. None of them is monumental in scale, like the seven wonders of classical antiquity chronicled by Antipater of Sidon more than 2,000 years ago. The Great Pyramids of Giza and the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were feats of engineering, triumphs of man over nature and gravity, and above all accomplishments of ego and raw power. And the modern, man-made wonders we marvel at—the Brooklyn Bridge, the Hoover Dam, the Panama Canal—are echoes of the ancient ones: breathtaking physical manifestations of human ingenuity. Today’s wonders, in contrast, aren’t so in your face. Instead, they’re powered and made possible by systems, infrastructure, and technologies that are often invisible. The Lighthouse of Alexandria was a triumph of front-end, or consumer-facing, engineering, to use a Web developer’s terminology. But today’s innovations, insights, and wonders can just as frequently be found in the back end, where we rarely notice them.

            }
        });
         

Like the ancient wonders, this list is somewhat arbitrary. But there is a method to it. Sure, the world is filled with new, man-made wonders of an astounding scale, like the CCTV headquarters in Beijing and the Three Gorges Dam. But monumental buildings and dams have been done before, even millennia ago. Today, the point of buildings and infrastructure shouldn’t be to impress but to connect. In the 21st century, our ability to thrive rests in large measure on the quality and power of the networks that transport data, information, and life-giving substances like water. Part of this series’s goal is to highlight systems that are overlooked or maligned yet remain both extraordinarily functional and vital to the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people.


That’s certainly the case with the U.S. aviation control system. With land and infrastructure dollars hard to come by, subtle upgrades to the operating system are effectively increasing the capacity of our airports and skies, making it all run more smoothly and safely.


In the U.S., air travel is a form of mass transit, so these efficiency improvements matter a great deal. In 2013, there were 21.58 million commercial flights, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. And serious glitches, on the ground and in the skies, have become more rare. Between 2007 and 2013, the likelihood of a piece of luggage being mislaid fell by more than half—from a rate of 7.03 per 1,000 passengers to 3.22 per 1,000, as the Wall Street Journal reported. (That, in turn, is less than half the global rate of 6.96 per 1,000.)

$('.tablet-ad').html(html).css('clear', 'both').find('br').first().remove();
console.log($('.tablet-ad').html());
});



The global system, of course, is far from foolproof, as the lost Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and its cousin shot down over the Ukraine made clear earlier this year. But in the U.S., the world’s busiest airspace, safety has improved dramatically. According to National Transportation Safety Board data, between 1994 and 2006 there were only two years in which no fatalities were recorded on scheduled commercial domestic flights. But in six of the last seven years, and in each of the past four, there have been none. Between 2010 and 2013, there were 2.94 billion passenger emplanements on scheduled commercial flights—about 735 million annually. All those people reached their destinations alive, with just 12 injuries. (The 2009 Colgan Air crash outside Buffalo, New York, which killed 50 people, was the last major commercial disaster within our borders. There have been several fatal crashes involving cargo or chartered planes.*)


The air traffic control system—the ground-based radar installations, the onboard navigation devices, the 264 FAA towers, and the software and networks that connect them and manage the movement of planes—actually works remarkably well, even if widespread delays and cancellations sometimes lead us to curse the entire mode of transportation instead of marveling, as we once did, at the triumph of human flight. Traveling the skies may no longer feel like a miracle, but the systems that make it possible and increasingly more efficient deserve our adulation. Slowly, imperceptibly, and often invisibly, the FAA is rolling out what it calls the NextGen project, an alphabet soup of acronyms that describe a set of initiatives, procedures, and protocols that are improving the way we fly. “It’s not going to be the sort of thing where we flip a switch,” FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto says. “But we are going to phase out the old system.”

        requirejs([""jquery""], function($) {
            if ($(window).width() < 640) {
                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

Though sturdy, the legacy system—a network of ground-based radar stations that feed information to controllers, who then communicate with pilots over radio—is like an analog system in an increasingly digital world. Ground-based radar signals degrade over distance and can’t penetrate mountains. The stations can’t be placed on water. And the radar updates only once every 4.7 seconds. All of which requires planes to stay farther apart from one another in the air—clogging up vital air channels—and poses significant challenges in navigating over water, around weather, and in mountainous areas.


Increasingly, though, that’s changing. As part of NextGen, a satellite-based system called Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B, will use GPS to locate planes and connect them to air traffic control. By Jan. 1, 2020, all aircraft flying in controlled airspace will be required to have ADS-B equipment. ADS-B is now enabling planes to fly around weather over open water in the Gulf of Mexico—saving time and fuel and sometimes completely sparing passengers from turbulence. And instead of exchanging vital information orally—which ties up radio frequencies and can result in miscommunications—pilots and controllers will rely on powerful data transmission and processing systems. In 2013, introductory programs began in Memphis, Tennessee, and Newark, New Jersey, in which routine communications—clearance to take off, a change in route to avoid a thunderstorm—were effectively delivered to LCD screens via text updates.

There are also smaller, localized fixes. In airports like the Yampa Valley Regional Airport, which services ski areas like Steamboat Springs, Colorado, delays and cancellations play havoc with schedules during the peak season, in large measure because radar isn’t very good at tracking planes as they negotiate mountainous areas. As part of a small-scale experiment, the FAA deployed a bunch of sensors in the area to form a network, called wide area multilateration, that can keep much better tabs on planes. The upshot: Yampa Valley can handle 15 to 20 arrivals safely each hour in conditions that would have previously required planes to be diverted to other airports.


Throughout the air traffic control system, new protocols—based in part on new technology and on research and analysis—effectively expand flight capacity by enabling planes to flow in and out of airports and airspaces more quickly and with fewer hitches. At Boston Logan and other airports, GPS-based systems that allow for more precise tracing of planes mean they can now land when visibility is as low as 1,800 feet—compared with the prior standard of 2,400 feet.


At John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, where the traffic on the runways has often rivaled that on the New Jersey Turnpike, controllers are now using a virtual queuing system. By forecasting traffic through historical data, they assign 15-minute slots to flights up to two hours in advance. Rather than leave the gate and sit on the runway, planes wait with their engines off until their appointed times. That saves fuel (since they can run systems on electric power at the gate) and reduces congestion in the taxi areas.

        requirejs([""jquery""], function($) {
            if ($(window).width() < 640) {
                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

Meanwhile, changes in technology and the addition of smaller jets to America’s aviation fleet have led controllers to re-examine the effects of wake turbulence—the vortexes that planes leave in their wake when they take off. In certain instances, as when smaller jets are in a queue behind aircraft of the same size, the FAA has concluded that it’s safe to let planes begin taking off right after the ones in front of them have left the ground, instead of waiting the traditional three minutes. When it was first tested in Memphis, wake recategorization effectively boosted capacity of runways by up to 20 percent. After controllers in Atlanta started using recategorization in June, it evoked a sense of wonder in the industry. “That is saving a minute or a minute and a half right there,” said Mark Hopkins, Delta’s director of air traffic management. “This is eye-opening.”


Taken individually—a minute saved here, a few hundred of feet of visibility added there, several gallons of fuel conserved somewhere else—these improvements may not seem to add up to much. But just as a small delay in a complex system can lead to further delays, small innovations can have powerful knock-on effects. These incremental fixes, all rolled out with little notice, highlight how our more reliable and efficient aviation system has become a modern marvel. And impressively, the FAA is slowly pushing through its immense upgrades while operating at full-tilt in a highly safe and surprisingly effective manner. That’s like replacing the George Washington Bridge in its entirety without lane closures or new traffic problems.


In an age in which constricted financial resources and geographic footprints prevent us from expanding the physical footprint of airports, the highly resilient and evolving air traffic control system is doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes. We should look up in awe.

The seven wonders of classical antiquity were architectural marvels, triumphs of human ego and raw power. The great achievements of today, however, are made possible by systems, infrastructure, and technologies that are invisible. This series, which began with the U.S. aviation control system, explores the wonders of our modern world. Here is the second wonder:

The Dynamic Map






In the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in the autumn of 2012, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had no idea which gas stations were open or closed in the greater New York area. With widespread flooding and electricity outages, and with downed trees blocking roads, there was no way—short of the slow task of dialing up each station—to swiftly determine which ones had gas or even power. So FEMA contacted Waze, a free navigation app that allows users to anonymously post data about traffic incidents and edit maps. Waze sent a push notice to drivers, asking them to share the status of stations in their neighborhoods. The app then updated its maps to show pins on stations that were up and running. After quickly cataloging the information, Waze zapped it to FEMA in an Excel file, which helped the agency effectively dispatch tanker trucks to replenish supplies.

            if ($(window).width() < 640) {
                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

Waze has grown rapidly since its founding in 2008 by Amir Shinar and Ehud Shabtai, Israeli computer experts who were dissatisfied with the global positioning systems in their cars. When Los Angeles shut down the I-405 in the July 2012 “Carmageddon,” Waze users provided traffic information more effectively than traffic helicopters could. In fall 2012, when Tim Cook publicly apologized for the debacle of Apple Maps, he recommended Waze as an alternative. The service now claims more than 50 million users in 45 languages, in 200 countries. Last year, Google acquired Waze for a price reported at about $1 billion. While big tech companies often buy startups only to absorb their innovations and shutter them, Google has made Waze part of the family. The app has incorporated Google Street View and hired more people, while Google Maps has added Waze data on traffic and street closures.


It might be easier to appreciate today’s browser- and app-based dynamic maps and the systems and devices that power them—Waze and Google Maps, but also Scout, Polaris, TomTom, Garmin, and Magellan—as wonders of the modern world if, like me, you’re old enough to remember when planning a cross-country driving trip meant visiting a AAA office to get a Trip-Tik (a set of highlighted maps). Even with paper maps, in some ways drivers were flying blind. Beyond periodic traffic updates on the radio, there was virtually no real-time information available about road closures, accidents, construction—the phenomena that can turn an easy 15-minute trip into a grinding two-hour ordeal. As recently as a decade ago, a driver departing Montclair, New Jersey, would have no idea whether it made more sense to take the Garden State Parkway or the New Jersey Turnpike.

                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

But in recent years, individuals have been able to tap into the technology that was once the exclusive preserve of the military. Like so many other staples of consumer life—from CorningWare to the Internet—GPS has its origins in Cold War–era military research. After the shock of Sputnik, the Pentagon began working on ways to use orbiting satellites to help fix the positions of submarines and other naval vessels. A network of several satellites in the 1960s, known as Transit, was augmented by the NAVSTAR system, the construction of which began in the 1970s.


Today’s GPS apps and devices reach to the heavens to help us navigate our little corners of the Earth. We can know that traffic is seriously backed up on the southbound lanes of I-95 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, because a car is broken down on the side of the road, that a tow truck has just arrived, and that it makes sense to jump onto Route 1 and then re-enter I-95 a few miles later in Fairfield. These mostly free services are some of the most valuable—but difficult to value—components of the so-called “consumer surplus” that our modern information economy provides.


With its singular combination of technology, human intelligence, and curation, Waze illustrates the awe-inspiring potential of the dynamic map better than any of its competitors. And the attributes that make the app so popular—think Wikipedia or Pinterest, but for traffic and maps—are highly visible. But just like America’s increasingly sophisticated air traffic control system, which I explored in the first part of this series, Waze is a back-end marvel. Unlike the Great Pyramid of Giza or the other seven wonders of antiquity, its most amazing innovations are invisible.


Most GPS-based navigation and traffic apps rely on road cameras and sensors on highly trafficked roads and are updated every five minutes or so. I find it’s not uncommon for me to check out traffic on MapQuest or Google Maps before leaving the house only to find Connecticut’s Merritt Parkway is surprisingly backed up a few minutes later. Waze aims to provide more useful, actionable information by instantly updating data and context—provided by both machines and humans—via a cute, friendly interface. (Of course, as is the case with many free apps and publications, the user experience is occasionally disrupted by pop-up ads.)


Waze’s back end, obviously, includes the network of Google servers, wireless stations, satellites, and software code that powers it. But that’s just the beginning. Massive, open public editing of a site can be a road to misinformation and mischief—just read any Internet comments section or contentious Wikipedia page. Waze overlays its data with a constant stream of user-submitted comments, then runs them through systems it has built to channel and reward human behavior. Then it figures out how to make this system do useful work in the world. All of this happens behind the scenes.

if (!mobileMode()){$('.renderHtml:eq(2)').css('margin-left','87px');}



Part of Waze’s back end is passive. When a Waze user turns on a phone and opens the app, Waze pings the phone’s GPS chip every second and recalculates traffic every three minutes. The simple act of driving with the app open turns users into traffic reporters—confirming they are on the road and giving an indication of speed. Scale makes this passive crowdsourcing useful. On an average day in Rio de Janeiro, 110,000 active Waze drivers cover 1.2 million kilometers. The data isn’t just broadcast, however. Waze feeds it into algorithms that enable it to conduct predictive modeling based on past experience. So when somebody maps a prospective route through Rio, Waze can produce suggestions based on reported traffic conditions and on how long it typically takes drivers to negotiate the routes at that time of day. (In an update earlier this year, Google Maps integrated the ability to change routes on the fly in reaction to traffic snarls.)


Part of the appeal of Waze is that users can report incidents—traffic, congestion, a mattress in the road—that instantly generate icons on its maps. On a typical day in Rio, users actively report about 58,000 incidents. But in the back end, not all incident reports are treated equally. Waze has built a system that evaluates users’ capacity, experience, and accuracy, weighing the information they provide accordingly. Like many social apps, Waze allows users the opportunity to give a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” to posts. Reports by users who frequently file incidents that are routinely confirmed by others will be weighted higher, while Waze gives less trust to people who consistently file false alarms.


Mapping the world and charting its traffic problems are extraordinarily labor-intensive undertakings. That’s where Waze’s human back end comes into play. The company has about 160 employees, divided between Tel Aviv, Israel; New York; and Mountain View, California. But the map—a breathing organism that constantly evolves to ensure the accuracy of street names, housing numbers, and construction sites—is maintained by a community of 200,000 volunteer map editors. Editors—anybody can sign up—start by making notations about their immediate area. “We don’t manage them, we don’t pay them, we don’t tell them what to do,” says Julie Mossler, a Waze spokeswoman. But the company doesn’t have an entirely hands-off attitude. People who have made 1 million edits or more are considered “champs,” and they have a direct line to the company. And Waze now provides support to a group of editors based in Italy who are starting a project to map Africa more accurately.


While Waze could function perfectly well without much human intervention from its headquarters, its competitive advantage and utility arise in part from the relationships its staff cultivates and their ability to inject human intelligence into the system—whether it’s reaching out to Los Angeles authorities during Carmageddon or working with FEMA to generate lists of open gas stations. In early October, when a Waze staffer learned that President Obama was visiting San Francisco, the app sent a push notice to advise users in the area to get out on the roads a little earlier. And the company just set up a partnership—Connected Citizen—in which it will provide traffic data to cities like Tel Aviv; Barcelona, Spain; and San Jose, Costa Rica in exchange for more immediate access to information on issues like road closures or construction. All of which proves that even in a highly wired and automated world, personal and institutional relationships can be a vital part of infrastructure.

            if ($(window).width() < 640) {
                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

Government is supposed to step in during a market failure. But Waze shows how the market can correct for government failure. The app is extremely popular in Costa Rica. Why? In a nation where authorities haven’t bothered to name many roads and streets and paper maps are unreliable, Waze volunteers have effectively functioned as a sort of public agency. In places where the grid has yet to be captured, Waze isn’t an adjunct to maps—it is the map. “Waze has become such a part of the culture that businesses will even list their addresses in advertisements as locations that can be searched for on Waze,” the Washington Post reported recently.


Waze likely won’t be around forever, but its many features, some subtle and some outright mind-bending, suggest that the maps we rely on every day are only going to get more sophisticated, data-rich, and, yes, wondrous. It’s easy to imagine the maps of the future being studded and layered with information on Wi-Fi hot spots, crime data, public transit schedules, and weather. Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map, which allowed him to see who was scurrying around Hogwarts late at night, will have nothing on the amazing, thoroughly unmagical cartographic apps in our pockets.


Already, as I pull out of my driveway, I can know that traffic is dragging at an 8-mile clip on the Post Road in downtown Westport, Connecticut, which means I should use a back roads cut-through. I can expect that repair teams have arrived for the bridge project on I-95 north, which is keeping traffic running at a pokey 23 miles per hour. And I can prepare to accelerate to above 40 miles per hour right after the underpass—that last tip courtesy of a Waze user whose avatar includes sunglasses and a little sword.


In another era, the sunglasses-and-swords guy might have been adding blocks to the Great Pyramid. These days, he’s contributing to our modern maps’ achievement of near omniscience in a chaotic, ever-changing system.

The seven wonders of classical antiquity were architectural marvels, triumphs of human ego and raw power. The great achievements of today, however, are made possible by systems, infrastructure, and technologies that are invisible. This series, which continued last week with GPS-powered dynamic maps, explores the wonders of our modern world. Here is the third wonder:

The Undersea Information Highway






Ever think twice about our superfast data connections? Email accounts. Skype chats. Stock quotes. The latest Taylor Swift video on YouTube. All would have been either impossible or extremely expensive 25 years ago. All are free and available at any time—on a handheld device, on our desktops. Our words, ideas, emotions, and emoticons travel at the speed of light, from pretty much any point on the surface of the Earth to any other.


We may live in a mobile and wireless world, but wires still drive the global communications revolution. Your phone call, text, email, or emoji-laden tweet may travel wirelessly from your iPhone to the nearest cellular tower, but from there on out it is largely confined to cables, wires, and cords—express lanes coursing above ground, underground, and under the sea—especially if your message is going abroad. “More than 99 percent of signals of any sort that go between continents flow over undersea fiber-optic cables,” says Tim Stronge, research analyst at TeleGeography, a research and consulting firm. Were submarine cables not as pervasive, cheap, and functional as they are, most of us would still be living on data islands. To the extent that the world is now flat, it is largely due to the expansive network of undersea cables. They enable a dot-com entrepreneur in Perth, Australia, to collaborate with a programmer in Bangalore, India, serve a customer in Germany, and communicate with a supplier in China.

These contemporary Appian Ways are the vital back end of the Internet—and one of the wonders of the modern world. Lying under the murky depths of the Southern Atlantic, the placid, teal waters of the Caribbean, and the frigid, stormy Bering Sea, underwater cables withstand the ravages of sharks and resist immense pressure and the corroding influence of salt. Amid the sprawling network (laid out in this gorgeous map produced by TeleGeography), one stands out for its length. Starting in Australia and terminating in Germany, SEA-ME-WE 3 (for SouthEast Asia Middle East Western Europe) is a modern-day Orient Express. A marvel of modern synergy, it was built (and is still owned) by a consortium of 92 telecommunications firms. Running 39,000 kilometers—about 24,000 miles—and touching 39 landing points in 33 countries on four continents, SEA-ME-WE 3 is the closest thing we have to a transoceanic information superhighway.


Today’s submarine cables are the latest flowering of an infrastructure class that was pioneered in the 19th century, given impetus by a construction boom in the late 20th century, and which has been made immensely more powerful (and cheaper) by 21st-century technology developments. Indeed, thanks to the application of new hardware and processes, a cable like SEA-ME-WE 3 can now carry 40 times more data than it could when it was first laid—a feat that physical conduits for physical goods, like roads and railways, could never mimic.

The first great submarine communication cable, of course, was the telegraph line connecting England and the United States. In A Thread Across the Ocean: The Heroic Story of the Transatlantic Cable, John Steele Gordon describes how Cyrus Field rounded up cash and got the U.S. and U.K. governments to fund his scheme. (The Niagara, the largest ship in the U.S. Navy, laid out the cable.) The first message sent from Queen Victoria to President James Buchanan, in August 1858, inspired fireworks in New York City that set City Hall on fire. In a remark Tom Friedman might have appreciated, Cyrus Field’s brother, Henry, wrote that it “joins the sundered hemispheres. It unites distant nations, making them feel that they are members of one great family.” Three weeks later, the cable went dead. Tiffany & Co. bought parts of the unused cable and cut them into 4-inch pieces to sell. (One was auctioned on eBay last year.) Field finally succeeded in laying a lasting cable in 1866. The cost for capacity: $10 a word. By 1900, there were 15 competing threads across the ocean.


Laid in 1956, TAT-1, the first transatlantic telephone cable, used the same type of copper wire employed in terrestrial phone lines. But the midcentury threads were exceedingly narrow pipe. TAT-1 could accommodate just 48 64 kbps (kilobits per second) circuits—just four dozen phone conversations at once. It’s not surprising, then, that in the 1960s international phone calls cost about $3 per minute. The development of fiber-optic cable by Corning in the 1960s and 1970s (chronicled in a chapter in a book I wrote)—using glass as a transport medium rather than a metal—brought a quantum leap in the speed and capacity for communication wires. Fiber-optic cable—insanely thin glass threads, really—can handle so many more conversations and bits than wireless spectra can. The first fiber-optic cable laid across the Atlantic, the TAT-8, was completed in 1988 and could carry 7,560 simultaneous voice conversations.





The 1990s brought a boom in both the pace of construction and the power and capacity of cables. The AC-1 trans-Atlantic cable, an 8,700-mile round-trip line first used in 1998, could handle the equivalent of 483,840 simultaneous voice conversations, according to Stronge. Firms like Global Crossing, whose market capitalization peaked at $45 billion in the spring of 2000, laid pipe anywhere and everywhere—and then went bust.











SEA-ME-WE 3 began amid the tech bubble. Australia and the rest of Oceania are separated from other huge commercial and population centers by vast expanses of water. Australia’s line to the other six continents was an analog line, the AIS (Australia-Indonesia-Singapore) cable. Construction of SEA-ME-WE 3, which started in January 1997 and was completed in 2000, proceeded in a way that would have been recognizable to 19th-century telegraph cable experts. As Stronge notes, when cable is loaded onto a vessel, “They have this giant drum in the ship and hire people to walk the cable around in a concentric circle.”


The ships proceeded methodically, paying out cable that is the width of a garden hose—an outer diameter of 21 millimeters, to be precise—and encased in a plastic coating. From Perth, SEA-ME-WE 3 goes north. At Malaysia, a branch reaches out to East Asia, surfacing at Mersing, Indonesia; Danang Vietnam; and Shanghai. Across the northern stretches of the Indian Ocean it goes, hitting Sri Lanka, Mumbai, and Karachi, further west to Muscat and Djibouti City, before crooking up through the Red Sea and Suez Canal. From Alexandria, Egypt, it hits Mediterranean ports of call before wheeling around Iberia and France, finally ending in the chilly waters of the North Sea near Norden, Germany.


For most of its sojourn, SEA-ME-WE 3 lies on the bottom of the murky depths. In deep water—more than 3,000 meters—the cables are laid on the seabed. In shallower waters, where ships might snag them, a plow buries them. SEA-ME-WE 3 has two fiber pairs, and such cables often have copper running through them—which supplies the electricity that powers repeaters, small devices positioned every 50 kilometers that boost the signal. At certain points, the cable is up-armored—coated in metal tape, sheathing, or screens—to protect against potential dangers. (The extra screen helps shield electromagnetic waves that attract sharks.) While failures are often ascribed to monsters of the deep gnawing through them, Stronge says such instances are rare. “There was one famous incident in the 1980s when a cable failed, and they think it was because a shark had bitten through to where the electricity was flowing.” When links break or are severed, as has happened on SEA-ME-WE 3 on about a half-dozen occasions, ships are sent out to repair the damage. (Fishing nets and ship anchors account for most of these incidents.) The sea cables are connected to beach manholes at the shore, through which they connect to land cables and the broader terrestrial grids.

The global economy has benefited from the boom in cable construction. Immense excess capacity, combined with technological improvements, has led to falling prices. The stupidity of investors and the willingness of bondholders and stockholders to sacrifice their money so that others could have cheap communications infrastructure are dynamics we’ve seen in the telegraph and railroad industries. (I wrote a book about this, too.) “Prices for capacity are one one-thousandth what they were in the late 1990s,” Stronge says. Since 1997, the amount of “lit” capacity–i.e., the amount being used—in the Atlantic Ocean between the U.S. and Europe has risen from 33 gigabits per second to 27 terabits per second, an 818-fold increase. But, notes Stronge, the total capacity of all cables—including “dark fiber” that’s not in use—across the Atlantic is 173 terabits per second, which means just 16 percent is being used. On major submarine cable routes, bandwidth demand rose 4.5 times between 2009 to 2013. But even so, less than one-quarter of the potential capacity on these routes is being used. Every year, the price of connections grows cheaper. According to TeleGeography, median monthly lease prices on major submarine cable routes submarine cables fell between 10 and 26 percent in 2013.


That’s in part because the state-owned and private telecom companies that have built and run the global network continue to add to it, especially in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. (SEA-ME-WE 3 was followed by SEA-ME-WE 4, which provided redundancy along similar paths, from Singapore to France.) But it’s also because innovation on the back end has increased the carrying capacity of tubes that were laid down long ago. When SEA-ME-WE 3 was completed, it could carry up to 40 gigabits per second of data traffic. Today, SingTel, which runs the cable, says it has a capacity of 1 terabit per second—a 25-fold increase. That’s in large measure due to the introduction of wavelength division multiplexing. Essentially, a bunch of signals can now travel on the same pair of fiber cables because new, more powerful transceivers on the ends of cable lines can send and receive the signal on different frequencies of light. As SingTel notes, “The cable has been twice upgraded and it now consists of two fiber pairs, each carrying eight wavelengths.”

To the history-minded, the map of submarine cables is remarkably evocative. A host of them connects the Northeastern U.S. with England and France, mimicking the early patterns of North America settlement. Some follow the journeys of Vasco Da Gama and Magellan, bumping down from Portugal along the coast toward South Africa. There are tiny components like the Amerigo Vespucci, an 85-kilometer spur that connects Curacao, a former Dutch colony, to Bonaire, which is still part of the Netherlands. There are unlikely hubs, like Bude, at the tip of Cornwall in England, where seven cables arrive from across the seas. Like triremes, schooners, and clippers before them, these cables hug land and then seek direct, obstacle-free paths across the waters. But instead of delivering physical goods, they deliver digital goods and services.


Like all good networks, the mesh of submarine cables is being expanded to offer more capacity and more redundancy. The SEA-ME-WE 5, now under construction, parallels a good chunk of SEA-ME-WE 3 between Malaysia and France. And while it’s difficult to improve much on the speed of light, the network is getting marginally faster. It takes about 60 milliseconds to bounce a signal from New York to London. “But for some users of bandwidth, particularly banks that are doing trading or arbitrage, shaving off one millisecond can make huge profits,” Stronge says. That’s why Hibernia Networks is now working on Project Express, a cable that will carve a shorter path across the Atlantic—from Halifax in Nova Scotia to the west coast of England.  


SEA-ME-WE 3 and its siblings may not be any more effective than the telegraph in joining sundered hemispheres or making distant nations feel like one great family. But they make it possible for us to lead 21st-century lives, at faster and faster speeds. And they should inspire the same type of awe that a 19th-century telegraph cable did. “These are the days of miracle and wonder,” Paul Simon once sang. “This is the long-distance call.”

Slate,L,Barnes & Noble buys out Microsoft's Nook stake to prepare for e-reader spinoff.,"The decline of Barnes & Noble's beleaguered Nook has been slow and steady. The e-reader, first introduced in October 2009 as a response to Amazon's Kindle, stumbled from the get-go. In late June Barnes & Noble announced it would spin off the Nook unit completely. And as a step toward that, the company said Thursday that it has ended a partnership with Microsoft in the Nook business.

Microsoft invested $300 million in Nook in 2012 in exchange for a 17.6 percent stake. Even then, Barnes & Noble was already looking into spinning off the unit, but appeared ready to reconsider after the Microsoft cash infusion. Then, this March, Barnes & Noble and Microsoft decided to scale back their partnership by ending work on Nook apps for Windows computers, phones, and tablets. At the time, Barnes & Noble said in a statement that it looked forward to continuing the partnership with Microsoft and ""expanding the availability of Nook content.""

Barnes & Noble is purchasing Microsoft's stake for about $125 million in cash and stock. Michael Huseby, Barnes & Noble's chief executive, said in a statement that the split will help Barnes & Noble ""further rationalize the Nook business and provide a clearer path for the potential separation of our retail and Nook media businesses."" Microsoft said in its own statement that ""as the respective business strategies of each company evolved, we mutually agreed that it made sense to terminate the agreement."" The Nook spinoff, initially announced for March 2015, is now expected to be complete by the end of August.



The announcement about the Microsoft partnership was tucked into the second quarter earnings report that Barnes & Noble released Thursday. Over the past three months, the Nook's revenues fell 41.3 percent to $63.9 million. Barnes & Noble's overall revenues also declined 2.7 percent to $1.69 billion. The only bright spot for the bookstore in the latest quarter was its college arm, which posted a 1.9 percent increase in revenue to $751.3 million. Barnes & Noble will have to wait until its next earnings report to see whether the holiday season and a clever signed-books promotion on Black Friday can give a much-needed boost to its sales.



As for now, shares of the bookstore chain are down nearly 10 percent in midday trading, to $20.09. Despite that, Barnes & Noble has performed fairly well this year, with its stock up more than 30 percent since January.

The raucous events, which are hosted by New Orleans Ladies Arm Wrestling, combine the performative, athletic elements of a WWE match with the communal, boozy aspects of a trivia night. It’s one of more than 25 chapters across the world under the umbrella of the Collective of Lady Arm Wrestlers. 

“They're such colorful events. You never know what's going to happen,” Arnold said. “I got addicted. I ended up joining the collective and taking pictures of my friends.”

At NOLAW’s events, which are held a few times a year at bars, galleries, and other spaces across the city, eight arm wrestlers—each with their own costumed persona, theme song, and entourage—compete before hundreds of spectators. According to NOLAW, “rules are determined and managed by the referee, only to be manipulated and corrupted by celebrity judges, crowd hecklers, and dolla billz.”

The events aren’t just fun and games. They’re also fundraisers, with all proceeds benefiting local groups supporting women and children. (The groups, in return, create the winner’s trophy and submit a member to wrestle in the tournament.)

        });
         

Photographing arm wrestling, Arnold said, is like photographing a concert: It involves shooting fast-moving subjects in low light, as well as avoiding getting in the way of audience members. Still, she said, NOLAW’s events are “a photographer’s dream.” Hilarious wrestler alter egos—Babe Lincoln, Amelia Armheart, Ruth Hater Ginsburg—come with equally outrageous costumes and stunts as they prepare to compete. Half-time acts include drag queens and burlesque dancers. Crowds are loud and enthusiastic. 


“We want to create a fun, safe atmosphere where we can show off these strong, empowered women doing something that allows them to act out however they want,” she said. “You can be sexy, strong funny—you create a character. The best part is seeing these expressions come out on stage. It's more about performance than the actual arm wrestling.”


The next NOLAW brawl is set for Dec. 12 at One Eyed Jacks. Arnold’s photographs will be on display in the exhibition, “Katrina Arnold: Wrists Up” at New Orleans’ Gradoux Gallery as part of PhotoNOLA from Dec. 4 through Dec. 7.

Slate,L,Holiday season hacking: Beware of malware and phishing in order confirmation emails.,"Ordering gifts online for family and friends this holiday season? Inbox inundated with confirmation emails? You could be the perfect target for holiday hackers.

Brian Krebs at Krebs on Security is warning that consumers be on high alert this month for malicious links and attachments in emails purporting to ""confirm"" online orders. ""Malware purveyors and spammers are blasting these missives by the millions each day in a bid to trick people into giving up control over their computers and identities,"" Krebs writes. His post shows a series of somewhat convincing malware emails that appear to come from Home Depot, Walmart, Target, and Costco.

Holiday hacking is a perennial problem for both customers and retailers. As transaction volume rises, retailers will often lower their fraud controls so that the sales can continue apace. This creates a window for hackers to strike and get away undetected. Krebs notes that the particular breed of ""order confirmation"" spam emails tends to start around Thanksgiving and run through the end of the winter holidays. The phishing attacks use ""both booby-trapped links and attached files"" to put malware on computers that can then pull passwords and other important information from the machines.



Huge security breaches have already hit JPMorgan Chase and Home Depot this year. Last winter, Target suffered an attack that compromised the credit and debit cards of 40 million people and the personal information of 70 million. From January through the end November, a record 696 data breaches were reported and nearly 81.5 million records exposed, according to data from the Identity Theft Resource Center. The previous record for most breaches in a year was 662 breaches in 2010.


So go ahead and shop online for the holidays. But when the order confirmations start to pile up, be very, very careful about what you end up clicking.

Slate,L,Transparent’s Zackary Drucker wants to archive Flawless Sabrina’s lifework.,"Back in October, Outward ran a piece from Stephen Vider on the opening credits for Transparent, the critically acclaimed Amazon show that follows the story of Maura (an older transgender woman) and her coming-out process. Vider unearthed a wonderful bit of queer history hiding in the frames: Segments from The Queen, a seminal but largely unseen documentary about drag queens and trans people from 1968, were cut into the montage, helping it show “how trans identities and communities have evolved, both in the decades since the documentary’s release and over the years of Maura’s life.” In the piece, Vider also wrote about the main force behind The Queen, Flawless Sabrina (aka Jack Doroshow), a drag performer and activst who ran the groundbreaking pageant documented in the film.

Vider’s coverage necessarily focused on that particular aspect of Flawless’ life, but The Queen was only the beginning of the queen's illustrious career. As Zackary Drucker, an associate producer on Transparent and “grandchild” of Flawless’, points out in an ongoing Kickstarter project to archive her grandmother’s “lifework,” Flawless “is a living legend in the queer community who has worked tirelessly for decades shaping culture to be safer for LGBT people.”

Along with Diana Tourjee—a writer who is working on a book about Flawless—Drucker is raising funds to enable the cataloging and preservation of the masses of historically significant art, documents, and other artifacts that currently reside in the queen’s small New York apartment. This is both to help her downsize and to make the materials available to scholars, activists, and other parties interested in the history of gender and countercultures. Additionally, the archive will include extensive oral history interviews with Flawless.  


Having had the privilege of spending a number of stimulating afternoons on the far side of Flawless’ desk, I can vouch for the supreme importance of this project. Sources of LGBTQ history are precious, so when we are presented with both a treasure trove and a generous, intelligent elder who is willing to help us understand it all, we should jump at the opportunity. The fundraising campaign will run until Monday, Dec. 8.

Slate,L,"The Unspeakable: And Other Subjects of Discussion, an essay collection, by Meghan Daum, reviewed.","There’s something both enticing and paradoxical about calling your book of personal revelations The Unspeakable, especially when you tack on a winking subtitle like And Other Subjects of Discussion. The name of Meghan Daum’s new essay collection promises transgression and absolute candor, pledging that what’s unsayable won’t be left unsaid. You can just hear the breathless, cheesy tagline The Unspeakable might have if it were not an essay collection but instead a movie from the 1950s: These shocking truths were shrouded in mystery … until now!

Slate,L,"Pink slugs, drunken parrots, giant earthworms, and tree lobsters of Australia.","Atlas Obscura on Slate is a blog about the world's hidden wonders. Like us on Facebook and Tumblr, or follow us on Twitter.

Australia is renowned for being being filled with dangerous animals that can’t wait to kill you. Snakes, spiders, sharks, box jellyfish, and blue-ringed octopuses are but a few of the fauna that have the power to end you. But the country is also home to a menagerie of vibrant and fascinating creatures that are much more benign—at least to humans. Here are five of them.


The Giant Pink Slugs of Mount Kaputar
Mount Kaputar, an alpine peak in the southeastern state of New South Wales, is home to a plucky band of neon-pink slugs. Resembling glistening strips of raw tuna, these slugs can grow to over 7 inches long. They usually hide out under the leaves whose mold they feed upon, but at night they emerge by the hundreds, slithering around in search of tasty moss.

The slugs are the most striking residents of Mount Kaputar, but by no means the only unusual animal. Three species of cannibalistic snails live on the mountain, always chasing after one another’s slime trails.


The Drunk Parrots of the Northern Territory
Australia’s binge-drinking culture is not confined to its human inhabitants. Every October, when the wet season arrives in Australia’s north, drunk parrots begin falling from the trees. The birds are red-collared lorikeets who feed on fermented fruit and get, in the words of Australian Geographic, “completely sloshed, and sometimes for days at a time.”

            }
        });
         

Rotten fruit may not the sole reason the parrots get blotto. The lethargy and loss of coordination could also be symptoms of a virus that vets have not yet been able to identify. Whatever the cause, the effects are serious: The birds can die if left untreated. (As with human hangovers, treatment involves hydration, rest, and comfort food.)


The Giant Earthworms of Gippsland
The Gippsland earthworms are so big that when they were discovered in the 1870s they were initially mistaken for snakes. Inhabiting the blue-gray clay of Gippsland in the state of Victoria, the earthworms are an average of 1 inch wide and 3 feet long, but in rare, horrifying instances, can exceed 9 feet.  


The worms spend most of their lives buried deep in their burrows, where they squelch around in the wet earth making impressive gurgling sounds. This clip from David Attenborough’s BBC series Life in the Undergrowth provides an intimate portrait of the earthworms.


&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;


The Lobsterlike Stick Insects of Ball’s Pyramid
Ball’s Pyramid, an 1,844-foot sea spire 12 miles off the east coast of Australia, is hardly lush with vegetation—it is almost entirely rock, its near-vertical cliff faces inhospitable to fauna and off-limits to mountain climbers without government permission. But in 2001, scientists scaling the rock found something wonderful: a nest of 24 Lord Howe stick insects, a lobster-esque species long thought to be extinct.

        requirejs([""jquery""], function($) {

            }
        });
         

In 2003 a team from the National Parks and Wildlife Service scaled the pyramid and collected two pairs of stick insects for breeding in captivity. One pair died shortly after, but the pair dispatched to Melbourne Zoo—“Adam and Eve”—met with success, producing eggs that became the foundation of the zoo’s now thousands-strong tree lobster population.


The Seething Crab Hordes of Christmas Island
For most of the year, the red crabs of Christmas Island, an Australian territory located to the country’s northwest, wander the forests unobtrusively. But when the wet season arrives in October, the crabs stream toward the ocean to breed and lay eggs, turning the ground, grass, and roads into a crawling red carpet.

            }
        });
         

The crabs have a tiny but lethal enemy: yellow crazy ants, which were introduced to the island in the 1920s and have since wreaked havoc on its ecosystem. The ants shoot jets of formic acid into the crabs’ eyes, causing harm or even death. Yellow crazy ants have been such a menace to Christmas Island’s ecology that the Australian government established a seven-member Crazy Ant Scientific Advisory Panel in order to come up with harm-reduction strategies. Ant super-colonies were blasted with insecticide in 2009, but the little blighters’ numbers are rising again.

Slate,L,Dr. Ben Carson blames feminism and the 60s for police shootings of unarmed black men.,"When cops gun down unarmed black men (or, in some cases, children), conservatives cast around desperately for someone besides the actual triggerman to blame. Now conservative commentator and Fox News stalwart Dr. Ben Carson has stumbled on an exciting anyone-but-the-shooter scapegoat: feminists. Carson was being interviewed by phone on American Family Radio’s “Today’s Issues” to elaborate on his theory that police shootings are the result of insufficient deference to authority on the part of young black men.

Slate,L,Slate recommendations: Favorite media recommendations from staffers this Thanksgiving. ,"In true Thanksgiving tradition, Slate Plus asked Slate staffers to share what they’re most thankful for in the media world this year. Here are the websites, podcasts, apps, and more that Slate-sters said filled them up with gratitude.

June Thomas, culture critic and Outward editor


I’ve been a stationery nerd for as long as I can remember, but 2014 was the year I discovered a genre that marries two of my great loves: writing instruments and podcasts. The Pen Addict podcast is more than two years old, but every week pen blogger Brad Dowdy and podcast entrepreneur Myke Hurley, spend an hour or so prattling on delightfully about “the analogue tools we love so dearly.” A newer arrival on the scene is Erasable, a biweekly show “by and for those who love wooden pencils.” The three hosts—Johnny Gamber, Tim Wasem, and Andy Welfie—are graphite-obsessed, funny, and great company.

Laura Helmuth, science and health editor


This Thanksgiving, I am grateful for science Twitter. There’s a huge community of science writers, students, scientists, and others who just love talking on Twitter about science and who use Twitter very effectively to stick up for science and justice. One of my favorite recent science Twitter eruptions was Manicure Monday, when scientists hijacked a Seventeen magazine hashtag to show off all the fun stuff you can do with your hands that doesn’t involve nail polish. More recently, after an astronomer wore a sexy ladies shirt while announcing the landing of a spacecraft on a comet, science Twitter came up with a great hashtag, #scishirt, for scientists to show off their geekiest, funniest, nonsexist-iest shirts. Speaking of which, I need to go tweet a photo of my Teach the Controversy T-shirts.


Katy Waldman, words correspondent


Two podcasts I’m loving (and I’m sure I’m very late to both of them!): Nerdette, hosted by Greta Johnsen and Tricia Bobeda, and Pitch, from Whitney Jones and Alex Kapelman. The first is just fascinating, good-humored interviews with the creators of nerd culture—defined broadly as anything you might get excited about—and the second is music history and theory plus lovely, evocative production. (Don't miss the delightful episode in which second-graders create sound poems by interpreting wiggly lines as vocal scores!) 


Aisha Harris, staff writer


I am thankful for the site http://genekellysbutt.tumblr.com/. Anyone who’s ever watched a Gene Kelly movie can attest to the wonderfulness that is (was?) his posterior. That such a shrine to one of cinema’s greatest gifts actually exists is a testament to the social good the Internet can accomplish.


Jeff Friedrich, associate editor


I’m thankful for Jesse Brown’s Canadaland podcast! Forthright, smart, kinda righteous-sounding interviews and media criticism, from a Canadian perspective.


David Plotz, host of Slate’s Political Gabfest


I’m thankful this year, as in so many years, for Jason Kottke and Kottke.org. He finds what I want to find before I know I want to find it. And he doesn’t make a big production out of it: It’s simple, smart, and clean. 


Laura Anderson, assistant editor


I am thankful for Carolyn Hax, who, despite having written an advice column for the Washington Post for 17 years straight, continues to give consistently wonderful, wise, witty advice in her column and weekly chats. 


Dan Kois, culture editor


I am thankful for Clickhole. Nearly every day, the Onion’s new parody viral site (and viral parody site) publishes something that makes me laugh while simultaneously throwing my hands up in the air like LOL NOTHING MATTERS.


Rachael Larimore, senior editor


For years, I’ve been resentful of Pinterest. It’s the territory in the mommy wars that has been staked out by smug stay-at-home moms who can craft homemade, hand-sculpted, multitiered birthday cakes. With rolled fondant! I effing hate fondant. But then I told my youngest son, 5, that I would make him a Minecraft Halloween costume. Not a terribly hard task—cardboard boxes, colored duct tape, a few hours of time—but time consuming, and I wanted some tips. So I sucked it up and actually registered. Pinned a few things. Survived Halloween. But as it turns out, there are plenty of things to check out on Pinterest that are not in any way smug or obnoxious. And as the mom of three picky eaters, I’m happy to search for recipes without trekking back and forth to the library for cookbooks. Even if they end up appealing only to me. Plus, there are cocktails. 


Betsy Woodruff, staff writer


I am profoundly grateful for the Umbrella app. It’s one of the few apps on my phone that I actually paid for (I think it was $2), and it’s more than worth it. The app sends an alert in the morning if it’s going to rain and, thus, if I should bring an umbrella to work. Life before this app was bleak, fraught, risky, and often drenched. Now that I have it, I no longer make frantic sprints to CVS to buy crappy $8 umbrellas that fall apart after three uses. I don’t know what this says about my life, but Umbrella has genuinely improved it. 


Abby McIntyre, copy editor


This year I‘m thankful for discovering, by way of their excellent book #Newsfail, the daily podcast Citizen Radio. Filled in equal parts with hilarious improv bits and radical progressive politics, it‘s an incredibly fun way to get an outside-the-mainstream look at the day’s news.


Ayana Morali, executive producer of Slate Video


The Discovery reality show Alaska: The Last Frontier is AMAZEBALLS.


Chris Kirk, interactives editor


Sure, the podcast renaissance is spawning great new podcasts like Serial and The Gist, but sometimes the old stuff works just as well. It’s a good thing Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History podcast has been around since 2006; Carlin brings harsh, appalling history to life, and after you finish his latest series on World War I, you'll find yourself plunging into those eight years of archives—and even paying for old episodes, for another fix. You’ll not only come away with a fascination with history you haven’t felt since you had that one hippie-haired history teacher in high school, you’ll feel a new appreciation for the modern world and its relatively trivial worries.


Jennifer Lai, associate editor


This year, I’m eternally grateful to Pocket, a free read-it-later app that has truly saved me from countless hours of heartbreak and frustration. Before discovering Pocket, I always felt overwhelmed by all of the articles I wanted to read later—there was never really a way to save them all in one easily accessible place, and it drove me insane. Email was clumsy, bookmarks never synced correctly, and neither of those solutions could be taken offline. Pocket essentially solved the question: “Now, what was that article again?” At the risk of sounding way too smitten with an app, Pocket has even changed my commute home—after work, I open up the app on my phone and voilà! All of the articles I’ve saved over the course of the day are ready for my long offline commute home. And if I want to pick up reading on my laptop when I get home, I can do that. Technology is magic!


Forrest Wickman, staff writer

Slate,L,Orion launch: Watch live.,"Update, Dec. 4, 2014, at 14:50 UTC: After a morning fraught with problems, the Orion launch was scrubbed for today and will be attempted at the same time tomorrow: 12:05 UTC (07:05 Eastern time) Friday, Dec. 5. The first problem was a boat in the red zone in the waters off the Cape, and after that was cleared the winds picked up, violating limits. The countdown resumed several times, but then a problem with fuel valves in the tanks held things up. Cycling the valves (essentailly turning them on and off again five times) cleared the problem for the liquid oxygen tanks, but not the liquid hydrogen tanks. The problem took too long to solve and the timer ran up against the end of the launch window, so the attempt was scrubbed. 

NASA's Orion test capsule is scheduled to launch on a powerful Delta IV Heavy rocket at 12:05 UTC (07:05 Eastern) today. That's 5:05 in the morning for me in Colorado, so I figure there's a chance I may not wake up in time to see it. Just in case, I'm posting this article early and embedding NASA's UStream channel here so y'all have a comfortable place to kick back and watch for yourself. You can try NASA TV as well.

The launch window is more than two hours long, so even if it doesn't launch on time it may still go up today. The mission itself (rounding the Earth twice and then splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California) is four and a half hours long, so there's plenty of time to catch it. 


As I hear more (and get some coffee in me), I'll update this post.

Slate,L,New No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA from Google is much easier for humans.,"Interpreting the textual Rorschach test known as CAPTCHA is a time-honored tradition for Internet users. For years, we have cocked our heads like confused parrots, puzzling over the skewed letter-number combinations. Back in 2012, Slate predicted the death of the much-reviled authentication technology. Software companies created artificial intelligence capable of breaking it. Its days seemed to be numbered. But like a resilient phoenix, CAPTCHA has risen again. And this time it isn’t so bad.

On Wednesday, Google’s Online Security Blog announced an upgrade to the old CAPTCHA. Called “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA,” the new technology uses an “Advanced Risk Analysis backend” that monitors user engagement before, during, and after the CAPTCHA process. (reCAPTCHA is simply a version of the original software application in which user input helped computer programs to digitize books.) Nonmobile users simply click a box that reads “I’m not a robot,” and the new API does its thing. (Somewhere, a spam-bot is crying digital tears.) Google doesn’t go into the nitty-gritty of how the risk analysis tools work, but it seems pretty confident about the new approach.


    Advertisement




To rescue mobile users from fumbling around with phone keyboards, Google developed something reminiscent of childhood matching games. Users will be given an image and asked to match it to a series of different images. For example, you may see a rubber duck. Underneath it you’ll see five photos of rubber ducks, and four photos of former Vice President Dan Quayle. Simply tap on the ducks, and you’re done. (Google’s blog used turkeys and kittens to illustrate this.) Fun! Once you’ve finished and clean up, you can have butter cookies and apple juice.


But user beware: The old CAPTCHA isn’t yet dead. If the new version cannot determine whether the user is human, it’s back to the jumbled text you know and love. It seems as long as spam-bots roam the Internet, we will have to keep proving our humanity.


Google explains the new process more in the video below.

Slate,L,U.S. Department of Education comes out in support of transgender students' rights.,"On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education released a long-awaited, much-needed guidance document for elementary and secondary schools that offer or want to offer single-sex classes.

Included within the document was an important protection for transgender students that should not be overlooked. The guidance states clearly that transgender students must be allowed to participate in single-sex classes consistent with their gender identity. (In other words, consistent with who they are.) This latest positive breakthrough builds on guidance released earlier this year that made it explicitly clear, for the first time, that Title IX extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity.

The need for this clarifying direction to schools across the country could not have been clearer.


As the ACLU has repeatedly documented, and fought, far too many single-sex programs are based on discredited “science” that is rooted in outdated and harmful gender stereotypes. For example, teachers have been instructed that girls should not have time limits on tests because, unlike boys, girls' brains cannot function well under these conditions. On the flip side, teachers have been told to firmly discipline boys who like to read, do not enjoy contact sports, and do not have a lot of close male friends by requiring them to spend time with “normal males” and to play sports.


These kinds of sweeping generalizations are especially harmful to students who do not conform to rigid gender stereotypes, including LGBTQ students. Indeed, such generalizations and stereotypes are precisely the sort of discrimination that Title IX was intended to eliminate more than four decades ago, and they should have no place in our public education system today. The guidance released on Monday is clear that schools cannot rely on these kinds of harmful stereotypes.


These recent actions from the Department of Education are important steps forward, but there is still more to do. The Department of Education should release comprehensive guidance for schools nationwide explaining how Title IX protects transgender and gender nonconforming students from discrimination and what steps schools need to take to be in compliance with the law and meet their obligations to these students.


All students deserve the opportunity to attend school free from discrimination because of who they are, including stereotypes about how “normal” boys and girls learn.

Slate,L,"Derrick Rose, injuries: NBA stars aren't superheroes. They break just like the rest of us puny humans.","When the Cleveland Cavaliers open their season at home on Thursday night, fans will once again gaze upon a 10-story-tall, Nike-sponsored banner of Akron’s favorite son, LeBron James. The new LeBronvertisement will hang in the same spot that James’ iconic “We Are All Witnesses” billboard fluttered until a certain ill-fated television special in 2010, and its presence will suggest a righted universe. Basketball’s greatest living practitioner is back where he belongs, looming godlike over his adoring city. It will be a welcome sight for both Cleveland and the NBA itself, a league whose players have recently been dropping like—well, if not flies, at least mortal beings.

This Tuesday, the NBA’s opening night began with rising star Anthony Davis blocking nine shots and ended with rookie Julius Randle getting carried off the court with a broken leg. The sequence of events felt like a microcosm of NBA life: intoxicating promise chased by harsh reality, supermen unburdened by gravity until they’re collapsed in pain on the floor.


In any sports league, the dawn of a new season is typically a time for hope, when every fan outside of the greater Philadelphia area believes his favorite team could be a contender if everything breaks right. This year, though, a lot broke wrong before the season began. When Indiana’s All-Star small forward Paul George fractured his tibia during a Team USA scrimmage in August, the immediate (and probably correct) consensus was that his gruesome injury would kill the upcoming season of a Pacers team just a few months removed from the Eastern Conference Finals. Oklahoma City forward and reigning MVP Kevin Durant is now indefinitely scooter-bound and set to miss the first part of the season with a broken foot. Unlike the Pacers, no one expects Durant’s Thunder to suffer too much in his absence, as the team boasts a second superstar in point guard Russell Westbrook—albeit a superstar who’s had three knee surgeries himself over the past two years, and just last season missed 36 games.


    Advertisement




The NBA and its corporate partners have long encouraged fantasies of the league’s stars as superhuman. Michael Jordan went to space. Charles Barkley posted up Godzilla. Superhero capes have passed from Shaquille O’Neal to Dwight Howard to Blake Griffin. But more and more, such imagery invites cognitive dissonance. It’s not just George, Durant, and Westbrook who’ve crashed to Earth. Adidas’ Derrick Rose bullfighting spot from 2012 already feels hopelessly dated in light of the Bulls star’s knee troubles, and watching the oft-hobbled Dwyane Wade in a 2010, Iron Man-inspired Nike commercial is either cringe-inducing or laughter-inducing, depending on your allegiances.


It’s tempting to see Rose as the exemplar of the fickleness of NBA life. Point guard is the premier position in today’s NBA, and every team salivates over finding the next otherworldly athlete to man the position. Rose is, or was, at the vanguard of this movement, a breathtaking mix of explosiveness and controlled power who became the youngest MVP in league history just three years ago. Two major injuries later, it’s hard not to wonder if all this leaping of tall buildings broke him down in ways we couldn’t see. Maybe the reason that 99.9 percent of human bodies can’t do things like this is that human bodies aren’t really supposed to. In Wright Thompson’s recent ESPN the Magazine profile, Rose comes across as nothing if not fragile—physically, psychically, emotionally.


But anyone looking for the starkest illustration of the precariousness of the league’s health, in every sense, should look to Cleveland’s literal poster child, LeBron James himself. For 12 seasons, King James has been the NBA’s crowning asset, a player whose immense gifts have made him its most potent fantasy object since Michael Jordan. The most games James has ever missed in a season is seven. He’s missed only 44 in his whole career—just 11 more than the Pelicans’ Davis, who is a mere 21 years old.


The more distressing side of this is that James has played more minutes than anyone in basketball since the 2010–11 season, with the pre-scooter Durant a close second. As ESPN.com’s Tom Haberstroh noted last April, “Over the past three and a half years, James and Durant have essentially crammed in an extra NBA season compared to the rest of the league.” And that was written before LeBron led the Miami Heat to their fourth consecutive trip to the finals. The center cannot hold, as someone once said, and they weren’t talking about the Cavs’ notoriously gimpy pivotman Anderson Varejao. If LeBron ends up rolling around Cleveland on a scooter, that would be very bad for the Cavs, the NBA, basketball fans, and everyone else who doesn’t own stock in the company that manufactured said scooter.


Superstar injuries in the NBA are nothing new—Magic, Bird, and Jordan each missed long stretches either during or near their respective primes—and it’s hard to say if basketball is a more dangerous sport now than in generations past. In the post-lockout years of 2012 and 2013 there appeared to be a discernible spike in ACL tears, which felled stars such as Rose, the Celtics’ Rajon Rondo, and the Timberwolves’ Ricky Rubio, as well as role players like Iman Shumpert and Lou Williams. This trend has since been refuted, even as other knee injuries have recently hampered Westbrook (torn meniscus), Kobe Bryant (lateral tibial plateau fracture), and Rose yet again (torn mensicus).


But in an era of fantasy leagues, up-to-the-minute smartphone notifications, and Byzantine salary cap rules, injuries loom over the league and its fans as never before. Players and coaches are acutely aware of this. In recent weeks, the Mavericks’ Dirk Nowitzki, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, and LeBron James himself have publicly advocated for a shortened season. Michael Jordan, as you’d expect, offered up a “kids today” rebuttal from the owner’s box, remarking, “If I wasn't playing 82 games, I still would've been playing somewhere else because that's the love for the game I had.” (Jordan’s former minor-league baseball teammates could not be reached for comment.)


The NBA, eager to protect its stars but loath to sacrifice the box-office rewards of an 82-game schedule, recently experimented with a 44-minute preseason game, which clocked in at a brisk two hours. But such flirtations are half-hearted Band-Aids. The grind of the league is less about a few extra minutes per night than it is about games played on back-to-back nights, overnight flights, and interminable winter road trips. And who’s to say a 44-minute game would actually cut into a superstar’s minutes total? Last year’s leader in time served, Carmelo Anthony, played 38.7 minutes per game. Even with a shortened game clock, why would the Knicks’ Derek Fisher, a first-year coach of a bad team in a brutal media market, have any incentive to play him less?


Luckily for him and everyone who loves watches him play, LeBron may have been granted a reprieve from this grueling cycle. David Blatt, the Cavs’ first-year coach, has suggested that LeBron might see his minutes curtailed this season. Cleveland fans should hope that he follows through on that strategy. Nobody’s going to hang a 10-story banner of LeBron James sitting on the bench. But for James to stay in full flight for as long as possible, he’ll need to stay grounded for long enough that the rigors of pro basketball don’t grind him down.

Slate,L,Terminator: Genisys trailer: Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in the franchise reboot (VIDEO).,"Following 2009’s “loud and dull” Terminator: Salvation, the franchise will get a reboot of sorts with next year’s Terminator: Genisys. Though after seeing the first trailer, I’m more inclined to call it a remix than a reboot.

It starts off with a familiar storyline: John Connor (Jason Clarke), several years in the future, has tasked lieutenant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) with the mission of going back to 1984 and saving his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke, aka Daenerys Targaryen), from the Terminator sent to kill her to prevent John’s crucial leadership in the rebellion. When Kyle arrives, Sarah repeats the franchise’s classic catchphrase, “Come with me if you wanna live.” So far, this feels like a fairly straightforward recreation of The Terminator.

But then Sarah informs Kyle that “we” have already destroyed the T-800 that’s after her—the “we” being her and Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing a future version of the T-800, who has blown his younger self to smithereens. After that, things get weird: Sarah explains to Kyle that “everything’s changed” and that, in some strange alternate course of events, they’ve figured out a way to stop Judgment Day from happening. There’s even a brief scene that suggests Sarah was taken under the Terminator’s wing as a child.


So are we supposed to disregard the previous films in the franchise before seeing this latest edition, or watch them all over again so we can tell what in the world is going on? Hopefully, things become a bit clearer when Terminator: Genisys opens July 1, 2015.

Slate,L,Cosby lawsuit claims extortion by Judy Huth.,"Bill Cosby has been largely silent over the past several weeks as the sexual assault allegations against the comedian continued to pile up. While Cosby, through his lawyer, has generally dismissed the claims as false through his lawyer Marty Singer, on Thursday Cosby’s legal team pushed back on the recent accusation leveled by Judy Huth. In a court filing this week, Huth said she was sexually abused by Cosby at the Playboy Mansion in 1974 when she was only 15 years old.

Cosby attorney Marty Singer accused Huth of extortion in a court filing on Thursday. “Cosby says Huth's lawyer approached the comedian's attorney, Marty Singer, last month and made ‘ominous references’ to 'criminal penalties.’” ABC News reports. “According to the lawsuit, Huth's lawyer demanded $100,000 for her silence, and later increased the amount to $250,000 as additional women came forward.”

Judy Huth is the first woman to file a lawsuit against the comedian in the latest round of accusations. The nearly two dozen other claims against Cosby are decades-old and have exceeded the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes. Huth, however, who was underage at the time, “used a portion of California law that allows for a lawsuit to be filed three years after a child sex crime is discovered to have caused damages,” according to Reuters.


While Cosby has so far avoided any legal repercussions for the alleged assaults, his silence on the mounting allegations has decimated his public image. Upcoming projects with NBC and Netflix have been cancelled, Cosby has resigned from the board of Temple University, and on Thursday the Navy revoked an honorary title from Cosby as a consequence of the allegations. Cosby served four years in the Navy and in 2011 was given the title of honorary Chief Petty Officer.

Slate,L,Darren Wilson “no true bill”: Why cops are almost never indicted for shooting someone in the line of duty.,"A St. Louis County grand jury spent more than three months hearing evidence about the shooting death of Michael Brown.

That result would have been exceedingly rare if Wilson were a regular citizen. Because he was a cop the outcome was close to inevitable.

Slate,L,Science shows you're better off being a nice boss.,"This article originally appeared in Inc.

In Hebrew, there's a concept called ""distance"" that refers to keeping a distance between a subordinate and the person in charge. So, for example, a lieutenant in the army treats his soldiers with ""distance,"" refraining from getting too friendly with them.


    Advertisement




That concept often carries over into the business world, with bosses assuming that they need to keep a sense of distance from their employees in order to maintain a hierarchy at the company that fosters respect and hard work. You don't want your employees to forget who's in charge, and you don't want to seem too soft.


But as Stanford University's Emma Seppälä points out in the Harvard Business Review, this probably isn't the best way to approach leadership. For one, being a tough, distant leader often adds stress to your employees, which is proven to harm your employees' health and increase the likelihood of them quitting. A report from BMC Public Health shows that health care expenditures were 46 percent greater for employees with high levels of stress. Another study shows how occupational stress leads to employee turnover.


On the other hand, research shows that being a nice boss can be incredibly beneficial for both employees and a business. A study from the University of Kent at Canterbury finds that being altruistic can actually increase your status in a group. Other research from Harvard Business School's Amy Cuddy explains that leaders who project warmth earn their employees' trust and as a result are more effective than tough leaders. Then there's another study that shows that a leader's good attitude can spread to his or her team and cause them to be more civil and productive.


Seppälä points to additional studies that show other benefits of being a kind leader: Employees will feel more loyal and committed, will be more likely to help their co-workers, will treat customers better, will be less stressed overall, and will even have better health.


""A good boss may literally be good for the heart,"" writes Seppälä, the associate director of Stanford's Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education.


Now that the importance of being a nice boss has been established, it's important to recognize what that actually means. It might translate into offering perks to your employees, like being able to work from home or extra vacation time. But it also means that you simply have to treat employees with respect and kindness and show a true commitment to values, ethics, and self-sacrifice.

""Creating a leadership model of trust and mutual cooperation may help create a culture that is happier, in which employees help each other, and (as a consequence) become more productive in the long run,"" Seppälä writes. ""No wonder their nice bosses get promoted.""

Slate,L,Fox Host Carlson hopes New York City tree lighting unaffected by Garner protests. ,"Protesters quickly took to the streets in New York City on Wednesday after a Staten Island grand jury chose not to indict police officer David Pantaleo for choking Eric Garner to death. In the immediate aftermath of the decision, Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson, reported the grand jury decision to viewers, before moving on to the issue of potential protests. There have been ongoing protests in Times Square over the Darren Wilson grand jury decision last week, Carlson points out. Then, unfortunately, she keeps talking: “I certainly hope nothing’s going to happen here in New York City today and we’ve got the tree lighting ceremony.” Despite Carlson’s concern, the Rockefeller Center tree lighting ceremony she mentioned in the segment is still on.

At least that’s what my analysis of recent Slate commenting data suggests. In September, for example, 99 percent of all Slate readers did not comment on any Slate article they read. Most readers just aren’t commenters. No need to bury our lede.


As a result, most conversations below Slate articles are small. Slate has published more than 12,000 pieces since the beginning of 2014. Only 12 percent of those pieces attracted participation from more than 100 individual commenters. In comparison, the average Slate article attracts many thousands of readers—or at least clickers.





Yes, often the comment icon at the top of an article displays a number greater than 100. But that’s a measure of comments, not unique commenters; the icon’s count may double, triple, or infinity count those commenters who have much to say. That’s true of one of Slate’s most-commented pieces of 2014, “The Rise of the Ironic Man-Hater” by Amanda Hess; it garnered about 4,900 comments from only 343 commenters, meaning the average commenter left about 14 comments below the article.





Slate articles almost never engage more than 1 percent of their readers as commenters. It’s a small crowd, but that doesn’t seem unusual. Across many types of websites, it’s often observed that there are many more people consuming content than creating it. Some people have referred to this a 1 percent rule of Internet participation.


So the odds are against you. You will probably not comment on this piece.

Dear Prudence,
My husband is all the usual things: Smart! Funny! Caring! He has, however, turned into a horrible gift giver. He used to be quite creative, but our lives have become busier as we’ve become older. We have a child, a house, and more demanding careers. I’m not looking for extravagant gifts, I’m just looking for a little consideration and I know he has it in him. For the price of the half-dead grocery store flowers I received on our recent anniversary, I would have loved to have been taken out to my favorite bar for a drink. This wouldn’t be a big problem, except for the fact that we are hosting the holidays this year. My entire family will be with us on Christmas morning. I’m still smarting from the flowers, and I’m afraid if I open another so-so gift I’ll cry! We are a really close family and they’ll be able to read my face no matter how hard I try to keep it in check. We also are the kind of family that opens each present painfully slowly and ohh and ahh over every one. Should I bring this up with my spouse, and how do I not sound shallow?

—No Poker Face


Dear Poker,
Your husband is not all the usual things. From my inbox the usual things are Addicted to Porn! Chronically Unemployed! Volatile Temper! So your husband is a gem, one who remembered your anniversary. My husband is a gem too, and when he surprised me with the last bouquet of half-dead subway flowers for Valentine’s Day, I was thrilled. It’s true I’m insensitive and not a gift person, but I understand that other people are gift persons. I even know about The 5 Love Languages and that “receiving gifts” is one of them. Of course, if I were married to such a love-language person, that would make me want to cite another love language, “words of affirmation,” and say to you, “Stop being such a pain about gifts.” There seems to be two issues here: One is that you want thoughtful gifts from your husband, the other is that you expect him to read your mind. So speak up. If you wanted to go to your favorite bar for you anniversary, in advance of it you should have told him and arranged for a babysitter. You have an opportunity this Christmas to tell him what you want. You can even hand him a catalog with an item circled in pen, or show him the website where he can order the leather tote you’ve been desiring. Then, when your family indulges in its fetishistic gift opening practices, you will not have to worry about your chin quivering like Claire Danes’ on Homeland.

Dear Prudence,
Our 3-year-old son was diagnosed with a terminal, incurable, degenerative disease several months ago. The doctors told us he has a very limited amount of “good” time left. My husband and I were fortunate enough to be able to take several months of leave from our jobs to spend time with him and take fun trips. Family even moved back to the area to be around him more. Our community has been wonderful and supportive. The issue is my 16-year-old stepdaughter. She lives three hours away and is only here once a month at best, less than her court-mandated visitation. She loves her brother but she has told us that she doesn’t want to get closer to him because it will hurt more when he dies. My husband has talked to her about how there will be time for dealing with the pain later, about the importance of building memories, and how she will likely regret this, but it hasn’t helped. We try to get her here for major events, but it takes a lot of stressful coordination with her mother who always acts as if she is doing a favor to let her come. There’s a family party before Christmas, but she’s not coming. We were told she will only be here for a few days after Christmas. Our therapist told us to let her know about what we have planned but that we can’t force her to come. My husband and I are both very hurt and sad that her brother, who probably will never get to know another sibling, is deprived of time with her. What can we do?


—A Worried Mom


Dear Worried,
I am so sorry for your heartbreak. In terrible circumstances like these, sometimes it helps to deflect your pain onto something else, to help turn away from what’s coming. So while your complaint is legitimate, it may even be a relief to be able to brood over the behavior of a teenager and her cold mother. It’s good to hear you have a therapist and she sounds like a wise one. You’re doing all you can do—telling this girl that you would like her to come, and then leaving it up to her. There is no creature on earth more self-involved than a 16-year-old. But even the most selfless one would have a hard time facing the impending death of a little brother and absorbing the anguish of the adults who love him. Sure, if your stepdaughter were different, she would be doing everything possible to spend every moment with a brother she loves and knows she’s going to lose. Maybe someday, when she’s less under the influence of her mother, she will reflect and feel a deep sense of remorse over what she didn’t do. But worrying about that is not something you should be wasting your emotional energy on. I would urge you to let this go, but if occasionally venting about this with your husband takes your mind off other things, then allow yourself that small indulgence. But as you do so, be careful not to make this frustrating girl the focus of your pain.


—Prudie




Dear Prudence,
About six months ago, I got hired at an amazing company and couldn’t have been happier about leaving my old job and its craziness behind. I love the atmosphere and people at my new job but there’s one little problem. In my cubicle area, which I share with three people, I am surrounded by extremely loud eaters. One of my co-workers slurps his coffee so loudly I assume other people around us can hear but just don’t say anything. The other two co-workers chomp on sandwiches or gobble up pasta and other assorted foods so loudly that sometimes I have to get up from my desk and pretend to need to use the restroom. Am I the problem, am I just too sensitive to people’s eating habits? Or is there a way I can ask them to quiet down without becoming the uptight new girl?


—Stop Chewing


Dear Stop,
Have I got a diagnosis for you! (I keep promising I will stop practicing medicine on the Internet, but I just found out about this disorder, and I can’t help myself.) Read this article on misphonia, a newly identified condition in which people are driven bonkers by selective sounds, usually produced by specific people. So your spouse’s chewing drives you insane or your co-worker’s pen clicking fills you with homicidal rage. It’s possible fate has dropped you in a pod of people lacking in cubicle manners, but hitting three out of three seems unlikely. With that and the description of the Dolby-quality pasta chewing, I’m suspicious the issue is you. You are the new girl who made a timely escape from a miserable job. If you want to keep things happy, you will not tell the people near you that when they eat and drink—anything!—you have run to the bathroom to keep from screaming. The article says that noise-canceling headphones might help, or maybe you can occasionally turn on a soft white-noise machine. Perhaps learning meditation will help you live with the fact that you work at an office where everyone’s lunch is lip-smacking good.


—Prudie


Dear Prudence,
My husband and I have a happy marriage of more than a decade, two kids, two cats, and a lovely home. We have a large extended family we enjoy bringing together for holidays and celebrations. The problem is my father-in-law and his wife. They are wealthy people with several homes and we rarely see them except for the holidays. When they come to our house they bring their German shepherd dogs, which they leave in their car with the windows slightly open. Over Thanksgiving anyone walking by the car, including our guests, was greeted by the dogs barking aggressively and shaking the car. On the rare occasion that we have been invited to one of their homes, the dogs have gotten aggressive with the children. My niece was bitten on her thigh, and my then 5-year-old son was barked into a creek by one of the dogs, and I had to rescue him. No one seemed to care. We’ve invited the in-laws to our home for Christmas to avoid any confrontation with the dogs. But now they bring the dogs with them! My husband hands me a cocktail and tells me to ignore them. We have argued about it, and my husband says I don’t want him to have a relationship with his father. Of course I do or I wouldn’t put up with their nonsense for all these years! I can’t drink away their visits. I want to insist that they don’t bring the dogs. Any suggestions?


—Dog Gone


Dear Gone,
The members of your in-laws’ pack sound rather like the three-headed Fluffy, Hagrid’s vicious hellhound from Harry Potter. An enchanted harp put all three of Fluffy’s heads to sleep, so you might want to start learning how to make celestial music as Christmas draws closer. You have two children and two cats, and when the holidays are over, you’re within your rights to expect you end up with the same number you started with, all 16 limbs included. Avoiding free-range encounters with these poorly disciplined dogs is a smart move. But it’s one thing to stop them at your own door, and another to say they can’t even be incarcerated in the car while the rest of you eat. Sure, it’s crazy that these wealthy people can’t manage to find dog sitters, but from your description they are a parody of spoiled obliviousness. (I acknowledge that relatives who are not among the 1 percent are also known to make obnoxious demands about their pets, especially over the holidays.) If they want their luxury car shredded, it really doesn’t make any difference to your festivities if the dogs are held hostage in it. The holidays are a rare time of connection for your husband and your kids with these relatives. So I agree with your husband that you should have a heavy hand with the brandy when spiking the eggnog. But don’t have so much that you get tipsy enough to invite the dogs in for some scraps.

Global Voices Advocacy’s Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world. This week’s report begins in Iran, where on Nov. 24 the Supreme Court upheld a ruling sentencing Facebook user Soheil Arabi to death by hanging. Arabi was tried over a series of posts on his Facebook page deemed insulting to the Prophet Muhammad.

The 30-year-old was arrested in November 2013, along with his wife. While she was soon released, Arabi has been kept behind bars, where he has endured numerous interrogations, psychological pressure, and long periods of solitary confinement. According to his wife, he was allowed access to a lawyer only immediately prior to his trial. Prosecutors rejected Arabi’s claims that many of the posts in question were written by his contacts and merely appeared on his wall because he had commented on them. Leading international human rights organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are urging authorities not to execute Arabi and to re-evaluate the laws under which he was sentenced.



Despite media reports suggesting a new, more moderate approach to governance in the country under President Hassan Rouhani, this and other recent events indicate that security and intelligence agents in Iran are taking increasingly repressive measures against dissent and political expression online.

Slate,L,Drinking problem in academia: Alcohol abuse among faculty members.,"This week the Chronicle of Higher Education is running a series of long-form investigations about drinking culture on American campuses. I’m as concerned about the overdoses, assaults, and general idiocy of liquored-up undergrads as anyone—perhaps even more so, given the time one of my old Ohio State students, a 90-pound junior, proudly declared her intention to down 21 shots on the upcoming birthday that made it legal to do so. When I mentioned that this could result in her actual death, she just rolled her eyes like I was a neurotic off-duty German shepherd police dog: Oh, isn’t that cute; the Old thinks it’s people and it knows something.

Slate,L,Single-sex classroom research: Fake brain science supports gender segregation.,"Sometimes it’s hard to believe we’re living in the 21st century. Thanks to a tide of distorted “brain-based” education, some 750 public schools around the United States have been segregating boys and girls into single-sex classrooms that sound like the old woodshop and home economics classes of the 1950s.

Consider Middleton, Idaho, where elementary teachers electronically amplify their voices in all-boys’ classrooms but not in girls’ classrooms, based on absurd extrapolations about male-female hearing differences. Middleton teachers also reportedly encourage boys to run and play before exams, whereas girls are led in “calming yoga exercises” based on fabricated differences in their brains’ stress response systems.


Gender segregation has been allowed to flourish for nearly a decade in U.S. public schools. The good news is that the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has finally taken notice, and this week it issued guidelines to prevent schools from using biological differences as a basis for teaching boys and girls differently. The department’s guidance may be the first step toward battling back the gender distortions that have flooded K-12 education for years now.

For instance, the “busy boys and little ladies” title comes from teacher training materials in Florida, a hotbed for single-sex classrooms and whose teachers are mandated by law to receive professional development in gender and education. This doesn’t sound like a bad idea, until you learn that school districts are basing their training on the gender musings of Michael Gurian, a pop psychologist who lacks any training in neuroscience or education. In the Hillsborough district that includes Tampa, nearly $100,000 of taxpayer money has gone to the “Gurian Institute” and other trainers, who advocate blatantly stereotypical practices salted with just enough distorted claims about the brain and hormones to fool teachers into thinking they are scientifically based.



If separate and unequal classrooms sound illegal, it’s because they probably are.



Here’s a typical brain-sex factoid touted by Gurian: “Boys come out of the womb with a formatting for non-verbal, spatial, kinesthetic activity on the right side of the brain. In the areas where girls’ brains come out ready to use words, boys’ brains come out ready to move around, kick and jump.”


It all sounds so sensible—right on target with most gender stereotypes and therefore perfect justification for educating boys and girls differently. Except that none of it is true! There is no differential “formatting” of boys’ and girls’ brains, and no difference in the brain areas men and women dedicate to verbal or spatial abilities. Nor does testosterone—the favorite go-to hormone for Gurian and other gender segregationists—ramp up boys’ math skills or suppress their language development, as teachers in Florida have also heard in their training.


It’s bad enough to see teachers amplifying gender stereotypes, but it’s truly distressing to hear students themselves parrot false beliefs about boys’ and girls’ brains and abilities. In Tampa, a pair of single-sex middle schools, Ferrell and Franklin Academies, actually posts home page videos of girls boasting about their superior frontal lobes and ability to read facial expressions and boys expounding on their brains’ better visual and spatial processing. The implication of girls or boys articulating, respectively, “We’re good at emotion” or “We’re good at spatial processing” is the unspoken, but powerful corollary: “and we’re bad at thinking” or “we’re bad at talking.”


If separate and unequal classrooms sound illegal, it’s because they probably are. The Department of Education’s action was triggered by several complaints, including some filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged single-sex programs in Florida, Texas, and other states. The move is part of the group’s larger “Teach Kids, Not Stereotypes” campaign that urges stronger enforcement of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.


Title IX regulations expressly forbid single-sex education that is based on “overly broad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of either sex.” With its new guidance, the Department of Education appears to finally agree that these pseudoscientific claims about boys’ and girls’ hearing, vision, stress response, and cognitive abilities qualify as “overly broad.” The problem with such generalizations is that there are plenty of boys and girls who don’t conform to them—girls who are very physical or good at math, and boys who are very sensitive or good at reading—and are therefore being marginalized in such environments.


Of course, not all single-sex schools rely on brain sex differences for justification. But as Rebecca Bigler and I wrote earlier in Slate, the very fact of segregation of any type accentuates group differences. In children, especially, research finds that gender segregation exaggerates their beliefs in hardwired, immutable differences between the sexes. So while girls or boys may love their single-sex classes and even feel temporarily empowered in them, the loss of opportunity to work with members of the other sex ultimately fosters a distorted belief in gender difference that restricts all children’s potential.


Considerable research has now proven that single-sex education does not produce better academic outcomes than co-education. Which raises the question: Why have gender segregation at all in K-12 schools? We live in a diverse, pluralistic society, where schools need to better prepare boys and girls to work together, raise families together, and share leadership in the future. Most Americans now abhor racial segregation in schools, and by similar logic, gender segregation seems a poor way forward for today’s young people, especially when justified by pseudoscience.

Slate,L,Dear Prudence: I was fat-shamed by my cousin at Thanksgiving.,"Emily Yoffe, aka Dear Prudence, is online weekly to chat live with readers. An edited transcript of the chat is below. (Sign up here to get Dear Prudence delivered to your inbox each week. Read Prudie’s Slate columns here. Send questions to Prudence at prudence@slate.com.)

Emily Yoffe: Good afternoon. I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! Props to my 95-year-old mother-in-law for another great meal. Love that Thanksgiving sauerkraut! 


Q. Her Weight Problem, Not Mine: Over Thanksgiving, I volunteered to host my relatives. This included my cousin who used to be a plus-sized woman, had gastric bypass five years ago, and now believes in fat shaming. She targets me especially because of the fact I am a plus-sized woman too, but love my body. During Thanksgiving, she talked about my weight to anyone that would listen, even after I told her to stop it. I am ashamed to say that after she made a reference to my black swimsuit as a Shamu suit, my temper got the better of me, and I grabbed some mashed potatoes with my hands and started throwing them at her, screaming that she was a hateful, horrible person and then tossed her out of my house.

Now that the dust has settled, my family feels I owe HER an apology and an invitation to spend Christmas with me! Please help me get them off my back already!


A: Now I’m kind of sad that my family’s Thanksgiving was so civilized that no one got a bowl of sauerkraut and dumped it on anyone’s head. I can totally understand how instead of passing the potatoes you decided to toss the potatoes at her. Your cousin is a despicable person. What you have to do with such people when you’re forced to share space with them is walk away. I understand you were highly provoked, but you should have kept in mind that in her attempts to fat shame you, she was actually shaming herself. Unfortunately, you made it physical. So be the better person, and apologize for losing it. But as for Christmas, unless in response to you she gives you a full-bodied apology in which she explains she now sees how cruel and insulting she has been, I don’t see any reason for you to invite someone to your home who rejoices in making you miserable.

Q. Panty-Wearing Man: A widower for some five years, I enjoy wearing women’s lingerie: panties, camisoles, nighties, the occasional bra. I do not wear dresses, apply makeup, or try to “pass” in any way. I just enjoy the sensuality of the clothes. A widow and I have been sharing company and if I’m reading the signs correctly, are heading toward intimacy. My late wife was fine with my undies choice; how do I inform my friend that she might not be the only one shopping at Victoria’s Secret? We’re each in our early 60s. Thanks!


A: Before you get intimate, binge-watch with your friend the Amazon series, Transparent. It’s an exquisitely written and acted (and very funny) series about the coming out as transgender of a middle-aged father of three grown children. I know that’s not your situation. But there are many scenes that will absolutely hit home for you, and it will be a great way to open the discussion you want to have with your new lady. I advise people with kinks to disclose them early to new loves. It’s simply unfair months into a relationship to have an, “Oh, by the way, there’s something I should have told you …” discussion. It also sounds as if this isn’t an occasional thing for you, but an essential thing. You need to be prepared that this might be a shocking or difficult revelation for her, but what matters is what she then does with the information. And even if it turns out she’s not as open-minded as your late wife, I assure you, you’ll be glad you watched the series.


Q. My Son Calls My Husband “Daddy”: My 3-year-old has very little contact with his father, who lives 700 miles away. I recently married a wonderful man, whom I love dearly and who takes care of both me and my son. My son has recently taken to calling my husband “Daddy” every now and then. Should I try to discourage this or encourage it? My son’s father sees him about once a year, and calls about twice a year. My son usually calls him by his first name. My husband likes being called “Daddy” and, honestly, I like it, too. What do we do here?


A: Yay for Daddy! What a wonderful gift your marriage has turned out to be for your son. He now has a true father in his life, one who embraces this boy and wants to be his real father. Your son has already told you how he feels, and you all agree with it. So please, encourage him to call his stepfather “Daddy.” His biological father is a nonentity, so he can make his annual appearance, and your son can say, “Hey, Willy, how you doing?” I have had so many wonderful letters over the years from people who celebrate the stepparents who came into their lives and truly stepped up. How wonderful your husband is joining this crew.


Q. Vacationing Dad: My retired parents had scheduled a trip to Spain, but my mother became violently nauseated and feverish on the way to the airport. My father mistakenly believed that his trip insurance would only cover my mother, so he called my brother to pick her up and take her to the hospital, while he went on the trip alone. She was very sick and in the hospital for three days, but it turned out to be a non-life-threatening virus of some sort. I was furious with my father, but my mother is not, and my brothers feel that it was just Dad being Dad. Is this shockingly bad behavior, or is this sort of thing socially acceptable?


A: Umm, are you sure prior to the trip your father didn’t encourage some ailing toddler to give your mother a big wet one? I’m having a hard time imagining this scene at the airport where your brother carts away your desperately ill mother, while your father waves adios. Yes, this is shocking behavior, but you really don’t have standing to do anything about it. Since everyone writes this off as “Dad being Dad,” maybe your mother enjoyed the pampering she received during her hospital stay more than she would have enjoyed being in Spain with her oblivious spouse. Everyone has shrugged this off but you. But Dad’s home, Mom’s out of the hospital, and about the only suggestion you can make is that next time your parents take a trip that they both read the fine print on any travel insurance.




Q. Re: Panty-Wearing Man: The letter writer makes it very clear that he isn’t trans. The fact that you call it a kink shows that on some level you understand this. Equating a kink with being transgender is very offensive.


A: I explicitly said I understood that being trans was not the letter writer’s situation. Then I said that there would be scenes in the show that spoke specifically to the conversation he wants to have. If you think that being transgender is offensive, I don’t share your view.


Q. Boy in Pink: My 5-year-old son’s favorite color is pink and he wants to incorporate pink anywhere he can. On days he has dance class he often wears pink leggings and he likes to paint his nails pink. At school there are no issues, his classmates and teachers embrace it, but we’ve had some concerns with family and in public. To other kids and family when something is said he tells them that boy and girl things don’t exist and people can like whatever they want. How do I respond to family and his dad when they tell me I overindulge him by buying him pink shoes and painting his nails? Do I correct strangers in public that assume he’s a girl because he’s wearing pink leggings or let it go? I want my boy to know that he’s loved and supported no matter what.


A: I love your son! What an amazingly wise and confident little guy you have. How wonderful that you say his classmates and teachers are all onboard with the boy in pink. The world really is changing! Strangers are irrelevant. It sounds as if your son has a handle on the fact that some people incorrectly think people think pink is only for girls, and this doesn’t bother him. But what is concerning is how bothered your husband is. He is absolutely entitled to feel unease, but having recognized that, he has to examine these feelings and then figure out what’s best for your son. None of you know that this pink phase means. But what’s important is letting your son feel supported in his choices. This seems like a good issue for you and your husband to discuss on a short-term basis with a counselor. Your husband can air his concerns and figure out what to do about them, so that your boy feels both his parents have his back.


Q. Re: Daddy: My 5-year-old stepdaughter has a wonderful mother, with whom she lives during the school year. I came into her life when she was just turning 3, and by the end of our first week together, she started calling me “Mommy.” Now older, she calls me by my first name around her mom, but when in our home in our routine, she calls me Mommy. She once confided in me that her mom did not want her to call me Mommy. I told her that I didn’t want her to get in trouble with her mom, but that in our house, she could call me whatever she was most comfortable with. I always felt that I didn’t want her to think that I loved her less than my own children. If your husband is the only father figure he is close to, I think you should just let your son take the lead and go with it.


A: Beautiful, thank you.


Q. Re: Shamu Suit Cousin: I understand that at the point someone is throwing mashed potatoes, they’ve literally lost it. That being said, some people deserve a face full of mashed potatoes, and quite frankly, I don’t think your letter writer should have to apologize. In fact, I think she should evaluate why on earth she has people in her life who want her to invite her hateful cousin back into her home? Why isn’t she getting more familial support?


A: Good point about the rest of the family. What’s going on there? Maybe it’s time to spend Christmas with friends. As I said, I understand the face full of potatoes, but it’s better for the letter writer to acknowledge she shouldn’t have done it, no matter how awful the provocation. That allows her better to move forward and explain she is not going to allow such a toxic person in her home.


Q. Re: Boy in Pink: Dad may want to check out James Braly’s excellent story from The Moth called “Oliver’s Pink Bicycle”—it’s a wonderful story of a parent’s acceptance of his son’s obsession with pink.


A: Thanks!


Q. Am I Responsible for a Parent I Barely Remember?: When I was 3 years old, my funny, intelligent, handsome father developed paranoid schizophrenia, including very disturbing hallucinations that made him act erratically. My mother feared for her life and mine and divorced him and moved us halfway across the country—he wouldn’t stay on his meds and she felt she didn’t have a choice. He maintained contact with me as well as he could. After his parents passed away, we lost touch. I assumed that his brother and sister knew where he was and what his condition was. Now I find that they haven’t heard from him in 10 years. I’m an adult now with a family of my own, and I find myself increasingly worried and wondering about his wellbeing. Do I try to track him down? I know the mentally ill aren’t more likely to be dangerous than others, but I’m still worried that, even at 65, he may be off his meds and unpredictable. Is it fair to my kids to pursue this?


A: What a tragic story, and how broken our mental health system is. You can start by gathering some information about your father without contacting him. A private investigator should be able to put together a basic dossier on him. At this point, you don’t even know if he’s alive, so first establish that. If he is, then see if he’s employed, or has been arrested, etc. The information will allow you to make a better decision about whether you want to proceed and how.

Slate,L,"Marcel Leliënhof photographs the Hells Angels in Norway in his book, Helvetes Engler—Hells Angels MC Norway(PHOTOS).","The Hells Angels may have loomed large in 1960s American culture, but they’re alive and well in Norway.

There’s more than one stereotype shattered in Marcel Leliënhof’s book Helvetes Engler—Hells Angels MC Norway: Besides being Norwegian and existing in the 21st century, the motorcycle gangs Leliënhof photographed for five years had none of the law-breaking, violent tendencies of the group described in Hunter S. Thompson’s 1966 book Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga.


“The first Norwegian chapter of the Hells Angels started in 1992 and was probably as wild as their U.S. brothers then. But the club as it is now is not what I expected after reading Thompson,” Leliënhof said via email. “It is a tight-knit brotherhood of guys who have known each other for a long time and who have sacrificed much to become who they are.”

        });

Norway is a small country of about 5 million people, but it has nine chapters of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and more than 100 members total. But before Leliënhof could start his project, he needed approval from Hells Angels Europe and Hells Angels MC World, a process that took three years. Even after that, gaining the trust of individuals within the local organizations took time.


“I have stayed at all the clubhouses in Norway. This is the only way to make a project like this work. You have to earn people’s trust, and the only way to really understand others and to tell a truthful story is to get to know them over time,” he said.


As in the United States, biker gangs in Norway have a history of behavior that contributed to a criminal reputation: In 1997, for example, the Great Nordic Biker War reached the country when a car bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the Bandidos, the Angels’ rival club, killing a bystander. But the Hells Angels MC Norway Leliënhof traveled with “is not a club of boy scouts, nor it is a club with a bunch of rabid lunatics with guns in one hand and drugs in the other.”

        });
         

Leliënhof, a former self-described punk, has photographed other subcultures in the past, including skinheads and rockabillies. He said doing so has spurred his creativity, and satisfied his urge to explore the “darker side of life,” which is why he continues to travel and party with the Angels to this day.


“I feel that subcultures are important and bold creative forces in Western society—before they are consumed by commercial interests,” he said. “These groups of people are willing to live on the edge of society and are made up by individuals that challenge what the mainstream considers to be interesting or acceptable. As a result, they make for great stories to tell.”

Slate,L,M83: New composite shows incredible detail.,"M83 is a lovely spiral galaxy located about 15 million light-years from Earth.

I’ll have to fix that sometime. Of course, my view will never, ever be quite as nice as this one:

Holy. Wow.


That image is a combination from two different observatories; part Hubble, part Subaru (an 8-meter monster telescope in Hawaii). It was created by master astrophotographer Robert Gendler. The inner parts are from Hubble, and parts of the surrounding area (added to fill in blank spots) are from Subaru.


If you have a good eye you can tell; the resolution in the spiral arms is quite high, and you can see individual stars, but if you look at the two more distant background galaxies on the left, the details look a bit fuzzier. Subaru has good resolution, but it’s hard to beat Hubble.


I highly recommend checking out Gendler’s 3,500 x 2,800 pixel version of this, as well the vast 6,000 x 6,660 Hubble-only image; the detail in the spiral arms is jaw-dropping.

        });
         

M83 is pretty close as galaxies go and has been extensively studied. One of my favorite shots of it is from the Spitzer infrared observatory (inset here); that traces the dust in the galaxy that glows in the far-IR. Where you see glowing red filaments is where stars are being born, and massive stars are dying. Both processes create and illuminate the long carbon-based molecules—dust—strewn in the spiral arms of galaxies like M83.


I’ve written a lot about this galaxy, including the fact that it looks a bit off-center, and that it recently ate another, smaller galaxy. I’ve written about the dust in it, too.


I sometimes despair that there’s just too much stuff in the Universe to see. I mean, duh, obviously, that’s true. It’s the Universe. But even nearby there are just so many amazing objects, so much to know—thousands of galaxies surround us in our cosmic neighborhood, and each contains billions of stars, huge numbers of star-forming nebulae, clusters, black holes, exotic compact objects like neutron stars and magnetars … we can’t even map everything in our own galaxy, let alone those nearby.


But then I remember how incredible that very fact is. There is wonder and joy and amazement in every direction we look, for as far as our minds and technology allow us to see. Sure, it’s overwhelming. It’s the Universe.


I’m OK with that. Really, even more: I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Slate,L,Peter Pan played by a woman: Why? A history of casting the J.M. Barrie character.,"When the news that NBC would be airing Peter Pan Live! was first announced earlier this year, Aisha Harris sought out the reason for why the elfin boy who will ""never grow up"" is usually played by a woman. Tonight, the much-discussed special will premiere, starring Allison Williams as the titular character and Christopher Walken as Captain Hook, and we've republished the piece below.

Earlier this week, NBC announced plans to follow their hugely successful live version of The Sound of Music with a live adaptation of the musical version of Peter Pan. The choice seems like a no-brainer: Back in 1955, the network aired a live broadcast of the Broadway production starring Mary Martin to 65 million viewers, and that version has since become a beloved cultural institution through subsequent airings and home video.






    Advertisement




What is surprising is the suggested cast. NBC Entertainment’s chairman initially joked that he wants Miley Cyrus for the title role, then “hinted” that Peter Pan may be played by a male actor instead. This is a big deal to fans, since the character is nearly always played by a woman. Why have so few men stepped into the role of the eternally young boy?


Initially, the interests of a producer, the logistics of casting, and even English law may have played a part. After that, it became tradition. In his 1979 book, J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys: The Real Story Behind Peter Pan, English writer and director Andrew Birkin recounts the backstory for the first stage productions. Broadway producer Charles Frohman enthusiastically agreed to produce the play, and he made a couple of suggestions to the author. First, that it be titled, simply, Peter Pan; Barrie’s working title was The Great White Father, which is what Barrie has the Indians call Peter. (That phrase has uncertain origins but was—and is—used by some Native Americans to refer to white leaders.) Second, Frohman asked that, in America, the starring role of Peter be played by his protégé, Maude Adams. Frohman reasoned that a man would be wrong for the part, and if they cast a boy, the other children “would have to be scaled down in proportion.” English law prohibited the use of minors under 14 on stage after 9 p.m. So a woman it was.


Nina Boucicault, the sister of the show’s director Dion Boucicault, was tapped for the lead in England, and she originated the role in December of 1904. (Adams wasn’t available to work until the following summer, and so Frohman, “impatient to see the play produced,” set up the West End production with Boucicault first, in time for Christmas.)


As Birkin explained to me via email, actresses Cecilia Loftus and Pauline Chase were cast in the seasons following the initial London production, and “even the 1924 silent movie had a girl—Betty Bronson—playing Peter.” From there, casting a woman for stage adaptations became the norm, and the majority of prominent productions have seen a female in the title role.


Jerome Robbins’ musical version, a vehicle for Mary Martin, extended this tradition. Only one man, Jack Noseworthy, has played this version of Peter on Broadway, and he was an understudy in Jerome Robbins’ Broadway, an anthology of musical numbers from various shows (Charlotte d’Amboise was the principal Peter Pan). Only one song featured the impish boy character.


There have been a few recent exceptions. Since the 1980s, the Royal Shakespeare Company has frequently employed adult male actors in its production of the play, and is currently doing so with actor Sam Swann. The Broadway and off-Broadway productions of the “prequel” to Barrie’s story, Peter and the Starcatcher, featured male actors. And in nearly every film adaptation, Peter has been played (or voiced) by a male.

According to Birkin, Barrie always wished to see a boy play Peter on stage, though he never lived to see it occur. (In 1921, he tried to convince Charlie Chaplin to direct and star in a screen version. Chaplin considered it, but the film never came to fruition.) If NBC does wind up casting a male in the part, it will join those other exceptions as a fulfillment of the author’s wishes.


What youthful guy—aside from the supposedly retired Justin Bieber—would have the star power to pull in ratings the way Carrie Underwood did for The Sound of Music? None come to mind. But Birkin doesn’t think age really matters. “It's the spirit that's important rather than the letter,” he says. “I always loved Tyrone Guthrie’s comment, that any actor playing Peter must be ‘as delicate as a moth, as deadly as a bomb.’ ”

Slate,L,Tension between Germany and other eurozone countries over stimulus is hurting the economy.,"This article originally appeared in Business Insider.

“Poor old Germany. Too big for Europe, too small for the world.”


    Advertisement




That’s what former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger famously once said about Germany. And the statement still holds some truth today. 


Right now, Germany’s politicians and the Bundesbank (the country’s portion of the European Central Bank) are the two major things holding back more financial stimulus in Europe, which could, if approved, revitalize the continent’s flagging economies. 


Germany has consistently opposed more monetary stimulus by objecting to interest rate cuts and quantitative easing (QE), a method that’s meant to push investors away from safe government bonds and into corporate bonds and stocks. German officials are also reliably opposed to less strict deficit targets, which could also boost the economy. 


This conservative strategy may work for Germany—which does not necessarily need quantitative easing (Germany’s growth is slow, but unemployment is at a record low)—but it does not bode well for more troubled economies like Spain, Italy, and Greece. 


The problem is, because all the eurozone countries are bound by a single currency, the euro, they all have to subscribe to the same policies. 


Unfortunately for Spain, Italy, Greece, and others, the European Central Bank is built on German foundations and operates in a similarly cautious manner. Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform explains:


The ECB was modelled on the German Bundesbank. As a result, it is one of the world’s most politically independent central banks; its mandate is focused narrowly on price stability; it does not take broader economic goals like unemployment into account in the way other central banks, such as the Fed, do; and it is de facto more restricted than other central banks, since controversial measures can lead to complex political and legal struggles, involving 18 (soon to be 19) countries. Its setup and philosophy are therefore ""German,"" that is, conservative and cautious.


In short: The tension between Germany and the eurozone leaders who want more stimulus, like Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, is partly what’s causing the the near-zero growth and inflation that the region is seeing today.


It’s hard not to feel bad for Germany, which didn’t even want the euro in the first place. Through most of the 1990s, before the euro was introduced, German opinion polls did not support the new currency. The euro was officially adopted in 1999, without the approval from European citizens through a referendum. Only Denmark and Sweden held votes. Both countries rejected it.


In the chart below, you can see that German support for the euro (gray line) remains below support from Europe as a whole (black line) between 1990 and 2011, with the exception of 2007.

            }
        });
         

There’s also some astonishing historical evidence that suggests then-West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was pushed by French President Francois Mitterrand into accepting the euro.


Today, German politicians are stuck in a vicious cycle. Since most German voters don’t favor stimulus measures, the more support these politicians offer to Europe-wide stimulus, the more voters they are likely to lose to the country’s anti-euro party, Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD). In turn, the more support the AfD gain, the more they are able to influence the debate over Europe in German politics, and the more other German politicians have to try to claw votes back from the AfD.

Ultimately, Germany is is trapped in a pretty grim position: It’s the only country capable of pulling Europe out of its current funk, but most Germans never asked for—and don’t seem to want—that responsibility.

Slate,L,Why female Jacana birds do all the fighting while the males stay home and watch the kids. ,"Excerpted from Animal Weapons: The Evolution of Battle by Douglas J. Emlen. Out now from Henry Holt and Company LLC.

Jacanas are bizarre birds, especially when it comes to their weapons. The female I’m watching has especially big spurs, one on each elbow, and she creeps about with delicate steps on very long legs. Her slender toes splay to a span of more than 5 inches per foot, and her gait brings to mind a carnival stilt walker. This female, “red-over-blue-and-white right” (named for the colored ring bands on her right leg), is making the rounds of her territory, checking the nests of each of her four mates. Her territory is difficult to get to, and we have to watch at a distance from a canoe. Jacanas defend areas of floating vegetation on wide tropical rivers. Panamanians call them “Jesus” birds because they look like they walk on the water and, in a sense, they do. They tiptoe across their floating mats, dispersing weight with each step over delicate toes, balancing atop the bobbing rosettes of water lettuce and hyacinth.


    Advertisement




This morning, red-over-blue-and-white right is fighting again, as she so often does. An unmarked female had darted in from the adjacent shoreline, hiding in the hyacinth leaves behind one of the males, but our territorial female spots her immediately and closes in. Now, face to face, the two birds size each other up. Crouching low, elbow spurs flared out to the sides, each sidesteps the other in a slow circle. Then red-over-blue-and-white right pounces, leaping into the air and striking the intruder feet first on her way down, slashing out with her spurs. Everything whirls into a blur as both birds leap at each other over and over, crashing together and jabbing as they flail onto the mat of floating lettuce, pop to their feet, and leap once more. And then suddenly the fight is over; the intruder flies away, and the thick air rings with raucous ka-ka-ka-kas as our focal female proclaims victory to birds nearby.


Hundreds of vagrant females forage along the nearby shores of the river. These individuals have failed to secure an island territory of their own, and they challenge the resident females incessantly, pressing and probing, searching for weakness. For vagrants these battles are “do or die,” since failure to secure a territory is an evolutionary full stop, a dead end. Unless they can find a way to displace one of the owners, their chances of breeding are nil.


Female jacanas are fighters, towering over the males. They are stronger than males, vastly more aggressive, and they have the larger weapons. Sharp yellow spurs jut forward like daggers from each elbow. Bigger females fare better in fierce battles, and as a rule only dominant, top condition females manage to hold a territory for long enough to breed.



Jacanas seem backward. Females are more aggressive than males, they are larger, they fight more viciously and frequently, and they have larger weapons.



Males also fight for territories on the floating mats, though their battles are less vicious and are independent of the wars waged by the females. Males fight with rival males, and successful individuals defend patches of floating greenery sufficient to raise a clutch of chicks. These territories pack into the floating islands like tiles of a mosaic, with the female territories superimposed on top. Some females may be able to shove rivals away from only a single male territory, but the biggest and best females own enough island to house three or four males.


My female is engaged in yet another fight—her fourth of the morning. The male shepherds his brand-new chicks as they wobble from plant to plant, all feeding on little insects squirming at the water surface around the lettuce.


The next male over, his territory also nestled within the holdings of red-over-blue-and-white right, still has eggs, and he sits on his hidden nest sheltering his clutch. A third male has nearly grown chicks, and the last male is between broods, ready to begin the process again. Our female, when she’s not battling to hold her spot, moves freely among her males, mating with them from time to time. When one of her males is ready, she’ll lay a clutch of four eggs into his nest. But then she will abandon the eggs to the male and move on, placing her next clutch a few weeks later into the nest of a different male. Male jacanas spend several months tending to young each time they reproduce, preparing nests, incubating eggs, and shepherding the chicks as they grow to independence. Females show up to provide eggs when needed, but otherwise they leave the tending of young to the males.


Jacanas seem backward. Females are more aggressive than males, they are larger than males, they fight more viciously and frequently than males, and they have larger weapons. In the animal kingdom, usually it’s the other way around. In flies, beetles, mastodons, crabs, and elks, males are armed, not females. Jacanas excepted, in every species with weapons confined to a single sex, males have those weapons. Why should just one sex have weapons? And why is it (almost) always the males?


Females of all animal species produce larger reproductive cells (called “gametes”) than males. Eggs are bigger than sperm, and this difference in material investment is far more substantial than most of us appreciate. Humans are rather ordinary in this respect, but we’re a good place to start. The female egg is the largest cell in the human body. It measures almost a fifth of a millimeter across—about the size of a period (.) on this page—and it’s just visible to the naked eye. Sperm are the smallest cells in the body, and 100,000 could fit into the volume of a single egg.


In many animals differences in egg and sperm size are much more profound. A zebra finch mom fits nicely in the palm of your hand. She’s roughly 4 inches beak to tail, but she lays an egg that is more than a ½ inch across. By weight, a finch egg is 7.5 percent of the weight of her body. That’s equivalent to a human female producing an egg weighing 11 pounds. Kiwis have the most gargantuan of all gametes, relative to their body size: brown kiwi moms lay eggs that are a fifth of their body weight. Our human mom would need to produce a 30-pound egg to compare—the size of an 18-inch watermelon.


Asymmetry in gamete size has consequences that ripple through the biology of animal species. For one thing, females can’t produce as many gametes as males do. With the same amount of resources, males produce trillions of sperm. And these numbers stack up fast, since each male produces similarly copious quantities of sperm. A human female produces roughly 400 viable eggs over the course of her lifetime. A male, on the other hand, cranks out 100 million sperm every day, easily 4 trillion over his lifetime. Scale that up to a population of 1,000 people, and there are a quadrillion (that’s 15 zeros) more sperm than there are eggs. Scale it to the current human population and there are a septillion (24 zeros) more sperm than eggs. And humans aren’t even an extreme example. The simple fact is that in virtually every animal species there are nowhere near enough eggs to go around. The result is competition.



 



        requirejs([""jquery""], function($) {
            if ($(window).width() < 640) {
                $("".slate_image figure"").width(""100%"");
            }
        });
         

The size of female gametes is important for another reason. Large, nutrient-rich eggs are expensive, and they take time to produce. Depending on the species, females may take days or even weeks to recover from producing one batch of eggs before they are ready to lay another. Males, on the other hand, tend to need only a few minutes. Thanks to their gametes, females generally take longer to “turn around” between breeding events than do males.


Females also stand to lose more than males if a breeding attempt fails. Although each sex invests nutrients, energy, and time in producing gametes, the amounts they invest are different. Females spend more than males each time they reproduce and, because of this, the cost of abandoning a brood is much steeper for females than it is for males. As a result, whenever additional offspring care is required, it’s generally the females who provide it.


Females invest in offspring in all sorts of interesting ways beyond simply producing eggs. Cockroach moms hold fertilized eggs inside their bodies until they are ready to hatch, feeding and protecting them in an insect equivalent of a mammalian pregnancy. Scorpions wear bundles of babies on their backs for weeks after they hatch. Dung beetle moms excavate tunnels into the ground and provision their babies with balls of buried dung; a few species even lock themselves inside a crypt for a year so they can guard the young as they grow.


Preparing nests, pregnancy, guarding eggs, and feeding and protecting young all take time. These forms of maternal care can increase the latency between reproductive events still further, compounding the rift in relative investment between the sexes. Males can invest in offspring, too, as they clearly do in jacanas and humans, but it’s surprisingly rare in the animal world. In most animal species, males provide little more than sperm, and this means they recycle an awful lot faster than females.


Turnaround times are tremendously important for explaining animal weapons because whenever they differ between males and females the result is always competition. If you walk into a population of just about any animal species, and you count how many individuals of each sex are physiologically capable of breeding right now, you’ll find that all the males are able and willing, but many of the reproductive-age females are not. Some of the females are physiologically unavailable—out of commission, so to speak—in between broods. Female zebras in the midst of pregnancy cannot conceive new foals. Cow elks cannot start new pregnancies while they are nursing existing young. Females that are locked into a current breeding event are “out of the pool” since they are not available for conceiving new young. If all of the males are able to breed, but only a fraction of the females are, then there will not be enough females to go around.




Enter nature’s most pervasive and potent form of competition, what Charles Darwin called “sexual selection.” Individuals of one sex compete for access to the other. In principle, sexual selection can work both ways, with either males or females competing. In reality, except for rare cases such as the jacana, it almost always involves males competing for access to females. Female jacanas still produce the larger gametes (eggs are bigger than sperm), and it takes them a few weeks to recover between clutches. But this is where female investment stops. Male jacanas spend up to three months tending to eggs and chicks, and as a result their turnaround time is longer than the females’. Females recycle roughly three times faster than males (24 days compared with 78 days), translating into almost three times as many reproductively ready females as males on floating territories. At any point in time, roughly half of the males in a population are tied down with existing eggs or chicks, leaving just a few of them free to start new broods while most of the females are yolked up and ready to go. They could lay eggs immediately if only they had access to a territory-holding, reproductively ready male. In jacanas, there simply are not enough receptive males to go around, and females battle it out for the chance to breed. Sexual selection, rather than selection from predators or prey, drove the evolution of blazing yellow spurs in jacana females.

Slate,L,Sian Davey: Looking for Alice is a series about a photographer’s relationship with her daughter who has Down syndrome (PHOTOS).,"Sian Davey, a mother of four, was pregnant with her youngest child when she was told that there was a good chance her daughter would be born with Down syndrome. While the decision to go through with the pregnancy was an easy one for Davey, it didn’t prepare her for what it would be like.

In addition to a fear that her daughter Alice would be treated unfairly in a society that she feels gives little or no value to people with Down syndrome, Davey had concerns about how her family would handle things and even her own expectations for Alice. “When you have children with Down syndrome, it becomes about them having Down syndrome,” she said. “They have a condition, it’s almost as if they don’t have a personality and she wasn’t Alice, she was Alice with Down syndrome.”

Davey explored various narratives about her relationship with her daughter, as well as her ideas of what her daughter might be experiencing, in the series “Looking for Alice,” shot on film with a medium-format camera. It is one of many projects in which she has immersed herself since deciding to follow a career as a photographer. (She is currently closing down her 15-year psychotherapy practice.)

“When we have a child who doesn’t have learning difficulties or Down syndrome, we all project on them that my child is going to be this or that, we immediately have expectations, but I wasn’t allowed any here, I was dealing with very different territory,” she said. “It’s a great exercise in looking at oneself and seeing what we do to our children and these expectations we have for them. As a psychotherapist I deal with the fallout of that all the time and it just illuminated and amplified my relationship with my other children.”


“What I found fascinating was once I got my thinking mind out of the way was the perception of photography as a medium of communication,” she said. “When the images came back it was extraordinary what was being shown to me and just by putting that intention out there, things were just showing themselves to me without me thinking.”


Davey said nearly all of the photos have been taken either inside their home or no more than a 10 minute drive away. Apart from watching the light, staying in the moment is her only parameter when shooting.


“I sit back and watch and I can kind of hear and see so I’m combining all my senses to what’s going on around me.”

Slate,L,Gangnam Style was so popular that YouTube had to upgrade its view counter.,"In November 2012, when “Gangnam Style” overtook Justin Beiber’s “Baby” as the most popular video on YouTube, Psy’s hit had about 800 million views. Looking back, that seems like chump change: The video now has 2.15 billion views.

In fact, that view number has gotten so astronomical that it broke the counter and Google had to build a new one. “We never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer (=2,147,483,647 views), but that was before we met PSY,” YouTube wrote in a post on its Google Plus page.

Google’s old counter could display integers up to 2^31 - 1 or 2,147,483,647. Which probably seemed like plenty whenever it was set up! It couldn’t reach 2^32-1 or 4,294,967,296 because one bit was being used to toggle between negative and positive numbers. But since you can’t have a negative view count anyway, the system was clearly due for an overhaul.


“Gangnam Style’s” views keep rising, and Google has even added an Easter egg to the video’s counter, if you hover over it. It’s a brave new world of 64-bit integer view counts.

Slate,L,"Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Were ancient Egyptians white, black, or brown?","British actor Christian Bale plays Moses in Ridley Scott’s new film Exodus: Gods and Kings, which opens next Friday. Aussie Joel Edgerton (Ramses II) and Idahoan Aaron Paul (Joshua) also star. In response to criticism of the mostly white cast, media mogul Rupert Murdoch tweeted: “Since when are Egyptians not white? All I know are.” What was the skin color of ancient Egyptians?

Not white. There is not yet enough evidence to make a definitive judgment about the pigmentation of the pharaohs or Moses, who himself was likely an Egyptian. Mummies are too desiccated to reveal skin tone, and the tiny amount of genetic evidence they have yielded so far adds nothing to the question. As the Explainer wrote back in 2011, small differences in bone structure don’t reliably indicate the race of a recently deceased person, let alone a 3,000-year-old corpse. We are mostly limited to the subjective statements of Egyptians and the outsiders who depicted them, which suggest that majority of people of pharaonic Egypt were neither white nor black, by modern standards.

Herodotus, for example, referred to the Egyptians as melanchroes. That term is sometimes translated as “black-skinned,” but Herodotus typically used a different word to describe people from further south in Africa, suggesting that “dark-skinned” is more appropriate. He also compared Egyptian skin to that of the people of Colchis, in the Southern Caucasus. The Egyptians typically painted representations of themselves with light brown skin, somewhere between the fair-skinned people of the Levant and the darker Nubian people to the south. These paintings, however, may not be entirely reliable, because Egyptian artists didn’t always faithfully attempt to recreate reality. They sometimes alternated skin tones of people in a row to create contrast. Men were depicted with darker skin than women to represent gender roles—men worked in the fields while women stayed in the home—even when the subjects were royalty who did not engage in manual labor.

Ancient Egypt was a racially diverse place, because the Nile River drew people from all over the region. Egyptian writings do not suggest that the people of that era had a preoccupation with skin color. Those who obeyed the king, spoke the language, and worshipped the proper gods were considered Egyptian. Outsiders were allowed to marry Egyptians. Even the aristocracy was racially integrated. Princesses from the Levant joined the Egyptian nobility. Maiherpri, a dark-skinned Nubian who lived shortly before the reign of Ramses II, was also part of the Egyptian royal court and was buried in the Valley of the Kings.


The skin color of ancient Egyptians is a long-running modern debate, both among scholars and in the lay community, even if the ancient Egyptians themselves didn’t much care about it. The last major flare-up came in 2005, when National Geographic launched a traveling exhibition featuring a reconstruction of the face of the boy-king Tutankhamun. A pair of earlier representations had suggested darker skin, and the lighter National Geographic version annoyed some observers. The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia convened a conference at which scholars slammed the depiction as too white. (One participant even compared the bust to a young Barbra Streisand.)* Nearly a decade later, though, the light-brown depiction of King Tut remains as good a guess as any.

Slate,L,Are trolls ruining Slate’s comment section?,"This article is part of a package of coverage about commenting on Slate. Make sure to also check out ""You Will Not Comment on This Article.” And then join other members and Slate staffers in an open thread discussion, “How Should Slate Improve Its Comments Section?” 

Some Slate writers believe it’s time for the magazine to stop hosting comment sections below every article. Among other things, they argue that the magazine isn’t investing sufficient resources into moderation and that stories about certain topics, such as feminism and race, are often overwhelmed by off-topic vitriol and hate.


We invited four Slate-sters to talk about the state of commenting on the site. In what follows, we’ve excerpted highlights from a recent exchange between senior technology writer Will Oremus, senior editor Rachael Larimore, senior writer Amanda Hess, and DoubleX contributor Amanda Marcotte. 


* * *


Amanda Marcotte: So is this the official beginning of the fierce fight to the death over comments?


Will Oremus: Nicely framed. Hyperbole and death threats—I feel like I'm in an Internet comment section already!


Amanda Hess: I'd like to begin by highlighting an insightful comment I received from a reader after publishing a long reported story about the publisher of a new website for women. It reads: “LOL! Why is Amanda Hess on her knees busy spit-shining Bryan Goldberg’s business? That is the question.”


Oremus: Worst Hamlet allusion ever.



If we're putting ideas out there, I think we have a duty to listen to our readers' responses.
Rachael Larimore



Rachael Larimore: That's a terrible comment, and the kind of thing that should be stricken immediately. Having said that, though, the media and publishing industry owes its existence to the freedom of speech and has a long and dedicated history of promoting the free exchange of ideas.


Hess: Unless we hire Barack Obama as our comment moderator, I'm not sure we're responsible for denying anyone his or her constitutional rights here.


And while the editorial page of a local newspaper was once the only way citizens could respond to the press beyond a soap box in the square, the openness of the Internet means that everyone who comes to Slate to file a comment has access to dozens of platforms where he can say whatever he wants about our work, his thoughts on women, or his breakfast. Let him do that on a server that Slate isn’t paying for.


Marcotte: I am personally a huge fan of free speech, which is why I think comment sections should be closed. The problem with them is that they become so overwhelmed by bigots, misogynists, and people who just want to say mean things for the hell of it that all good-faith actors just leave and go elsewhere. I don't know that the best way to protect free speech is to make it impossible for people who actually have something to say to get a word in edgewise.


Larimore: If we're putting ideas out there, I think we have a duty to listen to our readers' responses. If anything, because Slate is a site that features more commentary and analysis and opinion than straight, reported news, we have more of an obligation to hear what people have to say. One hallmark of a quality publication is that it is willing to run responses from readers that point out errors or disagree with its stances.




A Slate Plus Special Feature:

You Will Not Comment on This Article

A primer on commenting on Slate.




Oremus: I worked for four years at a publication with no comment section to speak of. You might suspect that this would be a blissful experience: The soapbox is all mine, and no one can say otherwise. But I never felt this way. I felt more like Gizmodo’s Matt Novak, who quipped that writing for a site that didn’t allow comments was like “whispering to myself in the wilderness.” Did my points land? Did I change anyone’s mind? Did a bunch of readers misconstrue my meaning? These are questions that go through my head when I look at a story I’ve published.


I want my stories to start a conversation, and I want my readers to feel like they have a voice in that conversation. That’s why I think it’s worth the effort to improve Internet comments rather than do away with them altogether. To me, even a messy, ugly comments section is preferable to silence.


Larimore: Our readers are already out there commenting on Facebook and Twitter (and maybe Ello, whatever that is). If we keep them in-house, that enables us to have a more meaningful conversation.

Oremus: It is true that people are free to comment on Slate stories on platforms other than Slate. But this is not an argument for depriving them of the opportunity to comment on Slate stories on the site itself. Twitter and Facebook have their merits, but they're very poor venues for substantive, ongoing, multiperson discussions that are tied to a single, specific article or set of ideas. The ideal venue for that specific sort of conversation remains the comment section of the article itself.


That is not to say that the state of Internet comment sections, or the Slate comment section, is ideal. Far from it. I agree that moderation is essential and also quite difficult, and is rarely done well.


Marcotte: I love the idea of “substantive, ongoing, multiperson discussions that are tied to a single, specific article or set of ideas,” but that is simply not my experience.


Larimore: I think that there is a difference between “hosting comments” and “making a writer beholden to reading/responding to them.” As writers, compared with the commenters, we have the larger and more visible platform. We have the advantage. It's easy to get caught up in the vitriol, but we can also choose to ignore it and remember that far fewer people will ever read the craptastic comments than will see our pieces.


Marcotte: Certainly, we can all ignore the comments. In fact, most writers I talk to agree that you should ignore the comments. But that says a lot about the value of comments. I'm reminded of the rule for cleaning out your closet: If you haven't worn it in a year, throw it out. Same with comments: If you generally regret reading them and just wish you hadn't wasted your precious time, it's time for them to go.


Hess: I've been enjoying our Slate Plus comment sections, where only those with a mutual investment in the site are granted access and where moderators are not just weeding out useless or vile commentary but actually spending a lot of time conversing with commenters, responding to complaints, and setting the tone. It's a worthy goal. I'm just not sure it's worth the investment across the site, given how much content we're producing now. Right now, we're totally half-assing moderation. And I'd vote to put those resources toward paying writers to do great work as opposed to having them hang out in the comment section.




A Slate Plus Special Feature:

How Should Slate Improve Its Comments Section?

A members-only open thread.




Marcotte: Oof, just checking the comment thread under my latest post and the first comment, up top, was a man who used my boyfriend's last name. It's a typical genre of comment I get, the “diagnosis” of me as a broken, sad person because that's what the commenter wishes were true. But by mentioning my boyfriend by name, the actual message of the comment is that I am being watched, carefully and obsessively, by someone with a rather unhealthy obsession.


Oremus: That is creepy.


Marcotte: I envy writers who feel that their comment sections give any insight whatsoever into how people are genuinely reacting to your arguments. But when it comes to writing that touches on class, race, or gender issues, a cesspool is a near certainty, unless you have rigorous moderation.


Obviously, one problem here is that different comment sections, even within Slate, have different values.  


Oremus: I do think it's true that Internet commenters tend to be overwhelmingly white and male, and that they tend to view comment boards as a safe space to vent all the sexist and racist thoughts that they'd never share in public. And I think stories by and about women and/or people of color come in for disproportionate amounts of abuse.


Hess: I'm curious: Are these the same people? As in, are the commenters who drop into DoubleX to take their dicks out the same ones filing rational and challenging arguments about technology under Will's posts?


Oremus: I've probably overstated the quality of comments I typically get on my stories. Plenty of them are lazy, asinine, or vicious in one way or another. It's just that a) the proportion of personal attacks is much lower on stories about topics that people don't take as personally as, say, gender or race, and b) I've grown accustomed over the years to scanning quickly past the idiotic comments to find those that contribute something of value.


Marcotte: I think comment sections often devolve to their lowest common denominators. Here's a great piece in the Washington Post that explains one reason why: Whoever is the biggest jerk in the comment section will always “win” the comment section, probably for the same reason that someone who throws up in a subway car invariably empties it out. For some blogs, this isn't really a problem because their lowest common denominator is probably not that bad. Like, with a tech blog, it's probably just going to be the people who compete to see who can be most cynical about the newest gee-gaw on the market—annoying but not hurtful. Feminism, however, attracts a crowd of men who are deeply threatened by the gains that women are making.



The biggest jerk in the comment section will always “win” for the same reason that someone who throws up in a subway car invariably empties it out.
Amanda Marcotte



Larimore: I don’t think that the experience you’ve had, Amanda, is exclusive to women writing about feminism, and I worry that keeping it narrow makes the solution seem too simple. I’ve received plenty of venom—from men and women—whenever I’ve written about being pro-life. William Saletan is one of our least predictable writers, and whenever he takes a position that much of our audience would consider contrarian—even if he’s just playing devil’s advocate—there are personal insults mixed in with all the intracommenter debating that’s going on. No one here thinks that comment sections function as well in practice as they do in theory. People are wedded to their own ideas, they don’t like to have them questioned, and many times they can be humorless. Does that mean we burn the house down? Call me stubborn, but I don’t like the idea of letting the jerks win.


Oremus: I was really disappointed with Popular Science's decision to shut off comments. I explained why here.


Hess: I don't have time to sufficiently respond to this right now, so I'll just drop in to ask: If you like comments so much, Will, why don't you marry them?


Larimore: Wait wait wait! Is Amanda Hess trolling us?


Hess: It's kind of fun!


Larimore: I think we need to look very hard at the costs that come with giving into the screechy, hostile, angry people. I am opposed to just throwing up our hands and letting trolls win. We have many readers that provide thoughtful commentary, or point out problems, or really pour their hearts out. Cutting them off because there are thoughtless, attention-seeking commenters trying to gum up the works seems self-defeating.


If comments are largely productive and beneficial on most of our sections, then we shouldn't deny those readers who enjoy conversations because of the bad apples. And I worry about the message it sends if we shut down comments to just one section or department. There are incremental steps—blocking specific commenters, making people use real names—that don't lead to the baby getting thrown out with the bath water.


Hess: I agree that comments sections can be really wonderful with the right moderation—Ta-Nehisi Coates' comments section is oft cited as a rare jewel, always civil yet challenging—but that takes a lot of time and work.


Oremus: Moderation is onerous, and that is a problem. Human moderation is expensive and slow. No matter their size, most sites can't afford it: Small sites are too poor to pay human moderators, and large sites have too great a volume of comments for human moderators to keep up with. The result is that moderation across the Web tends to be insufficient at best and nonexistent at worst.



Right now, we're totally half-assing moderation.
Amanda Hess
Illustration by Charlie Powell



Another way to improve comment sections is by employing some combination of human moderation and crowdsourced moderation, wherein a comment section relies on its own members to flag or downvote offensive or unhelpful comments. Reddit is an example of a site that relies heavily on upvotes and downvotes, and while Reddit certainly has its share of ugliness, some of the better-moderated subreddits have comment sections that are among the most intelligent, entertaining, and useful on the Web.


Marcotte: I think requiring people to login with Facebook does help with the ugly comments on pieces about race or gender. A lot of people would not like future dates, for instance, to find out what they say anonymously to women on the Internet.


Oremus: That most online comment boards allow people to comment anonymously is another big problem. Anonymity has its merits, and I'm not against it in all cases. But it does make the task of moderation far more difficult. When you ban someone with an anonymous account, he can just start a new one. That makes it harder to make people accountable for anything they say.


Forcing users to log in through something like Facebook or Google Plus is annoying and problematic in some ways, but it does go a long way toward addressing the anonymity/accountability issue. And it's still less heavy-handed than dropping comments altogether.


Hess: I agree that anonymity is a problem. I've found that when people criticize my work on a forum that is more open than Slate's, like Twitter, there is a social imperative for a critic to say, “Amanda Hess is being much too easy on this source,” instead of “Why is Amanda Hess giving this source a BJ?” There are at least reasonable actors in those forums who shoot down sexist commentary and demand good-faith arguments. (And even with that it's still really sexist!) Slate has a few commenters like that, and bless them, but our half-assed approach to comment moderation has resulted in a population imbalance between the trolls and the more benign, helpful, interesting, and funny smart-alecks.


We’ve disabled commenting on this piece—the irony! It’s because we want you to join Slate staffers and Slate Plus members in an open thread discussion, ""How Should Slate Improve Its Comments Section?” We’ll publish the best comments in a transcript late next week.

I have received a wedding invitation that specifies “cocktail attire” for the ceremony and reception. My investigation shows that this can mean any number of things. I come from Oregon, where formal attire means choosing one’s best flannel and scraping the mud off one’s boots. My wife has any number of stunning dresses that would fit the bill, but I don’t even own a suit. Is this time to buy one? Please give me some tips for navigating the rocky shoals of proper cocktail attire.


Thank you for your question!

The concept of cocktail attire originated in the U.S. during Prohibition—natural timing, given the irony intrinsic to the noble experiment: There was significant personnel overlap between the movement in favor of women getting to vote and the movement against anybody getting to drink, and the abstemious suffragettes supporting the 18th and 19th amendments inadvertently chased their daughters into speakeasies and such. They created the Drinking Woman—“an ideal rooted in newfound concepts of individuality and a denial of Edwardian matronly functions,” as the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art puts it:


She emerged at private cocktail soirées and lounges, and the cocktail dress, as a short evening sheath with matching hat, shoes, and gloves, was designated to accompany her. The cocktail affair generally took place between six and eight p.m. Cocktail garb, by virtue of its flexibility and functionality, became the 1920s uniform for the progressive fashionable elite.


At cocktail hour in 2014, a lady can always pass muster by wearing a little black dress. The gentlemanly equivalent of the LBD is a jacket, a necktie, and a nice pair of trousers. If you can’t be moved to buy a suit for this occasion, wear that, and wear it in the spirit of a sophisticated adult at ease, not of a teen tugging on his collar at Model U.N., or of an insurance executive soberly departing his retirement party.


Herewith, a cryptanalysis of other enigmatic dress codes that I, and people I know, have encountered on invitations.


“Lounge suit.” This baffles some Americans living in England, Rhodes scholars and dopey brokers alike. A lounge suit is just a suit: In the 1800s, English men of the upper classes wore strict, sober frock coats for work (if they worked) and lounge suits to play. The original lounge suit was called so because, soft and slack, it was worn to loll about the country or to relax at home. The lounge suit “was certainly not acceptable at the bank or the firm, nor at church, nor at highly formal social events in the daytime, nor for anything at all in the evening,” Anne Hollander wrote in Sex and Suits. In the 1900s, classes below the upper classes—people who hadn’t had the chance to lounge—started wearing them out and about, for business and pleasure, and here we are.



On one level, every party in recorded history has been a Dress to Get Laid party, with the exception of some wakes and brises.



“Fancy dress.”  This is a Britishism meaning “costume party.” Some British residents of New York City insist on using this phrase on invitations, despite its ambiguity on these shores. Some of those people do it strictly to remind us exactly how British they are, as if we’re supposed to be impressed. (I say to them, “This is America, pal. Learn the language.”) If you’re ever in doubt about whether a party advertised as a “fancy-dress party” is a costume party or a formal occasion, then show up wearing a tuxedo, but with a fanciful accessory on hand, such as a feathered mask or a backup bowtie.


“Highland dress.” This is a Scottish thing: You don’t have to wear a kilt, but if you own one, it’s time to get your tartan-flaunting on. Some Scotsmen wear nothing under their kilts. Some Scotsmen prefer boxer briefs. No true Scotsman argues against the logic of the jockstrap as an ideal underthing.


“Grown and sexy.” This is a black thing, and Urban Dictionary’s lexicographical game is in this instance tight, so here’s a lightly edited excerpt of its leading definition: Don’t even think of showing up at my function in baggy jeans, Air Jordans, platinum chains, and an XXXL white T-shirt. If you’re not in tailored Armani or Versace, stay your ass home! Also, unless it’s neo-soul, rare groove, or old school, you won’t hear it here. Want radio hip-hop? Go to that white kids’ club in the suburbs.




“Dress to impress.” The implicit emphasis on ostentation identifies the hosts as probable douchebags. Consider avoiding this party.


“Dress to Get Laid.” Since back in the day when Bret and Lethem and Ms. Donna Tartt and their peers were enrolled at Bennington College, students have celebrated an infamous pagan ritual of this name. When preparing to attend the debauch, you should cogitate on the fact that, on one level, every party in the recorded history of social life has been a Dress to Get Laid party, with the exception of some wakes and brises. Wear a T-shirt and jeans. Or a kilt and a jockstrap.


“Festive holiday attire.” You may be tempted to wear something corny. Try not to succumb to temptation. DON’T wear a Santa hat unless you arrive at the party in a sleigh. DON’T even think about a candy cane in your breast pocket or a poinsettia on your lapel; these accessories would be, in their hokum, only slightly less offensive than a mistletoe belt buckle. DON we now no apparel more gay than a red-and-green cummerbund.


“[Fill-in-the-blank] chic.” Miami event planners are known to possess, among other vices, a habit of declaring “tropical chic” dress codes. Native-born Herald reporters and Eurotrash art collectors alike know how to interpret this: linen pants, no socks. A son of San Antonio, describing a gala where the guys wore “Western chic,” recalls the footfalls of a stampede of Luccheses: “It was very J.R. Ewing—a lot of jean-and-jacket combinations, bandannas, turquoise, bolo ties, real tuxedos, and Texas tuxedos.” Last month the society page of the Times-Picayune told New Orleans ladies what to make of “summer chic” and “saucy chic,” saying of the latter, “I foresee a lot of low-cut shirts. … Possibly leather, too. And if that's what the host is going for, so be it.” As you read this, invitations mandating “Yuletide chic” togs for would-be eggnog tipplers are sitting in mailboxes all across the country.


This columnist has mixed feelings about these developments. Of course, we always appreciate gentle reminders about trying climates and difficult terrain. (If a wedding is held on the sand at a beach resort, you want a heads-up, so that you know to wear boat shoes with your lightweight suit for the sake of gaining the traction you’ll need to evade hotel security at 3 a.m.) And, of course, we can’t quite disapprove of the bride and groom who—true story—explicitly discouraged seersucker on the invitation to their Cape Cod wedding. (They were fearful that their guests would fashion costumes from the fabric—a kind of drag show of preppy appropriation. They were trying to save guests from themselves.)


But the “____ chic” formula prompts wondering worries: Isn’t this rather controlling? Isn’t it somehow vain? Is the host trying to throw a party or supervise a photo shoot?


“Classy.” A colleague looks back on a New Year’s Eve party at a friend’s apartment: “The friend was an event planner who also does interior decorating, so when she wrote ‘classy,’ I think everyone kind of got the idea. She’s a Very Certain Type. (Loves wearing sequins on a Monday, weird vintage hats, etc.) For the most part the ladies wore little black dresses or nice vintage dresses with pumps. The dudes wore button-ups and jeans. Which, IDK? It didn’t seem like they tried that hard.”

“Business casual.” We all know the adage: To dress for success is to dress for the job you want, not the job you have. That is generally a good policy—but have you ever studied photos of media moguls pretending to relax at Herb Allen’s annual thing? Only a degenerate careerist would sacrifice his style to emulate the epic shlubbery of Sun Valley business casual. It’s awful—pro-shop ski vests over tropical shirts and Rupert Murdoch under a baseball cap and worse. The photos present evidence that some guys who wear business suits all the time simply have no idea what to do when unprotected by their constraints. Many of those zillionaires look unemployed, and unemployable.


“Smart casual.” The idea is to respect the spirit of business casual without looking stupid. Wear an OCBD, chinos, old-school canvas sneakers, and—it’s a shame to have to spell it out—a belt.


“Artsy casual.” You should wear a sack jacket, an untucked polo shirt, dark jeans, and freshly polished leather shoes, and if at all possible show up slightly stoned.


“Casual cocktail.” This is like a dog whistle telling women to wear flats, Tory Burch, probs. (h/t Shannon Elizabeth)


“Evening casual.” Hunh?


“California semi-casual.” No shirt no shoes no service, so bring along a shirt, but don’t fold it, bro: Roll it lengthwise to spare yourself some creases.

In other words, he’s funny. “Everything I do makes people laugh,” he says. “I used to shave every day so I wouldn’t have to deal with it, but then finally I gave in.” In the middle of 2012, Petre quit his job as a carpenter and welder for Cirque du Soleil, and set out for the Vegas Strip in a pair of aviator shades and a T-shirt. He spent the next 18 months working full-time as a Zach Galifianakis impersonator, earning as much as $150 per hour and getting flown around the country for weddings and conventions. “I’m not a hustler,” he says. “I didn’t really have to try. People wanted to laugh because of the beard, and all I had to do was finish the punch line.”

Slate,L,How Yahoo could make up for its decision to sell Flickr users' photos.,"Every day, millions of people post their thoughts and pictures on Facebook and its Instagram subsidiary. Millions more post on Twitter, and Pinterest, and upload videos on YouTube—all participating in a modern ritual that enriches these third-party platforms while providing, in most cases, a satisfying experience to the uploaders. Apart from a few superstars who have special arrangements with these services, the contributors don't get a cut.

But when Flickr, the photo sharing service owned by Yahoo, decided to start selling pictures its users had uploaded—photos licensed by their creators for royalty-free commercial reuse—there was a sense that Yahoo had crossed some kind of line.

It's a somewhat complicated situation, but it highlights a longstanding unease in this arena. Are we getting a fair trade for what we so willingly give to these giant companies? Most people would say yes, but the digital world includes an evolving marketplace that has a long way to go before it reaches equilibrium.


The Flickr case looks from here like mostly good intentions run awry. Flickr has picked images from its vast photo library and plans to monetize them by reselling “custom wall art”—excellent prints mounted on premium paper or canvas. Some photographers, selected by Flickr, will share revenues. So far, so good.


What's not so good: Many Flickr users who uploaded using a “Creative Commons” license—a copyright method that reserves only some rights, not all rights—won't get a dime when their pictures are sold. Yahoo is reselling photos the users uploaded under a license often abbreviated as CC-BY (here's a link to the latest version), which permits reuse as long as credit is given to the original artist. Yahoo has every legal right to do this. Still, it clearly rankles some people, though when the Wall Street Journal contacted 14 Flickr users whose work was included in the new offering, eight said it was fine with them.


There are a couple of remedies for people who don't like Flickr's initiative. One is to remove pictures from the archive, and refrain from posting more. Another, for future uploads, is what I do when I post pictures at Flickr. I use a more restrictive Creative Commons license: CC-BY-NC. This means I'm freely licensing the picture for reuse by anyone, but only for noncommercial purposes. (I do the same with my books and my personal blogging.) So my photos aren't in Flickr's for-sale section, not that they're interesting enough that anyone would want a large print in any event.


Yahoo is being ham-handed here, no question. On a mail list I frequent, Nathan Matias, an MIT Ph.D. student, made one suggestion for how Yahoo could soften the indignation: “invite all purchasers of photographs to send a note of acknowledgment or appreciation to the photographer”—a thank-you note for the generosity demonstrated by donating the work to the public. Gratitude is a key element in the sharing/volunteer economy, as he also notes in a blog post.


I'd go further and say Yahoo should voluntarily share the wealth across the board, unless the photographer declined. Yes, this would add administrative costs. But imagine the goodwill it would generate.


Also imagine the goodwill the Huffington Post would have generated if it had shared just a couple of million dollars from the more than $300 million AOL paid for the site in 2011 with bloggers who'd posted for free and whose work had given the publication its early credibility. There was no legal obligation whatever to do this—the bloggers were told clearly that they weren't getting paid—but even a relatively small financial nod in their direction would have been seen as a highly ethical move.


Likewise, the people behind the Oculus Rift virtual-reality goggles, who sold the company to Facebook for $2 billion after members of the public crowdfunded the early development, might have offered something more than their hollow thanks to the people who donated via Kickstarter. Equity would have been impractical, and no one who contributes to a project via Kickstarter and other crowdfunding services should be confused about what they're doing. But it's hard to blame folks for feeling like they'd been used.


It's reasonable to have contempt for business models that run along these lines: You do the work, we'll collect the money, and thank you very much. It's unreasonable to expect every service to pay every user. But the Flickr mess is an invitation to rethink a lot of things in this digital age, including copyright and sharing and fundamental fairness.


Someday, I hope to see a social service emerge that either is entirely decentralized—where the users quite literally own everything—or limits its financial investors' returns on the principle that the users are also investors, of time and effort. Given modern norms and laws, I won't hold my breath on that one.

Slate,L,Chris Hemsworth is the Sexiest Man Alive 2014: A look back at People’s most enduring brand. ,"The Sexiest Man Alive was born in Rockefeller Center, on the 29th floor of the Time-Life Building, inside the offices of one of the most popular magazines in America. This was the mid-’80s, and People had been oiling its Hollywood-human interest machine for a decade. Focus groups of supermarket shoppers would inform the magazine of their current obsessions, editors then beamed that intel to the magazine’s international bureaus, far-flung stringers were dispatched into the field, and eventually, a file would appear back in People’s offices containing semi-digested reporting on that week’s hot topics. Michelle Green, a young People writer at the time, was tasked with scouring the files for the good bits, marking them with a grease pencil, and cooking them into stories aimed at sweetening up the checkout line: the 30-year-old cardiologist beau who mended a “heartsick” Mary Tyler Moore, the congressman’s mistress bludgeoned to death in bed.

Slate,L,Sheldon Adelson may have spent too much fighting Internet gambling: The Las Vegas billionaire shouldn’t have made himself part of the story.,"Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and his wife, Miriam, contributed almost $100 million to Republican candidates and related organizations in 2012, and another $5 million in 2014. Not surprisingly, the billionaire wants something in return. That something is legislation to outlaw online gambling. But Adelson may have overplayed his hand by putting too much into the pot—and in the process providing a cautionary lesson in why spending so many millions may actually be counterproductive,

It all began in 2011. Up until December of that year, the Justice Department treated Internet betting as illegal—a violation of the Wire Act of 1961. But in late 2011, the Justice Department changed its position. It decided that only online sports betting was illegal; other types of betting like online poker—where most of the online gambling action is—were no longer prohibited. That was obviously bad news for brick-and-mortar casino owners like Adelson who have no online presence. If poker players could ante up in their pajamas, why travel to Las Vegas?



If you spend $100 million and you can’t get your bill passed, what gives?



Earlier this year, the odds on Adelson’s online gambling ban looked good. In March, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Jason Chaffetz introduced the Restoration of America’s Wire Act, a bill to make online gambling illegal, and did so with solid bipartisan support, including Democrats Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii as co-sponsors. House Speaker John Boehner appears to have been on board, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was on board, too. (Reid always had a detente with Adelson, given their mutual interest in the Nevada travel and tourism business.) But the bill lingered. Then, a House hearing was scheduled for December. The idea, it seems, was to get it passed quietly.


    Advertisement




Then, last month, former Rep. Ron Paul spoke out, calling the bill payback to Adelson and therefore the worst form of “cronyism.” Amid dissension among the Republican ranks, the hearing was postponed. The quiet politics of doing Adelson a favor had become noisy. And the noisy politics of doing Adelson a favor are bad for those who would do the favor. Now there was no way to push the bill forward without it looking like the worst type of corruption. If I were a betting man, I’d put good money down that Adelson will not get his Internet gaming ban in this Congress.


If Adelson loses, should we then conclude that money doesn’t buy results? After all, if you spend $100 million and you can’t get your bill passed, what gives? As with all other ways we spend money, there are ways to spend money intelligently in politics and ways to spend it dumbly. So, what did Adelson do wrong?


Adelson’s biggest mistake is that he spent too much money. Spending $100 million in such public fashion is a great idea if you want to obtain a certain type of celebrity. It also works well if you want presidential aspirants begging for your largesse. But it’s actually a bad idea if you want to get anything done because it makes you the story. And unless you are a sympathetic character (which Adelson is most definitely not), it is not good to be the story.


Good politics might be described as the art of cloaking your special interest in the general interest.  But when you become the symbol of big money in politics, it is very hard to pull off this sleight of hand.


Adelson caught on to this axiom late in the game. In February, he told Politico, “When I started to imagine what would happen with legalized Internet gaming, it scared the heck out of me … because of what’s it’s going to do to our society. … I’m concerned about college students. They are of age, and I’m concerned about poor people who really can’t afford to do it, that we’re putting all these temptations smack on their kitchen table.” 




He’s doing his best to lend legitimacy and moral urgency to his cause. He’s set up the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, with former Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln, former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, and former New York Gov. George Pataki as co-chairs. He’s gotten Judicial Watch to investigate the Obama administration’s decision to change the interpretation of the Wire Act, alleging that the move “allowed companies—and big Democratic Party donors—with connections to Attorney General Eric Holder to amass huge profits.” The coalition has even taken to BuzzFeed with its highly shareable listicle: “10 Reasons Why Internet Gambling Is a Bad Bet.” Adelson even took a page from the old Jack Abramoff casino lobbying playbook, getting a laundry list of Christian family values groups to sign on to his anti–online gambling cause.  


But online gaming companies aren’t sitting still. After all, they have their entire business at stake here. They’re fighting back—hard. They’ve activated the Poker Players Alliance, which channels the energy of those who love playing poker and don’t want to have their online poker cut off. They’ve aggressively lobbied on the issue and have a very active social media presence. And unlike Adelson, the online gaming industry does not have a visible mega-donor.


Specifically, the online gaming folks have built alliances among libertarians, including a special relationship with Grover Norquist. Norquist, along with leading conservative organizations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the American Conservative Union, has come out against the federal ban on Internet gambling. Right-wing think tanks like the Heartland Institute have taken to calling the bill “Crony Socialism.”


Of course, one could argue that had Adelson not given so generously, the bill to ban online gambling wouldn’t have gotten as far as it has, and instead nobody would be even discussing it. That may be true. But my guess is that if Adelson had given only a few hundred thousand to campaign organizations (still putting him among the ranks of the top donors) and instead put most of his $100 million into a message machine to call attention to the dangers of online gaming, he’d have been better off.


Adelson always faced longish odds. Defenders of the status quo (in this case the online gaming industry) always have a built-in advantage. Because Adelson needs a change in the existing policy, he needs to pass a bill. That is always hard to do, given the many veto points in the U.S. system of government, which is especially true in the current Congress. Adelson’s opponents only need to undermine the urgency for action, and creating doubt and dissent is a very good way to accomplish that.


Perhaps Adelson will still find a way to tuck his proposal into must-pass legislation, and we will read stories of how money directly buys policy. But if he gets what he wants, it will be because he built the necessary coalitions and alliances, neutralized the American Gaming Association on the issue, and then had his allies use congressional procedural legerdemain. He will have won, despite the fact that he spent his $100 million poorly.   


Whatever happens, the larger point is that politics is neither a vending machine nor an auction. Strategy matters, and changing the status quo is always hard, especially when its defenders have their livelihood at stake. In Washington, money helps a great deal, but it isn’t a simple transaction.

Slate,L,Hosni Mubarak freed in Egypt: It’s futile for revolutionaries to charge dictators.,"Last week an Egyptian court dismissed charges against former President Hosni Mubarak, who had been accused of stealing from the state treasury and ordering troops to fire on civilians during mass protests in 2011. The collapse of this trial was the latest failure of a global effort to “end the impunity” of government leaders who order subordinates to engage in human rights abuses. This effort is futile. It’s past time for commentators to understand that “the principle that no person is above the law, especially those at the top,” is a slogan, not a principle, one that can rarely be lived up to because it misdiagnoses the politics of revolution.

Mubarak was the authoritarian leader of Egypt for 30 years. He rigged elections, jailed political opponents, presided over a notoriously brutal security apparatus, censored the press, and banned political rallies. He was tremendously corrupt; he and his family accumulated $1 to $5 billion during his reign.



In all of history, hardly any overthrown leaders have been subject to a trial.



The Economist, from which I quoted above, eagerly anticipated Mubarak’s trial, proclaiming “the urgent need for the open and speedy dispensing of proper justice for all serious offences, Mr. Mubarak’s trial to the fore.” So did many other commentators, as did the revolutionaries themselves. No one seemed to realize how unusual such a trial would be. In all of history, hardly any overthrown leaders have been subject to a trial. If you exclude trials by foreign powers (the Nazi leaders at Nuremberg, the Japanese leaders at Tokyo, former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein), you have a short list, indeed. Charles I (1649), Louis XVI (1792), and a few others in the past few decades, whose trials have largely been charades, like that of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Most revolutionaries either slaughter their deposed enemies or chase them into exile. When an authoritarian regime makes a peaceful transition to democracy (as is usually the case), the former authoritarian leaders are immunized from prosecution as part of the deal.


    Advertisement




There is a reason for this. All dictators maintain power by drawing on the support of vast numbers of people, including the elites. All of those people are complicit in the dictatorship, and so if the dictator is to be tried, then they must be as well. Even if they are not charged immediately, the trial of dictator will implicate them and throw into doubt their security from further prosecution. A country can function only if the bulk of the population—including most of the former dictator’s supporters and the elites who populate the military, bureaucracy, and higher reaches of the economy—cooperates with the new regime. If the new regime can’t make peace with them and immunize them from prosecution, then the only alternative may be civil war or social disintegration.


Thus, the United States found itself unable to prosecute all the Nazis and ultimately used various subterfuges to reintegrate all but the worst into society. In Japan, the United States spared the emperor and numerous war criminals high and low. In most of the peaceful transitions (Spain, Greece, Portugal in the 1970s, Eastern Europe in the 1990s, South Africa), members of the old regime were left alone or subject to minor restrictions. In Iraq, the United States blew it by trying to destroy the entire Baathist establishment. Partly as a consequence, the country lies in ruins.


In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood—Mubarak’s only real political opposition—came to power in 2012 and was driven from office a year later after popular protests against President Mohamed Morsi spurred the military to stage a coup. Morsi wanted to prosecute Mubarak, but now it’s Morsi’s turn to be in the dock. While Morsi won an election, he was not able to keep the country together for longer than a year.


Morsi alarmed the Egyptian public, especially liberals, because he seemed intent on consolidating power and becoming an authoritarian himself, with the goal (unlike Mubarak) of imposing religious law, Iran-style. Indeed, Mubarak was friendlier to women’s rights and education, and religious tolerance, than Morsi was. And while Egyptians understandably wanted to get rid of Mubarak, by developing-world standards, Mubarak was not a terrible leader.


During Mubarak’s 30-year reign, the Egyptian economy grew at a moderate, healthy rate, thanks in part to reforms implemented in the 1990s. Real gross domestic product per capita (in current U.S. dollars) increased six-fold, from $509 to $2,972. According to data from the World Bank, literacy for adults increased during this period from about 44 percent (in 1986) to 72 percent. (For women, the increase was from 31 percent to 64 percent.) The mortality rate for children younger than 5 fell from 166.1 to 22.8 per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth increased from 58 years to 71 years. The number of women compared with the number of men enrolled in universities increased from 46 percent to 91 percent. The percentage of the population living at $2 per day fell from 28 percent (in 1991) to 15 percent (2008).


During this period, Mubarak faced significant challenges to security. From within, he faced terrorist groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic Jihad, which assassinated his predecessor, Anwar Sadat. Although Mubarak was heavily criticized for the violence he used against his political opponents, he kept his country together and contained Islamic extremism. Compared with Syria and Iraq, where ISIS roams about, beheading, crucifying, and enslaving its enemies, Egypt is a paradise. Under Mubarak, Egypt avoided the civil war that is raging in its neighbor Libya, and the mass killings that took place in another neighbor, Sudan.


Mubarak also conducted a moderate foreign policy. Until Sadat made peace with Israel in 1978, Egypt was at war repeatedly—and not just against Israel. Mubarak resisted pressure to repudiate the peace deal and has not gone to war with a foreign state, except as an ally of the United States against Saddam Hussein in 1990-1991. Instead, Mubarak acted as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians. In a neighborhood full of bloodthirsty dictators, Mubarak showed considerable restraint.


None of this excuses Mubarak’s corruption, but it helps to explain why the Egyptian revolution’s Thermidor came as quickly as it did. For all its problems, the Egyptian state functioned. Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood overreached by seeking a transformation of society that would have thrown it into permanent turmoil. A trial of Mubarak would have played into their hands. The military and elite in Egypt could not let that happen.

Slate,L,"Chicago minimum wage vote: $13 by 2019, including for domestic workers. ","On Tuesday, Chicago's city council voted to raise the city's minimum wage from $8.25 an hour to $13 an hour by 2019. The move is a boon to all low wage workers, but especially domestic workers, specifically nannies, because the council also closed a loophole that had previously exempted domestic workers from the law. Parents in Chicago can no longer equate their kid's regular nanny with a teenage babysitter who does a couple of hours on the weekend. Nannying is a real job and has to be paid like one in the city of Chicago now. 

""This groundbreaking vote means that Chicago’s household workers will finally gain the same protections that most other workers have had for decades,” Myrla Baldonado of the Latino Union of Chicago said in a statement. ""Domestic workers often go unrecognized, but the caring work that they do makes all other work possible.”

Of course, it's unknowable how many domestic workers will actually benefit from this change, since domestic labor is often a cash-only business that allows employers to dodge paying Social Security taxes. There's very little that can be done to force people to stop paying domestic workers off the books. However, one of the benefits of a minimum wage hike is it improves everyone's bargaining power. If a nanny is currently getting paid under the table but knows she can get more money on the books, her employer might consider giving her a raise to keep her. 


Closing this loophole is a start, but fixing the problem of chronically underpaid domestic workers will take more than this bill. Part of the reason so many underpay their nannies is that it's nearly impossible for many families to afford quality child care without cutting some corners. Instituting federally subsidized day care of the sort found in places like France could go a long way toward fixing that problem, both by giving families a reliable source of affordable day care and giving professional child care workers employment opportunities that come with better pay and benefits. But recognizing that domestic labor is real labor, and should be paid accordingly, is a good first step in the right direction.

The New Yorker,L,Reverend,"

 


After his mother died, Thomas started thinking about his father. All too frequently, while she was dying, there had been talk of her going to meet him in Paradise, returning to the arms of her husband of thirty-two years, who had died thirty-two years before she did. This would be bliss. Thomas did not believe in such things, of course, though it was hard not to try to imagine them, if only to savor the impossibility of the idea: the two insubstantial souls greeting each other in the ether, the airy embrace. She had been ninety at death, he sixty. There would be some adjustment for that, presumably, in Heaven. The madness of it confirmed one’s skepticism.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } But even assuming that she had gone to meet him, who was he? Who was he now? Who was he then? Who was my father? Thomas thought. And why was he asking himself these questions now? That wasn’t clear. They weren’t exactly urgent. On the other hand, they weren’t going away. He didn’t feel like doing research, putting his father’s name into Google or delving into archives. He could have looked at his father’s old sermon notes. Thomas’s sister had taken some papers when their mother’s house was sold, after the funeral. The notes would have told him something, reminded him of his father’s handwriting, of the way the man thought. But he didn’t want to do that. The thought of his father’s sermons aroused unpleasant emotions. It was difficult to put his finger on the reason. A sense of embarrassment and irritation. What he wanted, rather, was to assemble a picture of his father as he, Thomas, remembered him. Who was he for me? A son should be able to say what his father was for him. What part of my personality do I owe him? How does this man still simmer in my life? If he does. Occasionally, Thomas would tell himself that he regretted not having asked his mother more about his father while she was alive. That would surely have been the moment to undertake this reappraisal. Now all his mother’s memories of his father had died with her. He’d never be able to access them. Yet he didn’t actually regret not asking her. The truth was that for all this chatter about her going to meet him in the beyond, for all her occasional tears when Father was mentioned, Thomas’s mother had spoken very little of his father. Very little. Perhaps the only time his name could reliably be expected to come up was when Thomas and his mother argued over something, usually something of a religious or political nature. Thomas could be provocative, stubborn, and his mother never wanted to lose an argument about things that mattered. Then, between exasperation and amusement, she would say, “You’re just like your father, Thomas. He loved to play devil’s advocate, too!”  How was this possible? His father had been a clergyman. Thomas couldn’t remember the man expressing a single idea that went against orthodox Christianity. How could Mother remember him playing devil’s advocate? Presumably, in their own private relationship, Father had liked to get her riled, flustered, indignant. And this had been partly, though perhaps not altogether, in fun. “He loved to split hairs, just like you,” Thomas’s mother said, shaking her gray head. She did not say which hairs Father had split, and Thomas had not asked her to expand. Why hadn’t Thomas questioned her reticence during her lifetime? It was not that he suspected that there was some secret being hidden from him. It was more as though she’d wanted to keep the man to herself. Perhaps she had been afraid that speaking of Father to Thomas would diminish him. Because Father was so devout and Thomas such a doubter. Speaking about him might have given her son a chance to make some disparaging remark, or simply to show once again that he didn’t believe. To rock the boat. That was a favorite expression of Father’s: Don’t rock the boat! In any event, she had kept whatever there was between them in her heart, to the end. In her bedroom, there was a photo of Thomas’s father as a young man, and on the glass frame below his face she had placed a small square of white paper with a few lines of religious poetry: Death hides— But it cannot divide. Thou art but on Christ’s Other side. Thou with Christ And Christ with me And so together Still are we.  Thomas respected this carefully preserved bereavement. He didn’t investigate. He knew that when the cancer had gone to his father’s brain he had accused his mother of all kinds of unpleasant things and that this had upset her greatly. Never for one moment did Thomas imagine that there was any truth in those accusations. It was just that the cancer had gone to Dad’s head. And who does one accuse, when accusing, if not one’s wife of thirty years? Thomas knew plenty about that. It even occurred to him that he was thinking about his father now because, in separating from his own wife, he had undone, as it were, the last thing that his father had done as a clergyman, when he’d married them, Thomas and his wife, holding their ringed hands one above the other and declaring, “Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.” Recently, in preparation for the divorce, Thomas had had to dig out the marriage certificate with Father’s signature on it. It seemed odd to think that his father’s hand had pressed on that very paper. Thirty-two years ago. His handwriting was scratched and sharp, but not without a certain angular elegance. Thomas examined the certificate for a few minutes, looking at his own signature, his wife’s, his father’s, then put it in an envelope with the other papers, ready for his divorce. Whore. That was it. Just once his mother had talked about it. They had been speaking about her cancer, he remembered. She was lucky, she said, because hers hadn’t gone to her head. Like poor Dad’s. Then she burst into tears and told Thomas that, in his madness before he died, Father had said all kinds of awful things; he had called her a whore. Shocked, Thomas immediately reassured his mother that it had been the disease speaking. She knew that. In his right mind Dad would never have said such a thing. Later, Thomas realized that she had told him this in order to receive his reassurance before dying herself. Once reassured, she didn’t tell him anything else. Edward Sanders was born in Liverpool, on the longest day of the year, in 1920. He’d had two sisters, one definitely younger. Perhaps both had been younger. Thomas could have asked his own brother or sister about this—they were older than him, they might know—but he didn’t want his brother and sister to know that he was thinking about his father. Why not? He didn’t want to pool their collective memories. He didn’t want to have to adjust his views in the light of their knowledge. Vaguely he was aware that Mother had spoken of Father’s being fond of Doris, the youngest sister. But, so far as he could recall, Father had never spoken of her. He had never spoken of his mother, either. All Thomas remembered, from perhaps two visits when he was very small, was a tiny old woman with white wispy hair and a hooked nose. Was his father deliberately enigmatic? Edward Sanders had talked once of his father, Thomas’s grandfather. They were on holiday in South Devon, and Father had wanted to visit Plymouth Sound, because his father’s ship had been mothballed there during the Great Depression. Thomas’s grandfather had been a ship’s captain, and Father had spent an unemployed summer with him on that ship, waiting for world commerce to start moving again. It must have been a happy time for him, because he got quite excited as they walked along the shore, pointing out where the ship had been, the landing stage they’d rowed to when they went ashore. Thomas had the impression that his father had wanted to become a seaman, too, but had been held back by his poor eyesight. His eyesight was so poor that neither the Army nor the Navy had accepted him. He couldn’t even get a driver’s license. So while his own hero father had fought submarines in the Atlantic, he’d worked in Cammell Laird shipyard, doing technical drawings for marine engines. One of the happiest stories Father liked to tell was about how he was admired for his ability to hit rats with a paperweight in the shipyard workshops. It was strange to think that he couldn’t see well enough to join the Navy or drive a car but was perfectly capable of drawing engines and hitting rats with paperweights. Father had never spoken of his reasons for becoming a clergyman. But Thomas did know that his father and mother had initially planned to be missionaries. They had met at missionary training college. They had wanted an adventurous life. It was 1948; they’d just lived through a war, but only on the edge of the action. She had been bombed in London, he in Liverpool. Her father had forbidden her to join the Wrens. His father had been disappointed that his son couldn’t enlist. Now they would fight the good fight another way. Thomas’s parents’ marriage, he realized now, was based on a religious mission. They were partners in a task: to make the world a better place by converting people to the faith. That was the logic of their being together. If either of them lost this faith, their marriage would be lost with it. Wouldn’t it? Their life was a life in the Church, for the Church, though, for reasons that were never explained, they hadn’t in the end become missionaries. Perhaps having produced children made them less eligible. The Church didn’t want to be responsible for little white children in Uganda or Indonesia. Maybe we children blocked Father’s career, Thomas thought. We frustrated his ambitions. First the eyesight problem, then his children. He remembered the man’s impatience. His father had no time for chatter. Sometimes he barely took time to eat. He was impatient with Mother, too, impatient to be doing. But doing what? Winning souls for Christ. How strange. And how disappointing for him, then, to have failed first and foremost with two of the three souls under his nose, Thomas and his older brother. He took our salvation for granted, Thomas thought. Once he had decided to make the effort, it didn’t take Thomas long to gather these thoughts and type them on his computer. If only because there were so few. Thomas was living in a small flat now, away from his wife, whom he had left some time ago. Away from his children, who were grown up now. They no longer needed him for protection. Only for financial support. Yet he did not feel as though he had really got away. It was as if he had left home to climb a mountain and was now stuck on top of it, bivouacked above the tree line, free, but freezing, with no way forward. Thomas was perplexed. His wife was down in the warm pastures waiting for him. So it seemed. But he wouldn’t go back. “Permission to treat the witness like gum stuck to the bottom of my heel?”Buy the print » There were memories of infancy and memories of adolescence. There were two or three incidents that seemed important. Watershed moments. During Thomas’s early childhood, his father had seemed busy and happy. He preached and led meetings. First in Manchester, then in Blackpool. He was charismatic and embattled. He liked a fight. His voice was vibrant. He made jokes. He was a leader. People came to him for advice. At breakfast and lunch and dinner he said grace. In the evening, before bed, he said prayers. They were fervent, earnest prayers, the prayers of someone going to Heaven, or to Hell. He wasn’t interested in empty, formal religion. He liked his lamb and his roast beef, his plum pie and his custard. But he was always impatient to be up and doing again. Thomas distinctly remembered his father thrusting his chair back and wiping gravy from his mouth with a white napkin. People said “serviette” then. His father had had a rather slack mouth, poor teeth, but he was always clean-shaven. He was always ready to be meeting people. To be saving their souls. Thomas could actually see the gravy stain on the crumpled napkin as his father hurried off. But he couldn’t see his father’s face. Thomas tried and tried, but he couldn’t quite see it. In the small apartment he lived in now, he kept no photos of the past. He had no family heirlooms. What had Father looked like? A thin handsome nose, definitely; sandy hair, but receding; gray-green eyes, very thick spectacles. Father was endlessly cleaning his spectacles, usually with a huge white handkerchief. Thomas could see the vigorous action of the hands rubbing the lenses with the cloth. But he couldn’t put eyes and nose together. He couldn’t remember looking into those eyes, or them looking into his. The handkerchief was in the way. Father’s body was easier. Thomas remembered an aura of vulnerability, at once wiry and hunched, tense. But not intimidated. He didn’t keep fit, but rode a bike to visit parishioners. At the church, they hated him, because he had banned the annual crowning of the May Queen. It was paganism, he said; it had nothing to do with Our Lord Jesus Christ and his message of joy and salvation. He hadn’t become a clergyman to perpetuate pagan rituals and crown pretty girls. Once, Father took Thomas to a holiday camp with some boys from a reform school. That was frightening. They were wild. They jumped off swings in motion to see who could leap the farthest. They yelled swearwords and made rude gestures. Some of them had been sent to the school for robbery or violence. Father didn’t seem to have any trouble talking to these boys or saving their souls. Perhaps he felt that it was missionary work. He felt fulfilled. If Thomas had sworn or made those gestures, Dad would have been furious. It was also scary when Father talked about death and burials. There was a story about a coffin that floated in the muddy water after a storm and another that had to be forced down into the grave, because it was too long. The corpse had been a giant. In the end, Dad and the sexton had had to stand on the coffin to get it underground and even then they buried it at a forty-five-degree angle. It seemed strange to Thomas that his father could laugh at death. It seemed strange when he changed from his ordinary clothes into his robes, the long black cassock and starched white surplice, when he raised his arms outward and upward at the end of the blessing, so that he was like an angel. “May the Lord bless you and keep you!” His voice rang around the brown stones of the church. “May the Lord cause his face to shine upon you!” Later, the same man would chase Thomas and his brother back to bed if they crept down the stairs to spy on guests. “Scalawags!” he yelled. Sometimes he got seriously angry with Thomas’s brother and spanked him. “I will have the last word,” he said. “I will thrash the stubbornness out of you.” It was frightening. But reassuring, too, in a way. Thomas had never been spanked, that he could recall. I was the good boy, he realized. Or the shrewd one. When Thomas was nine or ten, his father had had a breakdown. “Nervous breakdown” was the expression they used then. He had been supposed to preach. The moment had come to go up into the pulpit, but he had been unable to. He had had to go home. Perhaps the pagan people of Blackpool had finally got the better of him. Afterward, Thomas’s family had gone on the longest holiday they ever took together. A month in Devon. They had stayed in an abandoned zoo, of all things, sleeping in old animal houses that had been converted into holiday cabins. Soon after Father’s breakdown and that holiday, they had left Blackpool and moved to London. This was one of the watersheds, and, looking back, Thomas realized that his memories of Father from this point on were rather different, rather sadder. The expression “new challenge” was used, though Thomas didn’t know who had said it. Dad was given a new challenge: a big church in a thriving well-to-do suburb of London. People in high places believed in him. He was a man who needed to give energy where energy would be well received. An evangelical cannot thrive in a world of May Queens. Or not for long. At school, Thomas had to drop his northern accent to avoid being laughed at. Did Father have to change his accent in the pulpit? To suit the good folk of North London? Thomas had no recollection. Thinking about this now, he found it odd. Life had slipped by unnoticed. Or perhaps he, Thomas, at ten years old, had been so focussed on his new life—the need to make new friends, the new vicarage with the big garden, the bus to school, and later the bus and tube to another school, right in the heart of London—so taken by all this novelty that he had barely noticed his father, who went on preaching in much the same way, it seemed to Thomas, albeit from a different pulpit. Did he have any recollection of talking to Father, one on one, during this period, in his adolescence, about anything that mattered? Girls, sex, religion, smoking, drinking? He did not. He really didn’t. What Thomas did remember, though, was the growing antagonism between his father and his brother, and his father’s frustration over his sister’s failure at school. He remembered these things because they had caused him pain. His sister was a good Christian, but not smart. One day, she had run away from school, because she couldn’t face her teachers. Father was angry with her. She locked herself in the bathroom, and he banged on the door with his fists. “You shall come out!” Mother tried to mediate, but she was shocked, too: they hadn’t expected this of his sister. Meanwhile, his brother grew his hair long, smoked cigarettes and dope, drank, had inappropriate girlfriends, and listened to evil music. But he did well in school and could beat Father at chess, which was not easy. Thomas saw clearly now how his father had failed to see things clearly then. He had failed to accept that his daughter was not going to do well at school and that his son was not going to be a staunch Christian. He had allowed these entirely ordinary developments to frustrate him beyond measure. He had castigated himself. He saw the failings as his own, because it was unthinkable that they could be God’s. Meanwhile, Thomas did well enough at school and toed the line at church. He was sent to a school some miles away, to keep him from his brother’s evil influence. And his behavior was exemplary. Thomas did not smoke or listen to psychedelic music, and, when he swore, it was out of the earshot of parents and sister. Yet even Thomas was not quite what his father wanted. He preferred literature to the sciences, and Father was convinced that the truth lay in the sciences, the sciences and theology. Everything else was wishy-washy humanism. At church, Thomas was more obedient than fervent. He went to church only because he would feel guilty if he didn’t. He would feel he had let his parents down. Of course, he would have preferred it himself if he had felt fervent about church. He would have liked to like his duties. It would have been such a relief. But, try as he might, he didn’t. All this was in the air but never talked about. Father could hardly complain, because there was objectively nothing in Thomas’s behavior to complain about. Father could confront Thomas’s sister when she hid in the bathroom instead of going to school. He could confront Thomas’s brother when he was caught smoking at his bedroom window or when he started to paint pictures of naked women and said he wanted to go to art college. For better or for worse, there was a relationship there; there was heat. Father would bang on the bathroom door; he would shout. Sometimes he would even strike Thomas’s brother, then afterward he’d be fearfully friendly, because he had overdone it. He would embrace him, and Thomas’s sister, too. But there was nothing he could shout at Thomas about. So, in a way, Thomas didn’t have a relationship with his father, as the others did. Now that he thought about it, Thomas could not remember a single conversation with his father throughout his teens. Nothing. Not one exchange of any import or intimacy at all. When he had found that verse in the Bible, “I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot,” he knew the words were meant for him. His father was a hot man. His balding dome flamed with color when his anger got the better of him. His brother was a cool customer. “Temper, temper,” he needled their sister. But Thomas was neither. “So then because thou art lukewarm,” the Good Book said, “I will spue thee out of my mouth.” That was how God felt about it. Mr. Lukewarm, Thomas thought. I am Mr. Lukewarm. It was a Saturday evening now, and Thomas was alone, sitting at his computer screen. It had been a pleasant enough day—he had gone swimming, shopping, had lunch with a friend. But now he began to feel anxious. Now he began to understand where all this was leading, these reflections that he had avoided for thirty years. The truth was that although he had talked to a lawyer about divorce, although he had got the documents, Thomas still hadn’t quite done the deed. He saw that now. The thought of that final confrontation with his wife, the signing of the documents, pained him. You are marooned, Thomas told himself. Mothballed. For the depression. He thought again of that rainy Saturday morning when, short of breath and nauseated, his father had led his younger son in the awesome promise: With this ring . . . with this ring . . . I thee wed . . . I thee wed. First his father’s voice, then his own, as they stood face to face at the bottom of the chancel steps. With my body . . . with my body . . . I thee worship . . . I thee worship. It seemed to Thomas now that that must have been the most intimate moment they had ever known. In the name of the father . . . In the name of the father . . . and of the son . . . and of the son. How old had Father been that day, the day before his cancer was diagnosed, the day of the very last ceremony he would ever perform, not knowing it was the last? Fifty-nine. Dad had been fifty-nine. How old was Thomas now? Fifty-eight. Thomas was electrified. This was what he had come back to his father for. To ask himself what the man’s life had been like in his fifties, when the family melodrama was over and the decisive battle lost. But easy does it. Put it all in order, Thomas thought, before jumping to conclusions. Go back. Back back back to adolescence. “The siege was yesterday.”Buy the print » The most memorable development that had to do with his father, the most decisive watershed, was the Charismatic Movement. His parents had at first resisted, then succumbed to the excitement. It must have been an evangelical version of the ’68 aberration, the need for upheaval and change. Certainly there was an American influence. Soon Mother and Father were reading out I Corinthians 12 at every opportunity, St. Paul’s account of the gifts of the spirit: there were words of wisdom, gifts of healing, gifts of prophecy. Then, one Sunday morning, the curate raised his arms on the chancel steps and spoke in tongues. It sounded babbled and weird, and the man’s face was ecstatic. This was the baptism in the spirit. Needless to say, many parishioners were disgusted. Then Thomas had heard his father and his mother doing the same thing in their bedroom. Babbling. Then his father had declared in church that he believed in these gifts—it was the Renewal they had all been praying for—and he, too, had spoken in tongues from the chancel steps and raised his arms to Heaven in ecstasy when singing a hymn. Thomas couldn’t remember now which hymn. All hymns at the time had seemed painful to him, laden with sad sentiment, with some sticky emotion that held you back. To sing a hymn was to struggle through warm mud, to feel the impossibility of ever growing up and being free. Very soon, the pressure on the children began. They, too, must be baptized in the spirit. They, too, must speak in tongues. It was never declared overtly, but it was obvious that if you weren’t, if you didn’t, then you couldn’t be part of the inner fellowship, the core family. His sister got there in no time at all. In no time at all, she was babbling away and praising God and talking about the Latter Days. It made school exams seem rather less important. Thomas fudged it, of course. Thomas pretended he was on board, but mostly studied for his O levels. His parents wouldn’t want to stop him studying, would they? Thomas did try to see if he could speak in tongues; he might even have liked to, had it come naturally. With all the sincerity he could muster, he asked God for guidance and hazarded a few nonsense words; they were not convincing. Meanwhile, people noticed that he did not raise his hands during the hymns. He couldn’t. All in all, it was getting harder and harder to keep your head down. Sitting at his computer screen now, Thomas saw that Father had embraced this heady Charismatic stuff to break a deadlock, to make something happen in his life. He hadn’t been able to go to sea like his own father. He hadn’t become a missionary in exotic lands. It was true that many souls had been won for Jesus, but then they had drifted away again. People blew hot and cold. The May Queen had been abolished, but no doubt she had returned after the reforming vicar had grown too depressed and disheartened to climb the pulpit stairs. There had been the new challenge in London, and he had risen to it—he had done well, the congregation had flourished—but his daughter had failed at school, his older son was an atheist, a smoker, and a libertine, and his youngest child a mere conformist, a cowardly sail-trimmer. Father had written a book in those years, on the Holy Trinity, but it had not been accepted. Or, rather, it had been accepted, but only by some minor publisher, not the publisher he’d wanted. It had not made an impression. Exactly what was in the book Thomas didn’t know. His father hadn’t talked about it, though Thomas was not so stupid, even in his mid-teens, that you couldn’t talk to him about a book. So if Father hadn’t talked about his book on the Holy Trinity it was because he was scared of exposing his ideas to his son’s skepticism. Or maybe he didn’t want to push this lukewarm lad into a position where he would have to declare himself. Either way, they hadn’t spoken about it. They hadn’t spoken about anything. Then suddenly this mad wave of enthusiasm was flowing through the church; there was talk of healing and the spiritual power to transform the world. Frustrated, Thomas’s father had gone for it. To prove the worth of a weapon you must use it. For six months, a year, the tension in the family soared. They all became more and more themselves. Violently, dangerously themselves. His father prayed and prophesied. His sister was a shrill echo. His brother made fun, hissing and sniggering like a demon. His mother wept; this unkindness would bring her down with gray hairs to her grave. In response, Thomas was intensely well behaved. He hid in his good behavior. In his room, he hung posters of football teams and tinkered with old valve radios. If he could have become invisible, he would. From downstairs came the sound of his sister banging out “Onward, Christian Soldiers” on the piano. Very soon, things would come to a head. In his small flat, Thomas had put on the kettle for tea. Now he changed his mind and poured himself a beer. He honestly couldn’t recall the details, exactly how or why it had happened, but one evening, in the lounge, around midnight, they exorcised his brother. Thomas was fifteen. His brother had come home late. Perhaps smelling of dope or drink. From his bedroom, Thomas heard shouting and started to go downstairs. The lounge door was closed. A pale-green door. From behind it came shouts and the chants of prayers, the piano, a hymn. “Yes, Lord, yes!” And his brother was shouting, too. “Leave me alone! Get your hands off me! Let me go! You’re all fucking crazy!” Thomas stood on the stairs, looking at the pale-green paint on the door, listening. His whole family was in there. His father, his mother, his sister, his brother. The curate, too, by the sound of it. The loathsome curate with his ecstatic babble. They were all there, behind that door in that room, where a real drama was taking place. The drama between people who are hot and people who are cold. Thomas was outside. Thomas had not rushed down the last steps, burst into the room, and yelled at them to stop this nonsense. Thomas was young. He was afraid. He was excluded. He was not really on anyone’s side. He didn’t want to be like his parents, but he didn’t like the way his brother provoked them. Because thou art lukewarm I will spue thee out of my mouth. Was this, Thomas wondered, why he was on his own now, forty and more years later, on a Saturday night, bivouacked on a metaphorical mountainside, with no one beside him? Because he was lukewarm? And if it was, was it really a problem? Thomas rather liked his apartment, didn’t he, and his quiet cold evenings. When the exorcism had failed, when Thomas’s brother wasn’t purged or broken but continued to be who he had always been, when the desired transformation did not take place and life returned, if not to normal, then certainly to monotony and flatness, as when a flood withdraws after the tempest, what had his father’s life been like then? How had he been able to go on, to traverse day by day the grim domestic mudscape that was left? The nine sad mothballed years before the cancer choked him? A year after the exorcism, Thomas had gone on a last holiday with his parents, to Deal, on the south coast. This was where his father and mother had spent their honeymoon. They even got the same room in the same hotel, right on the seafront. But there wasn’t much joy now. Thomas felt too old to holiday with his parents. His brother and sister were elsewhere. His parents seemed deflated, directionless, particularly his mother. They were going through the motions. They were trying to revive something. Father gritted his teeth. He suggested that he and Thomas rise early and take a swim before breakfast. It would be bracing. Thomas would have preferred to sleep late but didn’t want to disappoint. So they got up at seven, put on their swimming trunks, crossed the road to the sea, laid their towels on the pebbles, and waded in. The days it rained, they put the towels in plastic bags. The sea was gray. Thomas could still see his father’s body, birdlike but paunchy. His skin was dead white, his old red trunks baggy and slack. When the waves came up to his thighs, he would stop for a while, moving his hands back and forth in the cold water, crouching a little after a wave passed to keep his wrists covered, standing on tiptoe when the next wave rose to keep it off his crotch. “Wonderful air,” he shouted to Thomas. “So fresh.” He made a theatre of puffing out his chest and breathing deeply, and when finally he ducked his head into the water he would come up sputtering and protesting and flapping his arms. It was the theatre of someone trying to turn grayness into fun, trying to find a reason to rejoice. Thomas was aware now that he hadn’t been much help to his father. He’d launched into the first big wave and swum steadily out to sea. When he’d stopped and turned, treading water, the Reverend Sanders had been a small bald figure in a vast expanse of gray. The years after that yielded nothing. Father started using aftershave and wearing colored shirts, even silk cravats. He looked quite the dandy. For Christmas, one gave him bath salts or body lotion. After lunch, he snoozed in an armchair, his trousers loosened. At dinner, he was as impatient as ever. He scraped the custard off his plate and hurried off to his sermons. That was the one time when he really came alive: preaching, persuading, seducing even, in his robes, from the pulpit. To Thomas’s brother, years on, Father had apologized. So his brother said. An awkward, hurried apology about the “too much religion we drummed into you.” And once, when Thomas came home late and was in the kitchen drinking coffee, his father had come down to pick at beef bones in the fridge and, with his mouth full, muttered, “I suppose it has been all right, in the end, this monogamous life.” Had that been an invitation to talk? Thomas drank another beer and emptied a pack of nuts into a dish. He closed the document on his computer screen. What sort of life could his father have lived if he had openly declared that he no longer believed, no longer wanted to preach, no longer wanted his marriage? It was unthinkable. Mother would have been destroyed. His sister, and perhaps his brother, too, in a way. Thomas went back in his mind to those morning swims at Deal. Now that he thought about it, there had been a kind of melancholy father-and-son intimacy about them. He remembered the pebbles dark with dew, their slippery hardness when he took his plastic sandals off a couple of yards from the water. Dad put his glasses in his sandals, so as to be sure where they were. “What can you see without them?” Thomas asked. “The sea,” Father said, laughing. “The sky.” After a warm bed, the water was icy about your ankles. The breeze was chill. The pebbles were painful underfoot. Father began his spluttering routine, then his slow, blind breaststroke. Thomas put his head down and dived. He swam strongly out toward the dark horizon. Stroke after stroke. A powerful freestyle. He was showing off, of course, declaring the vigor and victory of youth. At the same time, it had been a pleasure to have his father there, in the water behind him, between him and the shore. He had felt protected somehow. He remembered that. Now Thomas has swum out too far, and he stops and turns. He treads water, looking back at England’s coast, the long sweep of quaint, decaying façades, the pale clouds. The sea is all around, a slow gray swell. Dimly, he hears his father’s voice. “Tommy! Tommy!” Where is he? There. A wave rises and his father’s head with it. A small white dot. I can see him, Thomas thinks, but with his poor eyesight he can’t see me. “Tommy! Hey, Tommeee!” He’s worried for me, Thomas realizes. He’s worried that I’ve gone too far and may never make it back. "
The New Yorker,L,The U.K.’s “Mr. Austerity” Doubles Down - The New Yorker,"

The last time I wrote about George Osborne, the international poster boy for austerity policies, he was celebrating a return to growth in the U.K. economy and declaring victory in his campaign to prove that Herbert Hoover and Andrew Mellon were right, after all. On Wednesday, Osborne, Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer and Second Lord of the Treasury, was back in the House of Commons, presenting his final annual policy review before the general election that is due to take place in May. Once again, he reasserted the age-old doctrine of fiscal rectitude. Indeed, he doubled down on it.  One thing you can’t accuse Osborne of is trying to bribe voters. To be sure, he did unveil a couple of preëlection giveaways, including a cut in the excise tax on most home purchases. If he hadn’t pulled one or two Christmas presents out of his hat, his colleagues in the Conservative Party, which is currently trailing the opposition Labour Party in the polls, would have been justifiably outraged. But the main message of his presentation was that a Conservative victory in the coming election would be followed by even steeper cuts in government spending than the ones that he has introduced since taking over, in 2010. “Mr Speaker, our long-term economic plan is working,” Osborne declared in his Autumn Statement. “Now Britain faces a choice: Do we squander the economic security we have gained … [o]r do we finish the job? … I say: we stay the course.”if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } I’ll get to the claim that the Conservatives’ economic plan is working in a bit. But, first, what would staying the course entail? With an election in the offing, the Chancellor didn’t get into the details of which programs would be cut. Instead, he merely reaffirmed his commitment to balance the budget by 2018, and, thereafter, to run a surplus. But the Office for Budget Responsibility (O.B.R.), Britain’s official fiscal watchdog, which has access to the government’s detailed spending plans, filled in some of the blanks with its December Economic and Fiscal Outlook, also released on Wednesday. Setting aside a few protected areas, such as the National Health Service, Osborne isn’t merely arresting the growth of government programs, which is what modest forms of austerity often amount to: he’s cutting them back, often drastically. “Between 2009-10 and 2019-20, spending on public services, administration and grants by central government is projected to fall from 21.2 per cent to 12.6 per cent of GDP and from £5,650 to £3,880 per head in 2014-15 prices,” the Office for Budget Responsibility wrote. That’s a cut of about third, and it has been concentrated on some of the least affluent members of British society, such as welfare recipients, low-paid workers, and people who use public services like libraries and drop-in centers. And, far from slackening the pace of the cuts, Osborne is looking to step them up during the next parliament, if the Conservatives win. Indeed, according to the O.B.R., fully sixty per cent of Osborne’s cuts are yet to come.  This isn’t just budget-cutting: it is social engineering on a grand scale. The accompanying chart, which is taken from the O.B.R.’s December outlook, tells the story. If the next government sticks to Osborne’s strategy, the chart shows, over-all government spending as a percentage of G.D.P. would fall to 35.2 per cent in 2019. That’s the lowest figure since the nineteen thirties—before the post-war establishment of the National Health Service and expansion of secondary education and social services; before the aging of the baby boomers, which will put a strain on public pensions; and before the major expansion of tertiary public education that took place in the nineteen-nineties. I’ve long said that Osborne isn’t merely, or even mainly, a deficit hawk. He’s a roll-back-the-government conservative who, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, spotted a historic opportunity to complete the work that Margaret Thatcher began. With the deficit soaring to ten per cent of G.D.P. as tax revenues collapsed, and with the spending policies of the Labour Party, which had governed since 1997, being widely blamed for what had happened, Osborne realized that the British public would be willing to accept deep cuts in spending and services—especially if they were targeted at welfare recipients, local government employees, and other folks routinely subjected to vilification in the Tory press. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Osborne must surely have suspected that his spending cuts (and tax increases) would knock the economy back into a recession, which they duly did. But he was willing to take the gamble, and the political heat, in order to put Britain back on the path to smaller government that Thatcher had laid down. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }If the Conservatives get reëlected and the British public sanctions another five years of austerity, Osborne will be able to declare victory in his grand project. Even if the Conservatives lose, he has shifted the terms of public debate so far to the right that the next Labour government won’t be in a position to abandon austerity policies—only to moderate them. The Labour Party’s leadership is desperate to show a skeptical public that it wouldn’t lead Britain back to 2008-2009, and has promised to “balance the books and deliver a surplus on the current budget”—which includes day-to-day expenditures, such as welfare payments, but doesn’t include capital projects, such as the construction of new roads—“and falling debt during the next parliament.” By boxing in Labour and delivering some of the types of spending cuts that American conservatives dream about imposing, Osborne has shown that he is, by far, the most significant figure in Britain’s coalition government. But that doesn’t mean anybody should take at face value his claim that his macroeconomic policies are working, to which I’ll now return. On the plus side, the U.K.’s gross domestic product has expanded by about three per cent in 2014, making it the fastest-growing economy in Europe. Osborne’s critics, myself included, didn’t foresee this rate of growth, and neither did the official forecasters. This time last year, the O.B.R. predicted growth of 2.4 per cent. But the recovery has to be balanced against what went before. After contracting by more than five per cent in 2009, G.D.P. grew at annual rate of less than 1.2 per cent in the four years from 2010 to 2013. Because growth has been so slow, tax revenues have barely risen, and the budget deficit has remained stubbornly high. For the 2014-2015 fiscal year, which ends next March, it will come in at 5.2 per cent of G.D.P., according to the O.B.R. In the United States, which kept its fiscal stimulus going longer and eased off it more gradually, the deficit is already down to 2.7 per cent of G.D.P., or roughly half the U.K.’s level. While the experiment of employing two starkly different policies on either side of the Atlantic wasn’t a controlled trial, and the external circumstances of the U.S. and the U.K. differed, the results were far from a vindication of austerity measures. Orthodox—i.e., Keynesian—policies led to faster growth and a lower deficit. Among economists, a keen debate is taking place about why the British economy has been able to grow despite Osborne’s austerity policies. Several factors appear to be important, starting with the fact that the economy had a lot of spare capacity and pent-up demand. Beginning last year, Britain’s consumers started to spend more and save less. (In the past couple of years, the country’s personal-savings rate has dipped sharply.) It was this rise in consumer spending, which surprised almost everybody, that sparked the economic recovery. What prompted the upturn in shopping? Osborne and his colleagues would like you to believe that it was the confidence fairy at work: that, after three years of austerity, the British public decided that the government’s policies were working and so, feeling more optimistic about the future, decided to go out and spend more. A more persuasive story is that Osborne, despite his ongoing commitment to austerity, managed to engineer a stimulus in the housing market, which got house prices—a key driving force in the modern British economy—rising again. In his 2013 budget, Osborne launched a “Help to Buy” scheme, which enabled home buyers to borrow up to ninety-five per cent of the cost of a home, with the government guaranteeing their mortgages. In a country that has long been plagued by boom-and-bust cycles in real estate, this was a cynical move, but it was also a clever one. Because the government’s financial commitment came in the form of loan guarantees, it didn’t have much impact on the budget deficit, and so the Iron Chancellor could claim that he hadn’t budged. And because mortgage rates were so low—less than two per cent, in some cases—the policy had a good chance of working. It did. By the end of last year, house prices were rising all across the country, and by this summer it was like old times, with the rate of inflation for houses hitting 12.4 per cent. Some of Osborne’s supporters would have you believe that he has overturned the precepts of mainstream economics and proved that fiscal contractions can boost growth. He’s done no such thing. For the first three years after he took office, growth was dismal or non-existent. In the past couple years, he has shown that highly expansionary monetary policy, if it is combined with a concerted effort to ramp up house prices, can eventually offset some of the impacts of austerity policies. That’s an achievement of sorts, but not one he’s keen to advertise.

The informal nationwide civic movement that has emerged in Mexico in response to the disappearance of forty-three students is propelled by people and groups with all kinds of agendas and ambitions.

This is the fourth part in Francisco Goldman’s series on the recent upheaval in Mexico. He has also written “The Disappearance of the Forty Three,” “Could Mexico’s Missing Students Spark a Revolution,” and “The Protests for the Missing Forty Three.” In mid November, three caravans converged on Mexico City, led by family members of the forty-three students from the Ayotzinapa Normal School whose abduction, in late September, has led to nationwide protests. One caravan was coming directly from Guerrero State, where the students disappeared, another from the state of Chiapas, and another from the city of Atenco, in Mexico State, the site of the most notorious act of violent government repression committed by Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexico’s current President, in 2006, when he was governor there. The plan was for the caravans to come together and for the travellers to lead a giant march on November 20th.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } The kidnapping is now known to have been carried about by the municipal police of Iguala, Guerrero, on orders from the city’s mayor. According to the government, the police handed the students over to a local narco gang, which murdered them and burned their remains in the Cocula municipal dump. This scenario is still awaiting forensic confirmation, and the families of the missing students, and many others, do not accept it. “They were taken alive, we want them back alive!’ remains one of the most common chants at the marches. “It was the state!” and “Peña Out!” are also staple slogans. As the caravans approached Mexico City, President Peña Nieto, along with members and supporters of his PRI government, began issuing statements and warnings that seemed to signal an aggressive new strategy to counter the protests. On November seventeenth, Beatriz Pagés Rebollar, the country’s Secretary of Culture, published an editorial on the PRI’s official website. “The chain of protests and acts of vandalism—perfectly well orchestrated—replicated in various parts of the country, demonstrate that the disappearances and probable extermination of the 43 normal-school students were part of a strategic trap aimed at Mexico,” she wrote. “All these activists and propagandists have the same modus operandi.” Pagés included opposition media on her list of these activists and propagandists, accusing them of fraudulently confusing Mexicans into believing that the students’ disappearance “was a crime of state, as if the Mexican government gave the order to exterminate them.” Two days later, Carlos Alazraki, a veteran PRI insider and an advertising executive who has worked on the election campaigns of several of the party’s Presidential candidates, published an editorial entitled “Open Letter to All Normal Mexicans (Like You)” in the newspaper La Razón. “46 days ago, two bands, students and Iguala narcos, got into a brawl,” he wrote. “There are varying versions of what happened. . . . That one [band] were guerrillas, the other narcos. One or the other wanted to run the whole region.” Since the start of the “narco war,” in 2006, equating victims’ criminality with that of narcos has been a routine pro-government strategy. Such insinuations characterized many of PRI supporters’ early responses to the crime in Iguala. Alazraki closed, “Dear comemierdas. I curse the hour in which you were born. You’re murderers. You hate Mexico. And to finish, let me remind you that violence generates violence. Don’t be shocked if the federal government responds.” The day before, in Mexico State, President Peña Nieto said in a speech, “There are protests that are not clear in their objectives. They appear to respond to an interest in causing destabilization, generating social disorder and, above all, in attacking the national project that we’ve been constructing.” Just a few days before that, he’d warned that the state is legitimately empowered to employ force to impose order. Peña Nieto often speaks like an actor playing a stereotypical President on a television show: talking about the legitimate use of force as though phrases like that have a magical power to insulate him from the squalid realities of authoritarian power brutally and lawlessly wielded, and of a government hopelessly compromised. (Jon Lee Anderson recently wrote about Peña Nieto.) When a President like that speaks of the legitimate use of power and describes protesters as threats to a “national project,” what people hear are threats to wield that power violently and arbitrarily. In the late afternoon hours of November 20th, people began to gather at various spots in Mexico City to meet the three Ayotzinapa caravans for the march that would converge in the Zócalo, the main plaza of Mexico City. That night, I went to the march with some friends and neighbors. By the monument El Ángel, I saw an elderly woman holding a hand-drawn sign that read, “Yes, I’m afraid! I tremble, sweat, turn pale, but I march! For Ayotzi, for me, for you, for Mexico.” As Ayotzinapa family members and students and other members of the Guerrero caravan were led to the front of the march, people chanted, “You’re not alone.” In the Ayotzinapa group was a young woman who held a swaddled baby and sobbing as she walked forward. There were machete-wielding peasant farmers from Atenco mounted on horseback. I saw many middle-class families, including children. Raucous contingents of university students joined too, of course. It seemed as if every imaginable group and sub-group, large and tiny, that exists in Mexico City was present. For a while, we marched between a contingent from a capoeira school and a marijuana-legalization group. I saw a nearly seven-foot-tall young man with long, blond hair, marching in the nude and holding up a sign that read “Sweden is Watching.” Many protesters shouted counts up to forty-three, followed by “Justicia!” “#YaMeCansé” was scrawled on countless signs, followed by whatever that marcher had “had enough” of. For instance, “#YaMeCansé of the war against those of us raising our voices. The criminals are the politicians!” Many chants were inventive or cheerfully obscene or sexual. The larger contingents, from universities and secondary schools, used rope barriers to cordon themselves off from infiltrators. People shouted at marchers wearing masks to uncover their faces. The masked marchers were presumed to be possible members of anarchist groups, or even provocateurs who would provide the police with a justification for responding with violence. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }Usually, the main significance of a march is simply that it took place: that people took the time to walk in protest or support of something, because it felt like the right outlet for their indignation or approval. But sometimes a march makes concrete a moment of collective cultural expression that can be harder to put into words. This march was an expression of Mexico City—of a way its residents like to think of themselves—in full flower. But it was also a manifestation of a discernible change that seems to be taking place throughout Mexico. When a friend said that he “could feel Mexico on the move” at the march, he didn’t seem, to me, to be exaggerating. We didn’t reach the Zócalo until about three hours after the first marchers. By then, the podium where the Ayotzinapa family members had addressed the rally was dark and empty, and I saw no sign of the giant effigy of Peña Nieto that had been set aflame, photos of which were featured, the next day, in media reports all around the world. As had occurred at the end of the previous march, a small group of anarchists (or perhaps government provocateurs) clustered in front of one door of the National Palace, apparently battling a line of armored riot police. From the distant, opposite end of the vast plaza, we could hear and see explosions and flashes, presumably from Molotov cocktails, perhaps also from tear-gas canisters fired by police. A dark mass of thousands still mulled in the Zócalo, many slowly moving toward the streets exiting the plaza. The reporter in me wanted to get a closer look at the conflagration, but the people I was with didn’t want to go any nearer. I left them waiting, and I’d walked perhaps fifty yards when I suddenly heard loud bangs and screams and sensed panic surging through the crowd. I turned around and walking back, as swiftly as I could, to where I’d left my group. When I reached them, Nayeli, a twelve-year-old girl who is our upstairs neighbor, grabbed my hand. All around us, people were now running out of the plaza, faster and with growing panic. The situation was rife with all the danger of becoming a stampede. We made our way through the darkened streets, navigating down the blocks that seemed emptiest, until we finally found a taxi. It wasn’t until the next morning that I began learning about what had happened that night in the Zócalo and the surrounding streets, including those we’d fled through. A large number of Mexico City police had suddenly emerged from the shadows on the Cathedral side of the Zócalo and charged the protesters. All around the plaza, they blocked off streets, trapping thousands inside a circle that, it turned out, we’d just escaped. Eventually, eleven protesters were arrested, but many more were beaten, clubbed, and kicked. It seems that none of the eleven who were arrested were among those who’d been attacking the palace, hurling Molotovs, or otherwise battling the police. Some were arrested while fleeing the plaza, and others in the streets around it. Witnesses used smart phones to film some of the arrests. Most of the arrested were university students. Most had begun to run from the Zócalo, like so many others in the crowd, swept up in the panic. A thirty-one-year-old named Liliana Garduño Ortega, who had been photographing the protest, fell down in the stampede. The next moment, police began clubbing her and kicking her in the head, and then arrested her. Hillary Analí González Olguín, a twenty-two-year-old university student at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), was also beaten and arrested after falling down. An art student named Atzín Andrade, twenty-nine, had become separated from his friends and was waiting for them by a flagpole when police grabbed him. Luis Carlos Pichardo, a fifty-five-year-old filmmaker, and Laurence Maxwell Ilaboca, forty-seven, a Chilean doing postgraduate studies in the Department of Philosophy and Letters at UNAM, were among the arrested. None of the eleven had any previous record. The Mexico City police turned them over to federal authorities, and they were formally accused of attempted homicide, criminal association, and rioting. They were then transferred to federal prisons in Veracruz and Nayarít. According to their lawyers and human-rights groups, the eleven were beaten, tortured, and denied due process. José Alberto, a twenty-one-year-old merchant, didn’t even know that there were going to be protests in the Zócalo that night when he arranged to meet his wife, Tamara, there. They became caught in the crowd that was charged by police. Both were beaten (his beating was especially bad) by at least ten police; he was taken to a police bus, beaten some more, and received ten or fifteen shocks, he said, from an electric prod, after which he lost consciousness. He was found lying unconscious in Corregidora Street in the early morning hours, and was then taken to a hospital. The day after the march, President Peña Nieto thanked Mexico City’s mayor, Miguel Ánhel Mancera, and his police for their coöperation with federal authorities in upholding order in the Zócalo. A few days later, an old friend of mine, Paloma Díaz, contacted me because one of the eleven, Atzín Andrade, is one of her students at La Esmeralda, the public national arts university. She drove me out to the campus, south of the city. Paloma and the school’s director, Carla Rippey, whom I’d never met, were close to the Chilean writer Roberto Bolaño during the years he spent in Mexico City in his youth; probably there is nobody now living in the city who knew him better. Bolaño wrote infatuated infrarrealista poems for a teen-aged Paloma; in “Savage Detectives,” Rippey is the inspiration for the character Catalina O’Hara, a beautiful United States-born artist living in Mexico. Bolaño was a leftist who disdained the established left, its orthodoxies, politicians, and political parties. In the early nineteen-seventies, he led a group of poets who believed that life in Mexico and in the rest of Latin America was so violent and absurd that poets needed to subvert reality and realism—as well as élitist literary hierarchies—even more than the surrealists had. That attitude has been very much in the air since the Ayotzinapa incident. Indeed, in Reforma earlier this week, the anthropologist and writer Roger Bartra, who is relatively conservative among Mexico’s most prominent public intellectuals, christened “the heterogeneous and radical protest movement that has unleashed massive marches in Mexico City” as “the infrarrealista left.” He chose that name, he writes, “not pejoratively,” but “because this left seems to flow beneath political realities, carving tunnels to topple the government and undermining the cement of a system it considers corrupt and repressive,” just as, he writes, Bolaño and his compatriots sought to “subvert a literary order they considered oppressive.” Mexico’s most lauded group of young journalist-writers—a group (nominally led by Diego Osorno) who have stripped away the reportorial clichés of the narco war and brought its previously hidden human realities to readers—also refer to themselves as infrarrealista journalists. The protests over the missing Ayotzinapa students, Paloma told me, were the first in recent memory in which students of the highly selective Esmeralda had fully participated. In the past, she said, postmodern ironies and theorizing have engaged them far more than political involvement. She added that it was amusing to see art students who have devoted their nascent careers to conceptual performance and technological videos struggle to paint posters and banners, many of them reading “43 + 11.” Rippey said that the arrest of the easy-going Atzín Andrade—who had been attending his first-ever protest march and who was being held in a federal prison on charges of “attempted homicide”—had driven home to the students that what had happened to him could happen to any of them. Rippey said that it was important, too, to temper her students’ passions. “This is a free public university,” she said, “and that was a great accomplishment. There are things in Mexico to be grateful for.” Frida Mendoza Chavez, a bright and energetic twenty-four-year-old student leader, told me, “As a student at this school, I belong to a structure that the government created and that allows me to believe in a sense of community inside of it. Allowing us to have that place in society also provides us with critical criteria to support institutional legality. From here we have a right to say that we can’t permit any more societal injustice, any more injustice toward humanity. But real reforms have to come from the trenches, where we know where we stand as a country. How can they come from the corridors of power? How can [the President] clean up anything when he himself is a product of corruption and impunity?” Mendoza’s eloquent speech (“That came out sounding good!” she exclaimed happily) reflected what, to me at least, is one of the most important and overlooked aspects of this so-called “Mexican moment.” The informal nationwide civic movement that has emerged is, undoubtedly, infrarrealista in many ways; it is propelled by people and groups with all kinds of agendas and ambitions, including the most intransigent or irrational ones. But, from what I’ve observed, it is incorrect to portray it—as the government’s supporters, and some eminent intellectual observers, do—either as a movement for radical or violent Communist revolution or else as an unfocussed mass of rabble-rousers who think that merely marching constitutes a movement. In recent days, a group of Mexican artists released a video called “What’s Happening in Mexico. Why We Say #YaMeCansé,” which powerfully condenses the causes and aims of the emerging movement. A written statement accompanying the video describes it as a response to “the critical situation in which the lives of so many Mexicans have fallen, who have to deal every day with the impunity, impotence and danger that comes with living in a country that doesn’t provide security, governed by a state that, far from preoccupying itself with imparting justice, colludes closely with organized crime and, on top of everything else, is determined to hide the truth of these facts.” The artists suggest the creation of a “Citizens Institute empowered to audit the state and begin creating the conditions that can bring justice to the citizens of Mexico.” Nearly a year ago, in February, after Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán, the drug lord at the head of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, was captured, Edgardo Buscaglia, a Mexican security expert and senior research scholar at Columbia Law School, commented, “El Chapo and his people in Sinaloa had hundreds of Mexican politicians in their pockets. Let’s see if they arrest any of them now.” Of course they haven’t. Buscaglia said that as long as the chains of complicity between politicians and narco lords weren’t interrupted, the narco war could be considered lost. The Ayotzinapa tragedy made those chains starkly clear. Meanwhile, the clearest example of corruption in Mexico at the moment seems to be President Peña Nieto himself. He cannot credibly explain how a relatively young civil servant from a middle-class family has managed to accumulate as much wealth as he has. The most publicized (though not the only) evidence of this wealth is the seven-million-dollar mansion that the President says belongs to his wife, a soap-opera star who hasn’t worked since 2007. The title on the house is owned by a construction corporation that has won contracts (some of them controversial) from Peña Nieto’s administrations during both his governorship and his Presidency. Last week, when given an award by the Committee to Protect Journalists for his lifetime contribution to the freedom of the press, Jorge Ramos, the Univision broadcaster, spoke about Peña Nieto in a way that no broadcaster, and very few Mexican politicians, has dared. “Can you imagine what would happen here in the United States if a government contractor secretly financed the private home of Michelle Obama? Well . . . that is what’s happening in Mexico and, believe it or not, there’s not even one independent investigation being held to look into this matter,” he said. “That’s not saving Mexico. That’s corruption.” On November 27th, Peña Nieto announced ten measures intended to pull Mexico out of its current crisis. He suggested disbanding the country’s municipal forces and uniting them under the control of state police. He suggested a national emergency telephone number. He revived the idea of strengthening the anti-corruption prosecutor. The proposals, however fell flat, and were mostly derided in Mexico and abroad. If state police are corrupt, too—and so are the federal police—what good can it do to put them under the same command? As the popular radio host Sopitas commented, “If first you don’t effectively clean up corruption, uniting the police is the equivalent of institutionalizing the narco police.” Others said that a national emergency number, because of organized-crime corruption, would only serve to alert narco groups of actions being taken against them. Peña Nieto’s measures admitted no culpability on his government’s part, and no member of his cabinet was made to resign over the handling of the crisis. No concrete anti-corruption measures were taken against top-tier politicians. Then again, how can Peña Nieto take on government corruption and impunity when he has become the most obvious symbol of those ills? On Saturday, November 29th, a federal judge freed the eleven people arrested on November 20th, saying that there was absolutely no evidence to support the charges against them. It was a sharp rebuke to the government, and a victory for all those who had protested and denounced the arrests. On December 1st, the second anniversary of his Presidency, Peña Nieto was greeted by a poll that showed his approval rating at thirty-nine per cent, the lowest for any Mexican President since 1995, following Mexico’s disastrous peso devaluation. That night, there was another massive protest in the capital. To avoid the police trap provided by the geography of the Zócalo, the usual direction of the march was reversed, to proceed from the Zócalo to El Ángel. It seemed that it would be easier for crowds to disperse from the multi-spoked traffic rotary surrounding the monument, with streets leading into a busy commercial and tourist zone. Violent anarchists, about thirty in number, showed up again, providing police with pretexts to attack non-violent bystanders. A smart-phone video shared on social media shows a police commander using violent language and ordering his men to grab anyone they see running. A number of people, including women, were beaten. Maps of the surrounding streets, marking in red areas that protestors heading home should avoid, circulated on Twitter. A crowd of about a hundred protesters was about to be engulfed by police when a group from the city’s human-rights commission showed up and formed a human cordon to protect them. The protesters chanted against violence while the human-rights workers walked them to a subway station.

The New Yorker,L,Rohan Marley’s Marijuana Venture,"

 


“My father was the first entrepreneur in the family,” Rohan Marley, the sixth of Bob Marley’s eleven children, said the other day. “He started his own record label, his own restaurant. He knew that, in order to give something back to the people, he had to create. You can’t be no philanthropist, no Warren Buffett, unless you make something first.” Rohan, who is forty-two, is also an entrepreneur. He has a leadership role in several of his family’s businesses, including House of Marley (headphones, speakers), Zion Rootswear (T-shirts, onesies), and Marley Coffee. The family’s newest venture, which will launch next year, is called Marley Natural. “It’s a particular plant,” Rohan said, of the company’s inventory. “One that grows naturally next to the mango tree, the mint, the paprika. The Hindu sages speak of it. The rabbis speak of it.” It is marijuana.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } Marley Natural is a partnership between the Marley estate and Privateer Holdings, “a private equity firm shaping the future of the legal cannabis industry.” (Privateer owns one of the largest providers of medical marijuana in Canada.) In a video on MarleyNatural.com, a camera rushes toward verdant mountains. “He advocates for the positive power of the herb,” a voice-over says. Bob Marley, in archival footage, flips his dreadlocks. The logo is a Lion of Judah between two green leaves. Rohan, who recently shaved his dreadlocks, wore a ruffled white shirt and a porkpie hat. He sat in the company’s new office, on the Bowery. Around the table were Brendan Kennedy, the C.E.O. of Privateer, and James Estime, Marley’s valet. “Three Little Birds” played on a House of Marley stereo. “James, turn the music down,” Rohan said. Estime, a burly man wearing a winter vest, picked up Marley’s iPhone and lowered the volume. “I got hot.”Buy the print » Marley grew up in Jamaica, and moved to the U.S. at the age of twelve. He was a star linebacker at the University of Miami, even though he was shorter than most of his teammates, who included Ray Lewis and Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson. (“Bob’s boys, we’re not scared of tall mountains,” Marley said.) Later, he toured with the Melody Makers, his siblings’ reggae band. “I was practicing to become a drummer,” Marley said. “Unfortunately, at that time I was with a woman who thought my drumming was shit. She killed my spirit to be a musician.” Her name is Lauryn Hill. They are no longer together. In 1999, he bought a coffee plantation in Jamaica. Meanwhile, Kennedy got an M.B.A. from Yale and worked for an affiliate of Silicon Valley Bank. “My job was to study niche industries,” Kennedy said. “One day, I heard a pitch from a company in the medical-cannabis space, and I went, ‘This is a forty-billion-dollar market, and no one’s taking it seriously.’ ” He left the bank and started Privateer. “We’d been approached by one million people about selling Bob Marley pipes, lighters, you name it,” Marley said. The Marleys turned them all down, until Creative Artists Agency, which represents the family, set up a meeting with Privateer. “When I met this guy”—he gestured toward Kennedy—“I knew: This is the man.” Kennedy shrugged appreciatively. “We’re looking at four to six botanical strains, at first,” Kennedy said. “The quality of the herb is very important to us,” Marley said. Marley Natural plans to sell smokable cannabis in countries where it is legal—the Netherlands, Uruguay—and, perhaps, in Colorado, Washington State, Oregon, and Alaska. “We’ll also offer a line of topical creams,” Kennedy said. A Privateer employee interrupted with a bit of news: the Oxford English Dictionary had just named “vape” the word of the year. A plan was formed: a trip to a nearby vaping lounge, where e-cigarettes are sold and sampled. Marley Natural plans to carry smoking accessories, and Kennedy believes in market research. “You guys go,” Marley said. “It’s too cold for that shit.” Eventually, he was persuaded. Estime helped him with his coat. At the Henley Vaporium, in Nolita, Marley sat at the “e-cig bar” and browsed a menu of flavors—Psychotherapy, Stop and Frisk, Cereal Killa. Justin Haber, the “vapologist” on duty, took apart an e-cigarette to show how it worked. “Can you smoke anything you want out of that?” Kennedy asked. Haber stiffened. “Hypothetically, if you had the proper—why are you asking?” “Don’t worry, brother,” Marley said. “We’re starting a company, selling the herb aboveboard. Called Marley Natural. I’m one of Bob’s boys, you understand?” Haber arched his brows. “All legal?” “Hundred per cent,” Marley said. “In that case, fuck yeah,” Haber said. “A couple drops of hash oil in the tank, you’re good to go. Just be careful—that shit hits you like a Mack truck to the face.” if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ?

The New Yorker,L,A New Deal for the Kurds - The New Yorker,"

For months, it seemed, the next new country to rise from the rubble of the Middle East was not the thing called the Islamic State, which wouldn’t be likely to get a seat in the United Nations any time soon, but the region in northeastern Iraq called Kurdistan. Iraq, like Syria, was disintegrating, and the Kurds were only too happy to gather its pieces for themselves. But for now—and, in all likelihood, for many months—Kurdistan’s bid for independence is on hold. On Tuesday, Iraq’s leaders announced an agreement to share the country’s oil revenues with the Kurds, resolving the differences that most immediately threatened to break up the country. “The deal is a win-win for both sides,” Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi Minister for Finance and also a senior Kurdish leader, said.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } }  The announcement ended a high-stakes gambit by the Kurds, who, emboldened by vast discoveries of oil reserves in their region, were threatening to declare independence unless they got a larger share of oil revenues from Baghdad, which controls its own oil fields. Last March, hoping to break the Kurds, then Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki cut off the flow of government money to Kurdistan, leaving regional leaders unable to pay their civil servants and soldiers. Meanwhile, the Kurds began to unilaterally export their own oil, in a fly-by-night operation that sent their tankers, with satellite beacons switched off, searching the seas for buyers. The confrontation was years in the making. After the American invasion in 2003, leaders of the Kurdish minority (about seventeen per cent of the country’s population) began inviting foreign companies to search for oil. Soon after, the Kurds began making their own deals with those companies to extract oil and sell it abroad. Back in Baghdad, Iraq’s leaders denounced the Kurdish moves; in fact, the language of the Iraqi constitution, ratified in 2005, is vague on the subject. As the rest of Iraq imploded, the Kurds left little doubt that their ultimate aim was to form their own country. You can hardly blame the Kurds for wanting out. Since Iraq was carved out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire, in 1920, their experience has been marked by invasion, repression, and mass murder, especially at the hands of Saddam Hussein. The Kurds still call the nineteen-eighties, when Saddam’s forces killed a hundred and eighty thousand Kurdish civilians, the War of Annihilation. In recent years, the Kurds’ sense of distance from the rest of Iraq has been increased by the disparity in their living conditions; while Baghdad burned, the Kurds enjoyed peace and a booming economy. “We are talking about a culture of life,” Fuad Hussein, a senior Kurdish leader, told me earlier this year. “They are busy with a culture of death.” Then came the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham. In June, fighters from the group swept out of the Syrian desert and into northern and western Iraq. At first, it looked as though the incursion would enable Kurdish independence. As the Iraqi Army (built at enormous American expense) collapsed before the ISIS onslaught, Kurdish leaders sent the peshmerga—the Kurdish army—into a wide swath of largely Kurdish-populated areas that were, until then, held by the government in Baghdad. Among the newly seized areas were the oil fields around Kirkuk, which greatly expanded Kurdish reserves. Over the summer, Masoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdish Regional Government, called on the Kurdish parliament to set a date for a referendum on the question of independence. “We have international support for independence,” Barzani told the parliament. “And those who do not support us do not oppose us.” That wasn’t quite right—every country in the region opposes a Kurdish state—but it didn’t really matter. In July, everything changed again. Fighters from ISIS, who until then had only occupied Arab lands, began pushing into Kurdish areas. The vaunted peshmerga, which many people thought would crush ISIS, was embarrassed. Suddenly, the Kurds needed help. President Obama agreed to send weapons to the Kurds, but made it clear that he was opposed to their breaking away from Iraq. At the same time, the Kurds found that selling their own oil wasn’t as easy as they had thought it would be. Many oil companies didn’t want to buy it, for fear that the government in Baghdad would sue them. The Kurds were forced to sell their oil at bargain rates, which wasn’t enough to cover the revenue lost to Baghdad. The Iraqi government had its own reasons for settling its differences with the Kurds. The main one, of course, was ISIS, which is occupying nearly a third of the country, including several towns on the outskirts of Baghdad. A deal became possible when the Iraqis—pushed by American officials—finally dumped Maliki, the brutish and sectarian Prime Minister. In his place came Haider al-Abadi, who appears to be much more conciliatory. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }For now, then, peace between the Kurds and Baghdad prevails, and Iraq, the most artificial of states, holds together. What happens next? Maybe the Kurds will decide it’s easier to remain part of Iraq than to be a land-locked, oil-rich country surrounded by hostile neighbors. But the best bet is that the deal with Baghdad will last, at most, a few years. Then the Kurds will try again. For the Kurds, there’s too much history to stay quiet for long.

"
The New Yorker,L,What the Eric Garner Grand Jury Didn’t See - The New Yorker,"

 


Credit Photograph by Ron Haviv/VII								 


In a statement on Wednesday night, Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to tell New Yorkers that the official response to the death of Eric Garner had involved everything that they would want—sympathetic calls, public mourning, a retraining of the whole police force, “so many reforms this year”—everything, that is, except criminal accountability for the officer who had held Garner in a chokehold in the moments before he died. Word had just come that a grand jury had decided not to indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, on any charge at all. De Blasio asked for calm and peaceful protests, and he did not try to defend the grand-jury decision—“Today’s outcome is one that many in our city did not want”—and it would have been hard for him to do so. There was nothing mysterious about Garner’s death, and nothing just about it, either. Because of a cell-phone video, most of the city knew it, too. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } The video was why, after de Blasio spoke, marchers took to the streets all over the city, with hundreds in Times Square. Videos have brought out crowds before; often, it’s because they show an injustice or an outrage. The Garner video had done that, but, in a way that now seems maddening, it had also promised justice. When Garner’s mother heard that it existed, she told Jonathan Blitzer, “I said to myself, ‘There is a God.’ ” Having a video removed the ambiguities often inserted into accounts of confrontations between police officers and civilians. Anyone could see Garner talking to a clutch of uniformed and plainclothesmen in front of a store on Bay Street, in Staten Island, on July 17th. He said that they should stop harassing him—the question was whether he was selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. Garner was six feet three inches tall. He was also overweight, asthmatic, and outnumbered. The video shows that he did not move on the police. They moved on him. Pantaleo’s chokehold move is visible, and visibly at odds with the N.Y.P.D.’s own regulations. Pantaleo adjusts his hold only to push Garner’s face to the pavement—he is now lying prone—by which time Garner is saying the last words that he ever will: “I can’t breathe.” Actually, these were his last words: I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. On Wednesday night, protesters were shouting those words across the city and printing them on signs. But, even on the day that Garner died, people yards away heard it (the video captures a man quoting Garner), and the police certainly did as well. When paramedics arrived, they stood around diffidently; the officers did not convey a sense of urgency about anything except getting bystanders to walk away. Garner was not a particularly healthy man, but an autopsy showed that the primary causes of death were “compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police”—the exact actions caught on camera. He was forty-three and had six children. Staten Island makes Ferguson a lot harder to explain. What happens to the platitudes used to patiently instruct us about differing witness accounts and unanswerable questions, and all the solemn wishes that a camera had recorded the confrontation between Michael Brown, who was eighteen, and officer Darren Wilson? All that uncertainty was supposed to be why the Ferguson grand jury didn’t come back with an indictment. A dispute over facts is often a reason to go to trial, not a reason to avoid it—but even so. None of that mistiness had settled over the events on Staten Island, and there were no charges there, either. And, if doubt is factored out, what’s left? Many observers will notice that in both cases the officer was white, and the dead man was black. Maybe that’s not it at all; but then New York needs to know why the grand jury turned away from what everyone else saw. The Garner case is so stark that politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand rushed to express support for a federal civil-rights investigation. Eric Holder, the Attorney General, said that there would be one—“independent, thorough, fair and expeditious”—and also talked about how Garner’s death “tested the sense of trust” between the communities and the police. (The investigation should fall to the office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, who has been nominated to succeed Holder.) “This is an American problem,” President Obama said. As a matter of process, the route to the failure to indict is probably simple: the prosecutor who presented the case led the grand jurors that way. That’s how grand juries tend to work (and why criticisms of the outcome should not be taken as an attack on individual jurors); the bar for them to find probable cause to charge a person is low, unless—as transcripts show was the case in Ferguson—prosecutors decide to raise it. Given the incarceration rates in this country, most people don’t need a video tape to know that. The proceedings in Staten Island are still secret, but Pantaleo’s lawyer, Stuart London, told the Times that his client spoke to the grand jury for two hours. (Most potential defendants don’t get that chance.) “He wanted to get across to the grand jury that it was never his intention to injure or harm anyone,” London said. Pantaleo repeated that sentiment in a statement on Wednesday, adding that he had become a police officer to “protect” people and that Garner’s death made him feel bad: “My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.” if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }A central issue in cases like this is a failure to fully value black lives. That alone can be deadly. But we should also ask about a companion problem, one that shows itself the most with regard to accountability: an over-weighting of white intentions. As any prosecutor knows, there are offenses on the books that don’t turn on a will to murder, or crude racism, or even unkindness. Officer Pantaleo says that he didn’t want to kill anyone; Officer Wilson was scared. Each of them might still have been charged with a crime.

The New Yorker,L,The Political Scene: Negotiating Climate Change - The New Yorker,"
 “Focussing on a very narrow set of countries, as we did in Kyoto, and looking for aggressive emissions cuts in the short term doesn’t do anything,” Robert Stavins, the director of the environmental economics program at the Harvard Kennedy School, says about the international conference on climate change taking place in Lima this week. Stavins joins the New Yorker staff writer Elizabeth Kolbert and host Dorothy Wickenden on this week’s Political Scene podcast to talk about the conference, which is the first of its kind since the 2009 conference in Copenhagen. They also discuss the recent United States-China agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, the evolution of the Republican Party’s pronouncements on environmental issues, and the fact that climate change remains a second-order issue to the American public. Of this, Kolbert says, “While I really think we have to applaud the administration for saying, ‘this is the best we can do in a bad situation,’ as a country we have to ask ourselves, ‘Really, is this the best we can do?’ ” You can listen to the full episode in the stream above. You can also subscribe to the podcast for free on iTunes or via RSS.

The New Yorker Strongbox
				









Strongbox is a new way for you to share information, messages, and files with our writers and editors and is designed to provide you with a greater degree of anonymity and security than afforded by conventional e-mail.
To help protect your anonymity, Strongbox is only accessible using the Tor network (https://www.torproject.org). When using Strongbox, The New Yorker will not record your I.P. address or information about your browser, computer, or operating system, nor will we embed third-party content or deliver cookies to your browser.
You can read our full privacy promise here.
The New Yorker Strongbox is powered by SecureDrop.





To get to Strongbox and begin using it to contact writers and editors at The New Yorker, just follow these two steps:

1Download and install software to access the Tor Project: https://www.torproject.org. This should only take a few minutes. 
2Once you have access to the Tor network, go to Strongbox at http://strngbxhwyuu37a3.onion, where you will find further instructions on how to submit files and messages to The New Yorker.

You will be assigned a randomly generated and unique code name as part of the process. If a writer or editor at The New Yorker wants to contact you about the information you have submitted, he or she will leave a message for you in Strongbox. These messages are the only way we will be able to reach you, and this message can only be accessed using your code name.




Our privacy promise

Strongbox is designed to be accessed only through a “hidden service” on the Tor anonymity network, which is set up to conceal both your online and physical location from us and to offer full end-to-end encryption for your communications with us. This provides a higher level of security and anonymity in your communication with us than afforded by standard e-mail or unencrypted Web forms. Strongbox does not provide perfect security. Among other risks, if you share your unique code name, or if your computer is compromised, any activities, including communications through Strongbox, should be considered compromised as well.

Gaziantep, a city in southern Turkey some forty miles from the Syrian border, has become a bustling hub at the center of the Middle East’s latest conflict. It’s a destination for spies and refugees, insurgent fighters and rebel leaders, foreign-aid workers and covert jihadists—all enmeshed in Syria’s multisided war. I recently drove to one of Gaziantep’s upscale neighborhoods, an area of pastel apartment blocks with balconies, and took pictures of American Patriot-missile batteries on a nearby hillside. They were pointed at Syria. The missiles were deployed, last year, to defend against Scuds fired at rebel militias by the government of Bashar al-Assad. (Several Scuds had struck close to the border, and occasional artillery shells landed in Turkey.) Now the fighters of the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, a.k.a. ISIS or ISIL, are also just across the border, less than an hour away. During an inspection visit in October, NATO’s Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, told American troops manning the missiles, “Your mission is more important than ever.”if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } Until this summer, when ISIS began seizing large portions of Syria and Iraq, Gaziantep—or Antep, as the locals call it—was best known for its baklava. The city’s 1.5 million inhabitants have thrived as Turkey’s economic boom during the past decade brought rapid development to the Anatolian hinterlands. The Forum Mall, which opened last year, has a Popeyes, an Arby’s, a KFC, a McDonald’s, a Burger King, and a Starbucks. In October, “Fury,” with Brad Pitt, played at the cinema. I watched a red Lamborghini as it roared down a wide boulevard. For years, Turkey maintained cordial relations with Syria—the shared border is five hundred miles long—as part of a “zero problems with neighbors” policy. In 2008, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who was then Prime Minister, welcomed the vacationing Assad family at an Aegean resort. But not long after the Syrian uprising began, in 2011, Erdoğan declared, “It is not heroism to fight against your own people.” He urged Assad to step down, “for the welfare of your country, as well as the region.” Since then, Turkey has done more than any other nation to harbor Syria’s political and military opposition. Gaziantep is now home to the nascent Syrian Interim Government. Leaders of the Supreme Military Council and rebel commanders of the Free Syrian Army are regular visitors. The United Nations runs aid missions from Gaziantep, as do several other international organizations and a number of businesses. Gaziantep is particularly important to the United States. Washington closed its Embassy in Damascus in early 2012, and most American aid operations involving Syria are now directed from southern Turkey. The American effort includes three billion dollars in humanitarian assistance, such as food and medical aid, not only to refugees but also to Syrians inside the country. The United States has spent two hundred million dollars on everything from garbage trucks and ambulances to communications gear in order to prop up local councils struggling to provide essential services in rebel-held areas. An additional ninety million dollars has gone to equip armed opposition groups with nonlethal matériel, from trucks to ready-made meals. But there is no U.S. consulate, or even rented diplomatic office space, for American officials in Gaziantep, because of perceived dangers. For more than two years, Turkey allowed entry to thousands of foreigners, from dozens of countries, who ended up crossing the border to fight alongside the rebels. Young men disembarked at Gaziantep’s little airport and drove down the road to join the war. Some of them were Turks, including lawyers, students, merchants, even government employees. Earlier this year, though, after ISIS began attacking rebel groups and seizing Syrian territory that the rebels had liberated, the Turkish government clamped down; it claims to have deported a thousand would-be European jihadists and put six thousand others on a no-entry list. Even so, during the past two months, hundreds of men—and a few women—have reportedly crossed the frontier to join the jihadists. This summer, ISIS was widely believed to have penetrated Gaziantep. In October, police, in two separate raids in Gaziantep Province, seized twenty-nine suicide vests, three hundred and thirty pounds of C-4 explosives, grenades and other explosives, and Kalashnikovs. Americans in Gaziantep have been warned that ISIS operatives are tracking the activities of Westerners. U.S. officials remain in the city only a few days, or even a few hours, as they carry out their missions. A senior State Department official who was visiting the city told me that if he came under attack there his only option would be to hide under his hotel bed. This fall, U.S. officials came to Gaziantep to brief Americans working for nongovernment agencies. The advice was blunt: Keep a low profile. Don’t gather in groups in public places. Don’t wear sports or university insignia that would advertise nationality. Stay away from Starbucks. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }“Gaziantep is a workaday city, not a cosmopolitan place, even though it’s prosperous,” a young employee of an American contractor based there told me. “Now it’s been thrust into this weird world spotlight—as if Oklahoma City were suddenly on the front line of some international conflict.” One morning in late October, I drove from Gaziantep to the border overlooking Kobani, a Syrian town that ISIS has besieged since mid-September. Until then, the place was known mainly for its Ottoman-era train station, as a stop on the Berlin-Baghdad railway. Local lore claims that its name comes from the Germans who built the railway—from Kompanie, for “company,” or Bahn, for “train.” The town that grew around the station, of some forty thousand inhabitants, attracted Armenian Christians escaping genocide in the early nineteen-hundreds, and, later, ethnic Kurds. Kobani’s railway line became a boundary in the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, with which the British and the French secretly divvied up the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Eventually, Kobani was allocated to what would become the new state of Syria, and everything to the north went to Turkey. The borders on the map were arbitrary then, and ISIS is determined to destroy them now. By taking Kobani, it could extend its proclaimed Islamic Caliphate right up to the Turkish border. The siege of a once-obscure town didn’t attract much attention until the United States launched its first air strikes, in late September, transforming what had been a footnote in the war into a test of American might against the jihadist onslaught.  On a rocky hilltop on the Turkish side of the border, photographers, journalists, and Syrian refugees often gather to watch as Kurdish fighters battle ISIS for control of the town, a few hundred yards below. I sat next to Hamid Muslim, an eighty-four-year-old Syrian Kurd. His cane lay beside him. The air around us was noisy with the buzz of warplanes, spy planes, and drones, mostly American, punctuated by bursts of automatic rifle fire and mortar explosions. Hamid pointed with his cane toward the western part of Kobani, where he had lived and run a vegetable shop. “We closed the door and left everything behind,” he said. He had come to see what was still standing. Other refugees passed around an old pair of binoculars to check on their homes. Many were simple cinder-block buildings. The fighting, often house to house, even room to room, had caused vast destruction. The first U.S. air strike of the day hit just before noon. We could feel its impact up on the hill. A charcoal-colored cloud mushroomed over the town. Hamid wasn’t impressed. “It doesn’t seem like they’re really striking ISIS,” he said. “If they were, like this”—he picked up a large rock and pounded it repeatedly against a stone on the ground—“then ISIS wouldn’t be there anymore. They’re only hitting empty places—and not very often.” There were four other air strikes on Kobani that day, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, as the U.S. effort is officially known. A communiqué from Central Command said, “The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the terrorist group’s ability to project power and conduct operations.” The air strikes against Kobani—more than two hundred and ninety so far—have been costly: a Tomahawk cruise missile runs about $1.2 million, not including the fuel, crew, and deployment of two American warships in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea from which they are fired. U.S. warplanes have dropped munitions, including Hellfire missiles, at about a hundred thousand dollars apiece, and Small Diameter Bombs, at thirty thousand apiece. As for the warplanes, operating a B-1 bomber costs fifty-eight thousand dollars an hour. F-15E fighter bombers exceed thirty-nine thousand dollars an hour. And the new F-22 Raptor, used for the first time in combat against ISIS in Syria, costs three hundred and fifty million dollars—plus sixty-eight thousand dollars an hour in the air. Central Command reported that the five air strikes that day hit seven vehicles and one building occupied by ISIS. The air strikes were almost certainly hitting a lot of American matériel, too. ISIS’s artillery and tanks—worth hundreds of millions of dollars—were seized from the Iraqi Army, after four of its divisions disintegrated, in June. By mid-November, the ISIS blitzkrieg against Kobani had stalled. John Allen, the retired four-star Marine general who is the diplomatic head of the U.S.-led coalition of sixty nations, told Milliyet, a Turkish newspaper, that “the situation has largely stabilized” in Kobani, and that “ISIL will find that it is not going to be successful there.” Unlike the Iraqi Army, the Kurds had mostly vintage arms, but they refused to cut and run. ISIS suffered heavy casualties—reportedly more than six hundred fighters, with bodies left rotting on the ground for days. Its communications were also disrupted, its mobility restricted. A top State Department official predicted, “We’ll get rid of ISIL sooner than people expect.” Yet, as I could see from the hilltop, ISIS still held sections of the depopulated town. It outgunned the Kurdish militia. It adopted new tactics, too. With multimillion-dollar surveillance aircraft circling overhead, its fighters ignited piles of tires, spewing thick plumes of black smoke that obscured their movements. A black ISIS flag billowed in the wind atop a building in the heart of the town. “Syria is the most complicated war in the Middle East in the last one hundred years,” Anne Patterson, the Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Middle East policy, told me after she returned from Gaziantep. Later, in an e-mail, she added, “The Syria crisis defies simple solutions. But we have an obligation, based on our national-security interests in the region and as leaders of the international community with humanitarian obligations, to help bring it to an end.” The United States wants a friendly government in Syria. Although Syria has limited natural resources, it has long been at the Middle East’s strategic crossroads. Its borders—with Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel—give it leverage that Damascus has been able to exploit for political purposes. Syria’s ethnic and religious diversity also makes it vulnerable to exploitation by regional sectarian powers. An end to the war and a political transition in Damascus could have more of an impact in the Middle East than the ouster of Saddam Hussein or the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. “He’s a rescue.”Buy the print » “Syria, by itself, is not actually worth much,” Steven Cook, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. “But it’s been at the center of every strategic issue: the Arab-Israeli conflict; stability in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan; Iran’s influence; and Arab political unity.” He went on, “Since its own war started, Syria has become the vortex. The conflict has every pathology in the region—extremism, foreign fighters, proxy wars, great-power competition, sectarian violence. And now it’s sucking in everyone else on its borders.” Syria has been the most divisive foreign-policy issue within the Obama Administration. During the President’s first six years in office, he seemed determined to keep a low profile in the Middle East, fulfilling his campaign promises to end the U.S. occupation of Iraq and wind down the war in Afghanistan. In 2012, he resisted intense pressure from a powerful quartet—Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director David Petraeus, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey—to provide arms and training to Syrian rebels. Disagreements over policy grew so deep that two top Syria specialists at the State Department quit. “To me, it was obvious that that strategy wasn’t working,” Robert Ford, the most recent U.S. Ambassador to Syria, told me. He agreed to stay on through the acrimonious diplomatic talks in Geneva, last January and February, between Assad aides and the opposition. “But then I could no longer defend the policy. It was beginning to stain my personal integrity.”  As recently as August, the President was publicly skeptical of giving the rebels military assistance. With “respect to Syria,” he told the Times, the idea that arming the rebels would have made a crucial difference has “always been a fantasy. This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards.” Frederic C. Hof, a former State Department special adviser on Syria, who resigned in 2012, told me that “Obama has seen Syria as the problem from hell. There’s no magic bullet, and there is no fairy dust, so he has just wanted this problem to disappear from his in-box.” Obama had authorized humanitarian and nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition in the spring of 2012. Two dozen Americans are now part of the Syria Transition Assistance Response Team, or START. The program is operated primarily by teams rotating in and out of Gaziantep. A State Department official who has worked on aid programs in war zones and natural disasters told me, “This is the toughest assignment I’ve ever had. We’re trying to provide help to brave Syrians to keep their communities running, but we can’t go inside to make sure that it’s working. We’re doing our best in very dangerous circumstances, sometimes remotely.” More than two hundred thousand Syrians have been killed in the war. More than ten million—almost half the population—have fled the country or been forcibly displaced from their homes. More than half of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF. “The scale of the human tragedy in Syria is among the most brutal of any conflict since the end of the Second World War,” Raul Rosende, who is the deputy U.N. humanitarian-aid coördinator for Syria, told me. Turkey has taken in 1.6 million refugees, including three hundred thousand in Gaziantep; more cross the border every day. At the Arin Mirxan camp, near Kobani, I found more than three thousand people squeezed into four hundred gray tents. Kids, who were idling in dirt alleys, raced over to talk to me through the wire fence; there’s little else to do. It was one of four new camps within a few miles of one another, established since the assault on Kobani. At least three million Syrian children are no longer in school. “We fear this will be a lost generation, not only because they are not in school but because a lot of the new gangs will turn them into criminals or extremists,” Fawaz Mahmoud, the Syrian Interim Government’s deputy minister of education, told me. “It’s like the ground. Whatever you seed, you will grow. And the ground in Syria is horrible right now.” For aid workers, the risks are extreme. Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig, a former Army Ranger who had served in Iraq, returned to the region in 2012, as an emergency medical technician, to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon. In mid-2013, he moved his aid organization, SERA, or Special Emergency Response and Assistance, to Gaziantep. On October 1, 2013, he was abducted by ISIS after he drove an ambulance packed with medical supplies across the border en route to Deir Ezzor, in eastern Syria. He was beheaded by ISIS last month. Two other aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning, both British, were beheaded earlier in the fall. The lone American still reportedly held by ISIS, a woman, is also an aid worker. American aid has produced ethical dilemmas as well as risks. Aid earmarked for local councils had been going to four northern Syrian provinces—Raqqa, Deir Ezzor, Aleppo, and Idlib—where rebels had taken significant territory from Assad’s forces. This summer, however, ISIS seized much of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor. The losses sparked a debate in Washington, but the aid continued to flow in. “The questions have been: Are we enabling ISIS?” the senior State Department official told me. “Are we giving them sufficient aid that they can use their money to buy more guillotines? And would we starve people without food aid? It’s a tough conversation. It gives you a stomach ache.” Around ten or fifteen per cent of the three million Syrians living in ISIS territory are surviving on international aid, according to Orhan Mohamad, the executive director of the Assistance Coördination Unit, run by the opposition and headquartered in Gaziantep. “There is the humanitarian concept and the political concept—and they clash with each other,” he said. “If we send food baskets to this area, it helps ISIS politically. But if you judge it by humanitarian values it is keeping a family alive. So it’s guilty-guilty. It is the Devil’s choice.” The fate of U.S. humanitarian aid to the Syrian opposition mirrors the loss of American military equipment to ISIS. As the jihadists swept through northeastern Syria, they seized fire trucks, garbage trucks, ambulances, generators, water tanks, and rescue equipment that had been provided to local councils. The Islamic State’s takeover also put an end to U.S. stipends to pay for local schoolteachers. “We haven’t had a good day in a long time,” the senior State Department official said. Administering aid from Gaziantep complicates accountability. Last December, Islamist fighters (not aligned with ISIS) seized warehouses in Atmeh, just inside Syria, containing a million dollars’ worth of American supplies. Washington suspended nonlethal aid to the rebels for six weeks. It also dismissed the Supreme Military Council as its chief conduit of aid to the rebels and selected its own group of a dozen or so Free Syrian Army commanders to channel the matériel. One day, I drove to the nearest border crossing, at Kilis. The line of eighteen-wheel semis waiting to pass through the big steel gates was five miles long. Most Turkish truckers, once they get across, transfer their goods to Syrian drivers. And then, as one Turkish driver put it, “Who knows?” The American government requires multiple forms of verification that the goods reach their intended recipients—via G.P.S. devices, pictures from destinations, signed receipts, and third-party reports. But Mohamad estimated that only sixty to seventy per cent of international aid gets to intended recipients. The rest is lost to scams and schemes by warlords, gangs, criminals, truck drivers, and even the needy, who apply for aid from multiple groups and then set up little businesses to sell off the surplus. “A lot of aid is being sold, both in regime-controlled and opposition-controlled areas,” Assaad Al Achi, who works with the local coördination committees, told me. “You see it all the time on the streets in Idlib and Aleppo—canned food, flour, medical kits. Some still have logos from the World Food Program or Doctors Without Borders.” U.S. officials downplay the problems, emphasizing the scope of need. “That always happens—stuff leaks out, people sell it,” Patterson said. “Look, you make a decision to give humanitarian aid, and on the broadest possible scale, and that’s what we’ve done here, and we can debate that, but, fundamentally, that’s what has been decided—to give it to anyone who is hungry.”  “It’s a war,” the senior State Department official said. “If some of it leaks to other Syrians, it’s fine. I say, ‘Don’t overreact when something goes wrong.’ ” The premise of U.S. policy toward Syria is that the rebels need help in continuing to hold territory. The goal is to put sufficient pressure on Assad to eventually get him to meet the opposition at the negotiating table. “No one believes there is a military solution to this problem,” a senior Administration official told me. “We want to rebalance the situation on the ground. It’s not by making them”—the rebels—“militarily stronger, so that they can then march in and take over Damascus. We don’t believe that is how the story will end. We just want to insure that the regime can’t defeat the opposition.” One evening in Gaziantep, as I was having coffee in the Divan Hotel, a new high-rise, the lobby began to overflow with burly men, their bodyguards, and Turkish secret police. More than two dozen rebel commanders of the Free Syrian Army had shown up, unannounced. Some were in silk suits. A paunchy commander-cum-sheikh wore a religious robe. Another commander wore a sweatsuit and a white Adidas cap; he held an iPhone tightly in his hand. They were all from Aleppo, Syria’s largest city and commercial center before the war, and they had gathered for an emergency summit because of rising panic about Aleppo’s fate. “Kobani is just one little point of Syria, but Aleppo is the economic center,” Mohammed al Obeid, a captain in the Tawhid Brigade in Deir Ezzor, told me. “It’s sixty per cent of our revolution. If Aleppo is lost, it will be regarded as the biggest loss of the revolution.” The main threat to Aleppo is not from isis. Syria is the battlefield of two related conflicts. The first pits the Assad regime against rebels who emerged from a domestic popular uprising in 2011. The second pits the original rebels against extremist rivals, many of them non-Syrians, as in Kobani. As the world focussed on ISIS’s advances, the Assad regime escalated its offensive against opposition forces around Aleppo. In the past three years, Assad’s security forces have used most of the arms in their arsenal—missiles and chemical weapons, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, even gunboats off the coast. They have also been using barrel bombs: do-it-yourself devices, which cost little and are made from oil drums, gas cylinders, or water tanks. Barrel bombs can be filled with all kinds of material: shrapnel fashioned from metal scraps, or nails and nuts and bolts, with chemicals, like chlorine, and nitrate fertilizer as an explosive to deliver payload. They are usually dropped on civilian areas from helicopters. They terrorize those they don’t kill. “Can I start you all off with my cheesy alimony saga?”Buy the print » If Assad’s forces succeed in encircling Aleppo, cutting off access to the highway to Turkey, the city could be starved into submission, as has happened elsewhere. “Abandoning Aleppo would mean condemning Syria to years of violence,” the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post last month. “It would mean the death of any political future. It would mean exporting Syria’s chaos to its already vulnerable Iraqi, Lebanese and Jordanian neighbors. It would mean the breakup of the country to be delivered up to increasingly radicalized warlords.” One of the commanders at the emergency summit in Gaziantep was Sheikh Tawfiq Shahabuddin, who heads the Nureddin Zengi Movement, named for a legendary Syrian ruler during the Crusades. A big man with a beard, Shahabuddin wore a red-and-white kaffiyeh and fingered a set of dark-red prayer beads. “The situation is more dangerous than ever before in Aleppo,” he told me. “We want help from American airpower. We need them”—the U.S. and its allies—“to strike the strategic sites of the regime, not just ISIS. We asked Congress and nations in the coalition to create a no-fly zone.” He added, “Otherwise, our efforts are wasted.” The Free Syrian Army, which maintains a logistics office in Gaziantep, is not so much an army as it is an often dysfunctional umbrella for an array of militias, each with its own loyalties and commanders. The militias are named for martyrs of an area (the Idlib Martyrs’ Brigade), historic figures (Nureddin Zengi), religious tenets (Tawhid, or the Oneness of God), or political goals (Hazm, or Steadfastness). The F.S.A. was the largest alliance of Syrian rebels, but it has been eclipsed by more radical Islamist factions, such as Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic Front. More than a thousand militias, insurgent groups, warlords, and armed gangs are currently competing on the overlapping battlefronts. There’s been a lot of switching teams, too, depending on pay, local victories, and access to arms and ammunition. At their peak, the rebels numbered more than a hundred thousand fighters, but only thirty to fifty thousand were affiliated with the F.S.A. The rebels have a strategy only in principle, with little operational coördination from town to town, and scant weaponry to defend against Assad’s airpower. “Slowly, slowly, slowly, F.S.A. factions are being sucked into warlordism,” Achi, of the local coördination committees, said. “The main problem is that F.S.A. brigades were interested in liberating their village neighborhoods. But once they did that they sat and did nothing. They weren’t really interested in doing more.” He went on, “So groups, and even citizens, are becoming much more local about what is happening on their perimeter. Nationalism is completely dying. You’re going down to the smallest form of groupings. People now are going to their pre-civil-war identities—ethnic, sectarian, and so forth.” The F.S.A. is outnumbered by Assad’s security forces and outgunned by ISIS, which has about fifteen thousand fighters in Syria and the enormous benefit of the captured U.S. weaponry. Before the war, the Syrian Army had three hundred thousand men and women, but its roster has been severely depleted by those who have deserted, defected, or been killed. Assad now relies primarily on his core National Defense Forces, comprising more than fifty thousand personnel; his Air Force; paramilitary thugs, known as shabiha, or “apparitions”; and thousands of fighters from Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The Pentagon, in an effort to build up allies on the ground, announced plans in September to train a new force of five thousand fighters with more sophisticated arms and tactics. The force is supposed to grow to fifteen thousand during the next three years. But the men have to be thoroughly vetted, so the program is not likely to begin until next year. The C.I.A. has been running its own covert operation to train Syrian rebels, with support from Gulf countries. The United States has coöperated with Saudi Arabia to fund the training program, just as it did in the eighties to support the mujahideen anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan. The program has been personally brokered by the agency’s director, John Brennan, a former station chief in Riyadh, who speaks Arabic and has made several trips to the Gulf to negotiate details. A few hundred rebels have been trained to operate TOW anti-tank missiles. The C.I.A. is reportedly training four hundred fighters each month in secret camps in Jordan and Qatar. Small groups returning to Syria have had some success in the south, around Deraa, where the uprising against Assad began, and in sabotage attempts against the regime’s military. Haitham Afisi, the deputy chief of staff of the F.S.A., dismisses the new American efforts to aid the rebels. A colonel who defected after thirty years in Assad’s Air Force, he has met with several U.S. officials, including Senator John McCain. “It’s four or five months before they start, and then another four or five months to train,” he said. “The delay in the new force will allow the regime to advance. We face a real danger of losing the two provinces left, because now we are between ISIS and the regime, and they are gaining ground. So a lot of people will die. A lot of places will be destroyed. And there will be many more refugees this time.” He paused. “We have become just numbers—not people,” he said. “Numbers of dead.” Syria’s political opposition is also fragmented. The Syrian Opposition Coalition, which has more than a hundred members, sits in Istanbul, and is deeply divided, both politically and by regional sponsorship. (Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in particular, compete for influence.) Local-council activists accuse it of being out of touch with realities on the ground. The coalition, in turn, elects the Syrian Interim Government, whose Prime Minister and cabinet are headquartered in Gaziantep. This year, they moved into an elegant four-story building, with wraparound balconies, on a leafy boulevard. “It looks like the Embassy of Switzerland!” Bassam Al Kuwatli, a Canadian-Syrian who moved to Gaziantep to help the opposition, said to me. “They should be working out of containers, like they do on gas and oil fields, and not wearing ties. People come from inside Syria, people who hardly have any food, and see all that luxury. It’s costing them politically.” The interim government’s Prime Minister, Ahmad Tomeh, was first elected in September, 2013, and was dismissed, along with his cabinet, in July, 2014. He was reëlected in October, but only after Saudi-supported coalition members didn’t vote. The coalition also brokers the Prime Minister’s cabinet, which is currently a caretaker body and has involved nasty politicking among the factions. “Each party wanted a piece of it, so they’ve created a dysfunctional body,” Assaad Al Achi told me. “The minister of culture comes from a democratic background, and the minister of industry comes from the Muslim Brotherhood. They simply won’t talk to each other.” Tomeh is aligned with the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and with the Qataris, who gave sixty million dollars to keep the interim government functioning. In July, one of its senior officials absconded with ninety thousand dollars allocated for its justice ministry. “The Syrian opposition has failed, time and time again, to deliver a sustainable form of leadership,” Achi said. Prime Minister Tomeh, a former dentist and political prisoner, acknowledged as much when we met at his office. “We as the opposition have made our mistakes,” he said. “We have not yet been able to learn the culture and very concept of democracy. One of the major illnesses that hit us after fifty years of dictatorship is that we lost the spirit of teamwork.” I mentioned that people in his government are often criticized for sitting the war out in Gaziantep or Istanbul, rather than making their way back to Syria to govern in rebel-held areas. “Oh, definitely our wish is to be inside Syria, but the security circumstances are very harsh,” Tomeh said. “We are always saying to the international community, ‘Before you blame us about why we’re not in Syria, why don’t you help us create a safe zone?’ ” The opposition has long pressed for a no-fly zone, several miles deep, in northern Syria. The Obama Administration has so far rejected the idea. It would mean a major military operation against the Assad regime, which could be long and costly, even after clearing out radar, command-and-control centers, and forward military positions. (Enforcing the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq after the first Gulf War cost the United States billions and, even after several years, did nothing to help the Iraqi opposition topple Saddam Hussein.) The U.S. has refused to directly fund the interim government until it establishes a presence inside Syria. What concerns Washington is that no consensus opposition leader has yet emerged who can replace Assad. “Two generations of Assad rule have left Syrians without alternative leaders who can help guide them out of this terrible crisis,” a senior U.S. official told me. “There are no Nelson Mandelas, no Lech Walesas.” One Friday, the beginning of the Muslim weekend, I went to the Original Aleppo Restaurant, a favorite hangout of Syrian refugees in Gaziantep. The pillars are painted pink; the tables are red plastic and chipped. A photograph of Abdullah Faris, the owner’s young son, was hanging on the wall. He was killed by a missile in Aleppo in 2012, as he was talking by cell phone with his father. The restaurant was filled with men between their late teens and their mid-thirties. Some had fought in Syria; only a few were fighting now. “The revolution did a good job at first, but now everyone is fighting each other,” Ahmed, a nineteen-year-old barber from Aleppo, said. He wore a brown leather jacket. As he talked, others gathered around. They all had tales of how a rebel militia had disintegrated or been corrupted. Factories in opposition-controlled areas were raided, the goods taken to resell. Businessmen were extorted, effectively paying ransoms up front to avoid being taken hostage. “The F.S.A. has lost a lot of trust,” Ahmed said. “People who once supported it don’t even know who the real F.S.A. is anymore.” Many young Syrians who once took to the streets to protest Assad’s rule have lost the will to fight. The men complained that idealism was being replaced by disillusionment with profiteering warlords and petty politics. “The big problem in Aleppo is not weapons,” an opposition official who travels in and out of Syria from Gaziantep said. “For the first time, we don’t have enough fighters, because they’ve left or died, or we weren’t able to recruit. There are enough weapons to liberate the whole city. But there are not enough men.” I asked the men in the restaurant whom they now supported. “No one,” Ahmed replied. His friend Abdul Hamid Jamal, who had fought with the Tawhid Brigade in Aleppo, pulled up the sleeve of his hoodie and showed scars from where he’d been shot in the elbow. Now he’s among a growing number of part-time or occasional fighters. “A lot of people have lost at least one member of the family—they’re tired of the war,” he said, adding, “They’re less interested in fighting, because of the losses. That hurts the ability to fight either ISIS or the regime.” I asked Ahmed how long he thought he’d be in Turkey. “Maybe forever,” he said. "

At 106th Street and Columbus Avenue, the crowd’s chant slipped from “Jail killer cops!” to “Jail all cops!” and it felt, for a moment, as though its anger was becoming unmoored. The disparate groups of protesters on the streets of Manhattan on Wednesday night, amounting to hundreds, largely remained raucous but peaceful, however, as they protested a grand jury’s decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the N.Y.P.D. officer who, in July, placed Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold. Other groups of protesters assembled in Brooklyn and on Staten Island. According to the N.Y.P.D., eighty-three people had been arrested by Thursday morning. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } The grand-jury decision was announced just after 2 P.M. on Wednesday. Soon after, protesters gathered in Union Square, and, as evening approached, word spread on Twitter of a plan to interrupt the Christmas-tree lighting at Rockefeller Plaza. The police responded by setting up barriers along Sixth Avenue, between Forty-eighth Street and Fifty-third Street. They blocked pedestrian traffic at some intersections, and allowed through only those with tickets to the tree lighting. Elsewhere, though, it was difficult to distinguish the holiday visitors from the protesters and the usual Midtown commuters and theatregoers. At Fiftieth Street, just across from Radio City Music Hall, about fifty protesters gathered around an older man with a gray beard and glasses. “No more,” he shouted into a megaphone, pausing for the crowd to respond in kind. “Motherfucking business as usual!” Throughout the night, protesters used the People’s Mic, a call-and-response rhythm popularized by the Occupy Wall Street movement, in 2011. After a few rounds of the business-as-usual chant, a young blond woman yelled, “Mic check!” The crowd responded, “Mic check,” and waited to hear what she had to say. She started itemizing for whom they were there, and what they had gathered to protest. They were not only there for Garner and Michael Brown, whose assailant police officer was also not indicted in Ferguson, Missouri, she told them—and, echoing her, they told each other—but also for immigration reform. “Seems like we’re protesting for everything,” she yelled. As more people joined their circle, the group began to head west, on Fiftieth Street, and then turned north, up Seventh Avenue. “Eric Garner, Mike Brown, shut the whole system down,” some shouted, as what became closer to a hundred people walked around the cars trying to move south. Some drivers honked their horns in support of the march, and the pace of the group increased. Several rallying calls were shouted. “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” “Hey hey, ho ho, the racist cops have got to go!” “Black lives matter!” “Whose streets? Our streets!” Nearing Columbus Circle, I asked one protester if the group had a destination in mind. “I thought they were gonna turn down to Times Square,” he told me. “They might be going to Harlem. I know they did that before.” North of Columbus Circle, more police officers converged, but they didn’t stop the protesters. Many, it seemed, were simply watching. A few police cars drove alongside the protesters, who were now walking north on both sides of the median on Broadway, against traffic on one side and slowing cars on the other. When I asked officers what they thought about the protests, they all declined to comment. At Seventy-second Street, the crowd turned onto Amsterdam Avenue and continued north. “I just wanna go home,” a woman standing on the sidewalk said to no one. “I don’t wanna get shot by the fucking pigs,” a protester fired back. The crowd, now well into the hundreds, snaked east to Columbus Avenue, and then north again. Despite the protesters’ efforts to evade police blockades, the police were always waiting for them. At Eighty-sixth Street, the protest group came to a near stop when officers began telling people to move onto the sidewalks. A young woman who had walked between barricades yelled, “I’m an adult! I can move where I want!” “Act like one,” the cop retorted. The crowd, insistent on keeping north, headed for Central Park West, still shouting, “Whose streets? Our streets!” The marchers continued through the wealthy residential blocks of the Upper West Side and into the gentrifying streets of Harlem. With police cars at both the front and back of the crowd—and racing from west to east to anticipate its movement—it was no longer clear who was leading whom in this dance uptown. The crowd moved into poorer parts of Harlem, and past homeless people bundled up underneath the elevated train at 125th Street and Park Avenue. The block-and-a-half-long march turned east on 125th Street and came to a stop at Lexington Avenue, where dozens of protesters laid down in the intersection, performing a die-in. At around nine o’clock, nearly two hours after leaving midtown, the crowd began to move south on Lexington. But then it turned right on 119th Street, toward Park Avenue, and stopped at the N.Y.P.D.’s Twenty-fifth Precinct. On one side of the street, officers gazed out of their windows; on the other side, residents hung out of their windows, and some came down to join the crowd. A young man jumped on top of a car, waving a black flag that said, “Anti-Fascist Action.” Another man, talking into a megaphone, told the crowd about how, years ago, officers from this precinct beat up his stepson. The listeners booed. Soon, officers wearing riot helmets formed a line alongside the precinct building. Someone threw an opened water bottle at the officers, and it felt as though one side or the other might be on the verge of further provocation. The feeling didn’t last long, and the crowd moved on, westward, under an almost full moon.

The New Yorker,L,Can Chris Rock Make the Leap to Leading Man?,"

 

Rock sees his new film as a last chance. “If this doesn’t work, I can definitely see no one letting me direct a movie again,” he says. 
Credit Photograph by Pari Dukovic									 


In 1988, when Chris Rock had been doing standup comedy for four years, he took part in a special called “Comedy’s Dirtiest Dozen.” The producer’s idea was to gather together performers who were too shocking for the mainstream: Rock’s co-stars included Tim Allen, who hadn’t yet tamed his horny-Neanderthal act for television, and Bill Hicks, who presented antisocial rants as psychedelic parables. But even in this group Rock’s youth and acerbity and race made him stand out; the m.c. introduced him as “the Nat Turner of comedy.” Rock was a high-school dropout who had recently become one of Eddie Murphy’s protégés. After the two men met in a comedy club, Murphy gave him a six-hundred-dollar bit part in “Beverly Hills Cop II.” Rock strode onstage looking much younger than his twenty-three years: a bucktoothed kid with a multicolored leather jacket, a Jheri-curled flattop, and state-of-the-art Air Jordan III sneakers. “I was born a suspect,” he said, looking at the audience as if expecting a fight: Came out my mother’s stomach; anything that happened in a three-block radius, I was a suspect! White America is so scared of black teen-agers. I walk down the streets, women are grabbing hold of their Mace, everybody’s tucking in their chains, people are hitting their car doors, people get into karate stances. I look up in the air, there’s a bunch of old white ladies on the phone—they’ll dial nine-one and just wait for me to do something. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } His routine, barely six minutes long, was alternately rebellious and raunchy—the highlight was an absurd story about masturbating to the image on a box of Aunt Jemima pancake mix. Rock ended with an impudent gesture that any hip-hop fan would have recognized: he tossed the microphone onto the stage and walked off. That performance helped earn him a place in the cast of “Saturday Night Live,” two years later, and that attitude helped make him the defining comic of the hip-hop generation. “You can watch Eddie Murphy and go, This guy really loves R. & B. music,” Rock says. “You can watch Bill Cosby and it’s, like, This guy is jazz. If you watch me, it’s Ice Cube, Run-D.M.C.” Rock is forty-nine now, and in the years since that early routine he has upgraded his hair (natural, neat) and his teeth (whiter, straighter), while downgrading his sneakers—he likes cheap, plain black Chuck Taylors. Otherwise, he doesn’t look much different from the way he did back then. He has the same scrawny body and the same trebly voice, an infectious instrument that sounds even better when gently distorted, guitarlike, by a P.A. system. “The standup thing is a calling,” he says. Every few years, he works up a new hour of material, takes it on tour, and then turns it into an HBO special, which wipes the slate clean—according to a prevailing comedian’s code, every joke you tell on television is one you can no longer tell onstage. He uses the time between tours to work on other projects, and to give himself a chance to start missing the presence of a microphone and a crowd. “Part of me gets a little bored with standup sometimes,” he says. “It’s like any kid: you get really good at a video game—what’s the next game?” Buy the print » It was a Tuesday afternoon in Manhattan, and Rock had found his favorite table in the Mandarin Oriental’s Lobby Lounge, thirty-five floors above Central Park. He has been married since 1996 to Malaak Compton-Rock, a publicist turned philanthropist, and they have settled in New Jersey with their two daughters, who are never far from Rock’s mind. On this day, the older one had to get from school to volleyball practice, and the younger one, home sick after an asthma attack, called to prescribe herself a Frappuccino, which he agreed to procure. Rock had spent most of the morning at his office, a few blocks away, working on his other career, the one that keeps him busy between standup tours. Almost from the start, Rock supplemented his comedy jobs with acting work; one of his first major roles came in 1991, with “New Jack City,” in which he played Pookie, a crack addict whose craving was so strong that it made his whole body vibrate. (This was not a comic role, at least in theory.) He has often been called upon to help make other people’s movies funnier, but with his new film, “Top Five,” for which he served as both writer and director, he gave himself the kind of role he has never had: the leading man in a movie strong enough to finally convince his fans that he is no longer just a standup. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }The notion that there’s anything “just” about being a great comedian has irritated Rock for years. In 1997, talking with Eric Bogosian for the Times, he complained that standup was “the lowest medium in all of show business, in levels of respect.” No one ever suggests that a successful director branch out into standup comedy, so as not to be considered “just” a filmmaker. Still, Rock has never been satisfied with a life devoted purely to standup comedy, and “Top Five” is both an expression and a satire of the urge, common among professionally funny people, to be taken more seriously. Rock plays Andre Allen, a famous comedic actor trying in vain to create interest in his new film, “Uprize,” an earnest, misbegotten epic about the Haitian Revolution. One of Rock’s inspirations was “Stardust Memories,” the 1980 Woody Allen movie, in which Allen played Sandy Bates, a comic director who was sick of comedy. Early on, Rock has Andre repurpose Sandy Bates’s best-known line. “I don’t feel funny,” he moans, and he spends the rest of the movie—which unfolds in New York, in the course of a day—explaining himself to a Times reporter, played by Rosario Dawson, while simultaneously coming to his senses, or trying to. “Top Five” began quietly. Rock didn’t tell many people that he was writing it, and he shot it independent of any studio; the cast was augmented by comedians he considers to be friends, a group that evidently includes nearly all of them. The movie had its première at the Toronto International Film Festival, in September, where it inspired a standing ovation and, more important, an informal auction, which was won by Paramount. The studio reportedly paid twelve and a half million dollars for the rights to distribute “Top Five,” and promised to spend twenty million more promoting it, with some help from its star. In all this, Rock’s partner was the powerful producer Scott Rudin, who has become his motivator and protector. Rudin likes to think of “Top Five” as a risky bet that paid off. “This movie is a version of daring yourself,” he said one afternoon, during a meeting with Rock. “Because it’s not what has ever been your movie sweet spot.” Rock laughed. “I don’t really have a movie sweet spot,” he said. Rudin didn’t quite agree. Part of the problem, as he saw it, was that Rock had indeed carved out a role for himself in Hollywood, but a limited one. “Realistically, you’ve been in a lot of Adam Sandler movies,” he said. “You’ve been that guy, and there’s always a guy like that in the movie business, the reliable funny guy next to the guy at the center. But it’s not enough.” “No,” Rock said. “It’s not enough.” Rock wrote the script while on the set of one of those Adam Sandler movies, “Grown Ups 2,” the second installment of a somewhat lackadaisical and very profitable franchise. “I’m No. 3 on the call sheet: Sandler, Kevin James, and me,” he said, then reconsidered. “I might even have been four”—behind Salma Hayek, who played Sandler’s wife. “Which means I had so many days off.” He was staying in a rented waterfront house, which he turned into a one-man writer’s retreat. “I’m literally looking at the ocean, like fuckin’ Hemingway, writing longhand,” he said. Time spent on the set also gave Rock a chance to consider the successful career of Sandler, who has been one of his best friends since the nineteen-eighties, when they both worked at the Comic Strip, on the Upper East Side. “He had the confidence of a black wide receiver,” Rock said, admiringly. In the nineteen-nineties, “Adam Sandler movie” became not just a description but a genre, and an industry. “That’s something I needed to learn from him,” Rock said. “He does his movie amazingly. O.K., what’s a Chris Rock movie?” One of Rock’s many previous attempts to achieve film stardom was “Down to Earth,” a surprisingly wan 2001 reinterpretation of “Heaven Can Wait,” about an aspiring African-American comedian who dies and then returns to earth in the body of an old white millionaire. Near the end, when Rock’s character finally gets his racial identity back, he tests it out by trying and failing to hail a cab. “I’m black again!” he cries, exultant, as it speeds off. “I’m a black man! Thank God I’m a black man!” “We ought to send PBS some money so it can afford better pledge-break specials.”Buy the print » In one of the first scenes in “Top Five,” Rock updates and improves the joke. “Black man, trying to get a cab in New York City,” Andre says to Dawson’s character, extending his arm, hoping to enlighten her about the realities of race in America. Just then, the punch line arrives, in the form of a taxi skidding to a stop. Rock knows that his films, unlike his standup routines, haven’t generally met with rapturous enthusiasm, although some of them might be described as cult classics. “CB4” (1993), which he helped write and produce, was a low-budget hip-hop answer to “This Is Spinal Tap,” anchored by a series of loving pastiches. And “Pootie Tang,” a Rock production about a black superhero who speaks only in gibberish, became a kind of cultural touchstone partly because it was so energetically reviled upon its release, in 2001. (Pootie’s legend lives on in the hip-hop lyrics of Cam’ron, Big Sean, and Kanye West.) But the first two films that Rock directed were neither big hits nor brave misses. In 2003, he re-imagined “The Candidate” as “Head of State,” playing an ingenuous Everyman who finds himself running for President—one of the last “black President” fantasies to arrive before real life intervened. And in 2007 he remade the beloved French film “Chloe in the Afternoon” as “I Think I Love My Wife,” a rather sour romantic comedy. Often, he has taken smaller roles in other people’s movies, cast on the correct assumption that audiences will be happy to see and hear him, even if he doesn’t have a lot to do or say. As a standup, Rock is verbally brash but physically restrained—“People like to see me composed,” he says—and his stage movements are mainly limited to pacing, pointing, and squinting. In films, he can seem inert, as if, in the effort to shed his characteristic comic fervor, he has accidentally shed too much. As he wrote “Top Five,” Rock realized that he didn’t have to create an entirely new persona: he could become a memorable protagonist by rewriting his own life, following the example of Woody Allen, his hero, and also of Louis C.K., the comedian who plays a comedian in his acclaimed anti-sitcom, “Louie.” (He and Rock are friends and frequent collaborators. Louis C.K. wrote and directed “Pootie Tang” and co-wrote “I Think I Love My Wife.”) In “Top Five,” Rock plays not an Everyman but a celebrity, often surrounded by an ambient chorus of passersby shouting “Andre!” or, worse, “Hammy!,” the name of a crime-fighting bear that has become his signature character. Naturally, Andre Allen’s guarded skepticism fades in the presence of a beautiful and tenacious journalist. As the interview evolves into a date, and then into a disaster, Andre becomes increasingly expressive, and Rock is increasingly called upon to act. In the course of filming, Rudin engaged the services of Larry Moss, a prominent coach, to help Rock stop being a director—and, for that matter, a comedian—when he was on camera. “Sometimes when people think, they hold their breath,” Moss says. “And he’s a big thinker. So I kept saying, ‘Breathe, Chris. Don’t think. Stop and feel the floor.’ ” On set, whenever someone complimented Rock’s performance in a scene he responded with cheerful self-deprecation: “Just trying to stay in show business.” Unlike Andre Allen, Rock doesn’t have a signature character so popular that he never has to work again, although he does provide the voice of Marty, the zebra, in the three “Madagascar” films. He is a working comic who needs to keep working. “I’ve never made money like Eddie,” he said. “I’ve done fine, but it’s dribs and drabs: two here, one there. I never got, like, a thirty-million-dollar check. I never had a movie make three hundred million dollars that’s just starring me. So I don’t necessarily do it for the money—but I’ve never had so much money I don’t have to think about it.” He sometimes describes “Top Five” as his last chance to get it right. “It was, like, O.K., if this doesn’t work I can definitely see no one letting me direct a movie again,” he said. “I had to think that was a possibility. I mean, how many times can you not have a hit?” He searched for a suitable analogy. “I used to go see Christian Slater movies,” he said, shrugging. “They don’t really have them anymore.” During a couple of hours in the hotel lounge, Rock was approached only once, by a young girl, evidently a tourist, who ran near enough to confirm that it was really him and then retreated. But, when he descended to Sixtieth Street, his life became a bit more like Andre Allen’s. He had to get back to New Jersey, and there was no sign of the Uber car he’d ordered. “Uber fuckin’ does this shit,” he said, inspecting the map on his phone. There was a high school nearby, and teen-agers were streaming toward the subway. “Yo, Chris Rock!” one guy shouted. “Say a joke for me or something, man!” Buy the print » “Every day,” Rock muttered, without looking up from his phone. He approached a hotel doorman. “I’m going to Jersey,” he said. “Get me a car, I’ll give him a hundred bucks.” There were half a dozen idling town cars, but all of them already had assignments. “Motherfucker!” he said, to no one in particular. Finally, a yellow cab appeared, and after a brief negotiation—cabbies aren’t typically eager to cross the Hudson River—Rock got in and the taxi drove off. In 1993, after three undistinguished years on “Saturday Night Live,” Rock left and joined its black-oriented rival, “In Living Color,” which was cancelled not long after he arrived. By then, the cutting edge of black comedy had moved to HBO, which had created a popular showcase for emerging African-American comedians called “Def Comedy Jam.” The series was helping to make new stars, like Steve Harvey and Chris Tucker, and Rock felt left out. “I was, like, ‘These are the new black comedians, and I’m not a part of this shit? Fuck that.’ ” He got himself booked as a guest host, in the hope that, despite his years on “Saturday Night Live,” home of the white comedy élite, his young African-American fans would continue to think of him as their own. He still pays special attention to black audiences. Earlier this year, for instance, he hosted the BET Awards, a ceremony that is both less prestigious and, possibly as a consequence, more entertaining than the Oscars, which Rock hosted in 2005. “There’s not a lot of black stars without a black following,” he says. “You’ve got to have that bottom, or else you’re just rudderless.” Rock tends to shoot his comedy specials in front of predominantly black crowds, which gives him license to say things that might resonate differently in rooms full of white people. He recorded part of his début album at a black-owned comedy club in Atlanta, and one bit started with Rock looking around the room. “Lotta weaves,” he said. “What’s up with that shit?” There was an explosion of howling laughter—he scarcely needed to say more, though of course he did. A few years ago, he turned this observation into a wry documentary, “Good Hair,” about the art and science of caring for black women’s hair. During an episode of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” that featured the film, an African-American woman stood up to protest. “When other races see the movie, they’re going to laugh—but they’re laughing at us,” she said. “You’re telling everything about us. We just want to keep some secrets.” Rock’s defense was rooted in autobiography. He grew up in a working-class family in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the son of a New York Daily News delivery-truck driver, and from the age of seven he was bused to a school in Gerritsen Beach, a largely Irish-American and Italian-American neighborhood on the southern edge of Brooklyn. (“Ain’t nothing scarier than poor white people,” he once said.) He often talks about being bullied, an experience that taught him how to navigate a cultural divide, and also what a luxury it is not to have to. “All the art I do is mostly black,” he told the woman on “Oprah. ” “It’s for everybody, but it involves mostly black people, because I’m black. And Adam Sandler’s Jewish, and a lot of his stuff focusses on Jewish people.” He sounded slightly, and uncharacteristically, rattled. “I don’t have a television camera or a movie theatre that only shows to black people,” he said. “If I did, I would.” There have been times when Rock worried about being left behind. Not long after he departed “S.N.L.,” he was shown up one night in Chicago by his opening act, Martin Lawrence, whose extraordinarily expressive storytelling inspired an outsized reaction in an audience that was supposed to be there for Rock. (He told Vanity Fair, “It was like watching somebody fuck your wife with a bigger dick.”) The critic and filmmaker Nelson George, who has worked with Rock for decades, remembers that era as one of reinvention. Rock knew that he excelled at writing jokes, but he resolved to get better at telling them, so he built a rehearsal space in his Brooklyn carriage house, with mirrors on the walls, to practice his physical performance. “Everyone remarks on him stalking the stage,” George says. “That was a very conscious thing: ‘How do I create more energy?’ ” “Does flannel go with camo?”Buy the print » When Rock reëmerged, he had a bolder, more theatrical style, and jokes that more precisely captured his point of view, which is broad-minded but skeptical. (Years after that night in Chicago, Lawrence saw Rock perform in California and paid him a very specific compliment: “You got so many topics!”) Rock’s career began anew in 1996, with the release of a perfectly crafted hour-long HBO special called “Bring the Pain,” which includes perhaps the most startling riff in the history of American comedy. “There’s, like, a civil war going on with black people, and there’s two sides,” he said. “There’s black people. There’s niggas. And niggas have got to go. Every time black people want to have a good time, ign’ant-ass niggas fuck it up.” What followed was a profane indictment, perfectly balanced between comic frustration and tragic anger. “Niggas always want some credit for some shit they’re supposed to do,” Rock said: A nigga will say some shit like “I take care of my kids.” You’re supposed to, you dumb motherfucker! What are you talking about? What are you bragging about? Kinda ignorant shit is that? “I ain’t never been to jail!” What you want, a cookie? You’re not supposed to go to jail, you low-expectation-having motherfucker!  All this was palatable, if you found it palatable (and some didn’t), because Rock declined to present it as anything more than the splenetic observation of a guy who was a little older and a lot richer than he used to be—a guy, you suspected, who saw his relatives, and maybe even himself, reflected on both sides of that civil war. An intemperate rebuke about shiftless “niggas” sounded much more ambiguous, and much funnier, coming from the so-called Nat Turner of comedy. The “black people” vs. “niggas” routine established Rock not just as a great comedian, which is indisputable, but as a potential political spokesman, a role he has rejected ever since. “You’ve never seen me on a political show,” he says. “You’ve never seen me talk about an issue.” But he knows that part of what audiences love about him is his willingness to tell unpopular truths; where more confessional comedians reveal secrets about their lives, he aims to reveal secrets about ours. This means that his act requires a steady supply of unpopular truths to tell, and finding them can take a while. “You get to a point where it’s, like, I’ve said everything,” he says. “You want the world to change, and you want to change—you don’t want to be the same guy.” It has been six years since Rock’s last special, “Kill the Messenger,” and so, even while finishing “Top Five,” he has been making occasional forays to comedy clubs to work on his new set. On a recent Friday night, Rock turned up at the Comedy Cellar, in Greenwich Village, where Estee Adoram, the club’s longtime booker, is always happy to squeeze him into the schedule. Colin Quinn, a friend from the early days, was there, having just performed. “Good shit, man,” Rock said, and asked Quinn about his girlfriend. “You going to marry her?” “Aw, leave me alone,” Quinn said, fondly, before making an escape. Rock installed himself at a table marked “Reserved” in the restaurant, upstairs, and ordered some French fries, a Coke, and a chocolate milkshake. He had with him some sheets of cardboard—the remnants of notebooks whose pages had long ago been ripped out—covered with brief phrases. This is how he writes down his routines, using a technique borrowed from his paternal grandfather, who was a cabdriver during the week and a preacher on the weekends; the idea is to always be talking, instead of reading. He managed to eat a few fries before Adoram gave him a cue, and he hopped down a narrow staircase in the back just in time to hear the m.c. say his name, and to hear the audience react with stunned jubilation. “It’s not going to be that good—not at these prices,” he said, when he got to the low stage. (Admission was twenty-four dollars, plus a minimum of two items from the menu.) “At these prices, I could leave right now!” He imagined the reviews: “Chris Rock came out and he left—it was good! He didn’t tell any jokes, but it was good!” When Rock goes on tour, he is conscious of giving the audience a show: a sharp suit, a crisp set, a ferocious attitude. But on nights like this, when he is testing out material, he changes his body language in an attempt to create the conditions for a clinical trial: he wants to find out which jokes work even when he’s not selling them. He slumps against the back wall, fidgets with the microphone stand, pauses to examine his paperless notebooks. “It’s a gym,” he likes to say—a place to work out, not to show off. He looked out at the crowd, speaking mainly to himself: “What am I going to talk about?” January 31, 2011“What about Business—which branch is that?”Buy the print » There was plenty: a long bit about religion and a short one about bullying, and also a withering take on the alleged coolness of President Obama. “Obama’s, like, cool compared to other politicians—but not as cool as actual cool people,” he said. “Like, Miles Davis would kick Obama in the fuckin’ teeth!” Someone suggested that he say something about the new iPhone, but Rock preferred to consider Ray Rice and Chris Brown, two of the many celebrities who have been caught behaving badly in the years since Rock last toured. “People say there’s no reason to ever hit a woman,” he said. “No—there’s no reason to ever hit a woman first. You can hit a woman back—shit, if Oprah hit me I’d knock her the fuck out!” The absurd image gave the crowd permission to laugh at an idea that it didn’t necessarily endorse, and Rock pressed on, recalling the media coverage of Brown’s assault on Rihanna, who was then his girlfriend. “No one ever asked the question ‘Who hit first?’ ” he said. “Best journalists in the world, not one asked the question. ‘It’s not important.’ Yes, it is! It’s the most important question on earth.” The laughter was dying down. “The United States bombed fuckin’ Japan,” he said. “We killed so many people—like, twelve 9/11s on one day. Because they hit first,” he said. “We’re bombing up Syria—they cut off two people’s heads!” His voice was getting higher and more insistent—he sounded about seventy per cent earnest. “We’re going to kill hundreds of thousands of people! And it’s O.K.!” He got quiet, and the laughter returned, as the audience warmed to the punch line: “Because they hit first.” After about fifteen minutes onstage, he walked through the crowd and upstairs to his table, where a waiter brought back his half-eaten French fries and half-finished milkshake. “There’s no rich way to do standup,” he said. “You’ve got to go to the same club you started at, be around the same bunch of guys you knew twenty-five years ago. You’re going to go onstage, and they’re either going to laugh or they’re not. They’ll give you about six minutes because you’re famous. And then you’re back to square one.” As much as possible, Rock moves through the city as if he were not famous. “The average guy that’s been in as many movies as I have been in—and is black, or whatever—would have three people outside that door,” he said, one afternoon, after arriving unaccompanied for a meeting. “The driver downstairs would have a walkie-talkie, and they would correspond: ‘O.K., we’re moving him downstairs.’ No disrespect to anybody, but my heroes were different. Woody Allen doesn’t walk around with a bunch of random people, you know what I mean?” Rock doesn’t think of himself as unusually funny. “I’m not the funniest person I know,” he says. “I’m not the tenth-funniest person I know. I wasn’t the funniest guy on my block. I wasn’t the funniest guy in the clubs.” To compensate, he says, he had to outwork everyone else. “My nickname for him is the Duke of Doubt,” Nelson George says. “He’s not someone who revels in his successes. He’s already contemplating the next argument, the next thing that could go wrong.” For many people who knew Rock, his underwhelming film career was something of a running joke. George remembers that filmmaker friends of his used to say, “We love Chris, but he really shouldn’t direct anymore.” The comic and writer Neal Brennan, the co-creator of “Chappelle’s Show,” has known Rock for more than a decade, and served as a consultant on “Top Five.” He says that for years he was puzzled by the disjunction between Rock’s meticulously written standup sets and his seemingly tossed-off movies—everything he wrote, produced, or directed had been, essentially, a high-concept remake. “He likes being blue-collar: he likes that his dad was blue-collar, and he brought that blue-collar ethic to standup,” Brennan says. “But he never brought that blue-collar ethic to movies. This is the first time. And he did it—he’ll hate me for saying this—because Scott Rudin made him.” Rudin and Rock became close four years ago, after Rudin approached him with what sounded like a bad idea: to play a lead role in a new play called “The Motherfucker with the Hat,” by Stephen Adly Guirgis, which would make its début on Broadway. “It read like something he’d written,” Rudin says. “You read it, you couldn’t help hearing the words come from his mouth.” Rock’s character, Ralph, was a recovering alcoholic, a seeming beacon of good sense who slowly reveals himself to be a cold-blooded opportunist. The director, Anna D. Shapiro, hesitated to cast Rock, but was worn down first by Rudin’s enthusiasm and then by Rock’s willingness to audition, and by his commitment to developing a different kind of stage presence. “Chris is used to making eye contact with the audience,” Shapiro says. “The audience shifts and changes, and he rides that.” In rehearsal, she sometimes had to admonish him for looking at her—he needed to learn to resist his habit of reading the room. June 23, 2008“You may approach the giant novelty chair.”Buy the print » It was a difficult production—Guirgis kept rewriting all the way through the previews—but the critical notice, during the play’s four-month run, was mainly kind. For Rock, the experience was transformative: he was impressed by Guirgis’s ability to write new lines every day, and by his own ability to learn them and then deliver them only a few hours later. (As a standup, Rock typically doesn’t say anything in a theatre that he hasn’t already said, hundreds of times, in a small club.) The play helped him realize that a dramatic project could be as difficult, and as rewarding, as standup. “I think when Chris came to do ‘Motherfucker’ he was sleepwalking, a little bit, in his life,” Shapiro says. By the time the play was finished, Rock was ready to work just as hard on a film.  Rudin says, “I’d always thought Chris was a good director. I didn’t always agree with the choice of material.” For “Top Five,” he urged Rock to present himself as a star. “Don’t make yourself a nerdy guy in glasses,” he said. (In “I Think I Love My Wife,” Rock played the investment banker Richard Cooper—a nerdy guy in glasses.) Rudin’s hope was to recapture the rebellious spirit of Rock’s early standup routines. He said, “What can we do that’s as fuck-off as who you were then? What’s the forty-nine-year-old version of dropping the mike?” In “Top Five,” as in the previous movies Rock has directed, his character is choosing between two women: a thoughtful journalist, played by Dawson, and a reality star, played by Gabrielle Union. It is in some ways a kindhearted story, but Union’s character—glamorous and unsentimental—could be the subject of one of Rock’s less sparing routines about women. “I don’t have a talent,” Union laments, at one point, and it’s not entirely clear whether we’re meant to pity her, laugh at her, or both. Near the end of “Top Five,” Andre Allen makes his way to the Comedy Cellar, and the character and the actor become indistinguishable. Rock used to save his best jokes for his standup—in “Down to Earth,” he played a struggling comedian whose material, unfortunately, made his situation seem quite believable. He says, “This is the first movie I just said, ‘Fuck it—I’ll write other standup jokes.’ ” Shapiro, the theatre director, saw an early draft, and she remembers Rock asking if she had any suggestions. “I said, ‘Yeah, can you take out the stupid jokes about gay people? Or the stupid jokes about fat people?’ And he was, like, ‘No—but I’ll take a look at them.’ ” The jokes stayed in, and at a recent preview screening they earned roaring responses. One Friday morning, in the modest theatre-district offices that house Rudin’s production company, the two partners were preparing for a conference call with the marketing department of Paramount. The night before, at a thirtieth-anniversary concert for Def Jam, the hip-hop record label, in Brooklyn, Gabrielle Union had introduced the début screening of the film’s trailer. “She got the title of the movie wrong,” Rudin said, chuckling—she had called it “Top Ten.” Like many producers, he is typically disinclined to receive bad news calmly, but on this day he seemed more like a cheerful fan, happy to share a couch with his favorite comedian. “She was great, though,” Rudin said. “She was really charming.” Rock looked up. “You went?” He liked the image of Rudin in Brooklyn, watching 2 Chainz. A decade or two ago, Rock surely would have been there, instead of spending another quiet night at home in New Jersey. “I got video,” Rudin said, regretfully. “I had tickets—I couldn’t get out of here. ” Rudin was reprising the role of motivator. “I think he has to go back and make another movie,” he said. “Not in four years—another movie should be out in two years, two and a half years.” Rudin even made the impending marketing call sound like proof of Rock’s arrival as a legitimate movie star. “He’s going to walk into this room, there’s going to be forty people on the other end of this teleconference that are all there for him,” Rudin said, and then he looked at Rock. “That’s a big moment in your life,” he said. “They’re here for you. You’re not part of someone else’s movie. This is your thing.” Rock laughed. “I’m Sandler!” “Exactly!” Rudin said. September 24, 2012“Wait! Everything’s going to be okay—they’re having an election!”Buy the print » Rock is closer in spirit to Woody Allen, whom he once called the greatest comic mind since Chaplin. But what he discovered was that he could make an Allen-inspired movie—small, self-conscious, profoundly New Yorkish—without muting his other interests. “In a weird way, this is the blackest movie I’ve ever done,” he says. “It’s really black. It’s blue-black.” One extended scene, set in an apartment in the projects, is essentially an excuse to fill a room with African-American comedians, including Tracy Morgan, whose patter contains an unfootnoted allusion to a speech that Suge Knight delivered at the 1995 Source Awards. The film refuses to stop and explain its many hip-hop references. (The title refers to the characters’ habit of asking one another to name their favorite rappers.) During that convivial apartment scene, Andre swaps jokes and pronouncements with old friends and relatives, speculating about what Tupac Shakur would be up to if he were still alive. When someone says that Shakur would be a political leader, Andre turns skeptical. “Tupac might be in a Tyler Perry movie right now—you don’t know!” he says. “Tupac might be the bad, dark-skinned boyfriend in a Tyler Perry movie. I would hope he’s a senator. But he might be kicking Jill Scott down a flight of stairs.” In another scene, Andre sums up the movie’s split personality by granting Charlie Chaplin an honorary place in his hip-hop pantheon, calling him “the KRS-One of comedy.” Louis C.K. thinks that the solution to Rock’s movie problem was obvious in retrospect. “His honesty and thoughtfulness and intelligence—it isn’t a good match for just putting a guy up there, building a big premise around him, and raking in the bucks,” he says. “Chris was trying to figure out the formula to make a movie, but all he really needed to do was be who he is onstage.” By writing a movie inspired by his own life, Rock found a way to put his disparate obsessions onscreen, depicting a world in which Woody Allen is no less or more important than Tupac Shakur. Rudin describes “Top Five” as “half a Richard Linklater movie and half a Robin Harris concert film,” though he surely hopes that it will appeal to viewers who have never seen “Waking Life,” or who have never heard of Harris, a stubbornly non-mainstream black comedian, who died in 1990. The movie succeeds as a hybrid, both moodier and bawdier than anything else Rock has done onscreen. Rock said, “Even if the movie doesn’t make a dime, I’ve figured out the tone of movie I should be in.” In fact, Rock is already thinking about the next movie that he wants to direct, although it has less in common with “Top Five” than with “Uprize,” Andre’s disastrous movie-within-a-movie about the Haitian Revolution. Rock has been reading about Nat Turner, and he believes the time might be right for a bio-pic that tells Turner’s story in all its complexity. “Nat Turner’s a fucking nerd,” Rock said, with admiration. “He gets taught to read and write by his white massa, and he gets sold, and now he has to go out in the fields like everybody else, and he’s so not equipped for this shit.” He liked the idea of Turner as a snob who became a revolutionary only after getting the snobbery beat out of him. “Nat Turner had the worst attitude,” he said. “He was worse than the white guys! Then he gets put out there. It’s, like, ‘Oh, shit! Everything I’ve been taught is bullshit!’ And he organizes guys and has this bloody fuckin’ takeover.” Rock had an onstage gleam in his eyes. “I’d love to do that movie,” he said. "

Hans Ulrich Obrist has conducted twenty-four hundred hours of interviews with creative people: “salons of the twenty-first century.”

Hans Ulrich Obrist is a curator at the Serpentine, a gallery in London’s Kensington Gardens that was once a teahouse and is now firmly established as a center for contemporary art. A few years ago, ArtReview named him the most powerful figure in the field, but Obrist, a forty-six-year-old Swiss, seems less to stand atop the art world than to race around, up, over, and through it. On weekdays, he works at the Serpentine offices; there are meetings over budgets and fund-raising, and Obrist, with his fellow-director, Julia Peyton-Jones, selects artists to exhibit and helps them shape their shows. When I visited him in London in late August, two exhibitions that he had organized were up: “512 hours,” a “durational performance” piece by Marina Abramović, and a show of computer-generated video art by Ed Atkins. But on weekends Obrist becomes who he truly is: a traveller. By his count, he has made roughly two thousand trips in the past twenty years, and while in London I discovered that he had been away fifty of the previous fifty-two weekends. He goes to meet emerging artists and check in with old ones, to see shows small and large. The kind of culture he cares about is mobile and far-flung and can be grasped better on the move. He likes to quote J. G. Ballard’s claim that the most beautiful building in London is the Hilton Hotel at Heathrow Airport, and the postcolonial scholar Homi Bhabha’s observation that “in-betweenness is a fundamental condition of our times.” Obrist is enormously fond of quoting. On the twelve weekends before I saw him in London, H.U.O., as Obrist is known, had been in Basel, for the art fair; Ronchamp, France, for a wedding, in the chapel designed by Le Corbusier; Munich, for a talk with Matthew Barney; Berlin, where he maintains an apartment primarily to house ten thousand books, for an interview with Rosemarie Trockel; Frankfurt, for a panel with Peter Fischli; Arles, where he is helping to design a new museum; Singapore, to meet emerging artists; Munich again, to interview the young Estonian artist Katja Novitskova; Los Angeles, for a panel on art and Instagram; Vienna, to guest-curate an exhibit of unrealized design projects; Majorca, to see Miquel Barceló’s ceramic murals in the cathedral; Edinburgh, where Obrist’s new memoir, “Ways of Curating,” was featured at the book fair; and Vancouver, where he appeared onstage with the novelist and futurist Douglas Coupland. In all these locales, he saw as much art as he could, but he also visited scientists and historians. He believes that, because culture is becoming more interconnected across geography and across disciplines, his knowledge must expand far beyond the visual arts: to technology, literature, anthropology, cultural criticism, philosophy. These disciplines, in turn, become tools in Obrist’s attempt to fertilize the arts with fresh ideas.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } Another thing that Obrist loves to do is talk. His favorite word is “urgent,” to which he gives an elongated Mitteleuropean pronunciation. His words come out in an almost comical torrent, citations bobbing up and ideas colliding. Again quoting Ballard, he describes his curatorial work as “junction-making”—between objects, between people, and between people and objects. Words help Obrist process what he’s seeing, and he often channels this energy into interviews with artists and cultural figures, which he calls “salons of the twenty-first century.” He has conducted twenty-four hundred hours of interviews to date, talking to artists in their studios, on planes, or as they walk. Ideally, he records them using three digital recorders, to make sure that nothing gets lost. “Wow! It’s beginning to look a lot like Xmas.”Buy the print » In interviews, Obrist’s volubility is paired with a deep deference. The architect Rem Koolhaas, in a preface to the Obrist compendium “dontstopdontstopdontstop,” writes, “Usually those afflicted with logorrhea do not stimulate others to communicate; in his case, he rushes to let others do the talking.” Obrist respects the art-world compact that though the work may be shocking, the conversation should be supportive. His questions are rarely personal, and when he is being interviewed himself he is similarly guarded: at one point, when I asked him to explain his manic personality, he said, “Maybe I’m in a permanent state of Pessoa’s intranquillity.” The interviews, over time, become books. He has published forty volumes of them, records of interactions with everyone from Doris Lessing to the video artist Ryan Trecartin. In all, they represent Obrist’s best claim to being an artist in his own right. He likes to say that he models himself on the impresario Sergei Diaghilev. Obrist is not interested in all art equally. He can be skeptical about painting, because at this point, he told me, it’s difficult to do meaningful work in that medium. For him, art, even old art, must be speaking to something current. “I don’t wake up in the morning and think about Franz Kline,” he said. The art he is most passionate about doesn’t hang on walls and often doesn’t have a permanent emanation. It can take the form of a dance or a game or a science experiment, and often leaves nothing behind but memories and an exhibition catalogue. (Obrist has published more than two hundred catalogues.) He looks for work that responds to the current moment or anticipates the moment after this one—Obrist is obsessed with the not-yet-done. His favorite question is “Do you have any unfinished or unrealized projects?” if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }Much of the work that fits Obrist’s ephemeral aesthetic could be called relational art, a term coined by the Parisian curator Nicolas Bourriaud in the nineteen-nineties to describe work whose content cannot be separated from its communal reception. (Obrist avoids using the term “relational” himself, in part because the artists never used it.) Abramović’s “512 hours” is a good example of relational art. There were few props, no script, and no installation; patrons were asked simply to join Abramović in an unadorned gallery space and conjoin their psychic energy. Another example of Obrist’s taste is a work by Olafur Eliasson, the Danish-Icelandic artist, whom Obrist helped discover. Obrist was one of a team of curators who invited Eliasson to contribute to a multi-authored opera called “Il Tempo del Postino,” first staged at the Manchester International Festival, in 2007. Eliasson created a piece, “Echo House,” in which a reflective curtain dropped in front of the audience, showing audience members their every gesture. Each sound they made—from coughs to claps—was mimicked sonically by the orchestra. Soon the audience took the lead, improvising a score of shouts and ring tones. These works feel modern, in part, because they mirror the group decision-making found online; at the same time, they foster interactivity without leaving people isolated in front of screens. The Internet is always on Obrist’s mind, as he scans for signs of cultural shifts. Although his shows often playfully elevate the non-artistic to the curatorial—Duchamp is a key figure—they also have a sadness to them. He clearly believes that art offers a refuge at a time when dark beasts, from capitalism to climate change, roam the earth. His friend the artist Liam Gillick sees Obrist’s taste in art as made up in equal measure of “the melancholic sublime and the idea of the productive machine.” Obrist, for his part, notes that his exhibits often demonstrate what he has called a “quality of unfinishedness and incompleteness.” He doesn’t like art to have temporal, spatial, or intellectual limits. The white cube of the gallery irks him; closing dates bother him. He prefers to think of exhibitions as seeds that can grow. For one of Obrist’s early shows, “do it,” which débuted in Klagenfurt, Austria, in 1994, twelve artists created “instructions” rather than finished work. Alison Knowles, a New York artist associated with the Fluxus movement, invited visitors to bring something red and fill one of dozens of squares in the gallery space with it. The exhibition never looked the same from day to day. Other venues soon took it on, and, over the years, artists have dropped in and the instructions have changed. The exhibition, which just celebrated its twentieth anniversary, is one of the most widely produced art shows in the world. “Do it” is the signature effort of a curator who has followed his own algorithm: see art, meet the artists, produce their shows, use these shows to meet more artists, produce their shows in turn. (In “Ways of Curating,” Obrist calls social interactions “the lifeblood of any curator’s metabolism.”) “Can’t Yelp rate dry cleaners in order of how good they keep their mouth shut?”Buy the print » Every year, the Serpentine holds a Marathon—a festival that coalesces what Obrist has learned from his travels and his reading and his interviewing. It is a combination of exhibitions, performances, and panels, with writers, visual artists, and cultural historians mixed in freely. The first Marathon, in 2006, was a twenty-four-hour rolling interview session that Obrist co-hosted with Koolhaas. Afterward, Obrist was so exhausted that he had to check himself into the hospital. Koolhaas, who was then sixty-one, did not. “He was better trained, because he did a lot of sports,” Obrist remembered. (Obrist now jogs every morning in Hyde Park.) Last year’s Marathon, which Obrist conceived with the French curator Simon Castets, was called “89plus,” and focussed on people born that year or later. Obrist explained, “1989 was the year the Berlin Wall came down, and it was the year Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. This is the first generation to live its life entirely on the Internet.” Ryan Trecartin and some sixty others participated. Of course, two days were not enough to explore such a subject, and in Obrist’s mind the exhibit never really ended. He and Castets are now planning an “89plus” event, dedicated to poetry, in Stockholm next year. In October, Obrist travelled to New York, and while he was there he held a planning meeting about “89plus” at a café in Greenwich Village. Surrounded by young poets and editors of alternative presses, he asked, “Do you know any poets who use Snapchat?” His voice was full of hope—what poetry could be more to Obrist’s liking than poetry that vanishes? Afterward, we toured art galleries. Obrist was in and out remarkably quickly, like a man with a plane to catch. If a gallery representative took more than twenty seconds to explain a work, Obrist turned his attention to his iPhone. Though he likes to learn, he doesn’t like to be told what to pay attention to. But when he saw something he really liked he paused, and a light smile crossed his lips. This happened at the New Museum, which had on display the Lebanese artist Etel Adnan’s quietly bold abstract landscape paintings, along with a typescript of her book-length poem “The Arab Apocalypse.” He said, “This has something of the Gesamtkunstwerk”—a complete, or all-encompassing, art work. The term is often associated with the sprawling operas of Richard Wagner, but for Obrist it can be something much more nimble—a protean creation that is remade over time, absorbing fresh influences from people who engage with it. Something, in other words, much like himself. Obrist was born in Zurich and grew up in a small town near Lake Constance. His father was a comptroller in the construction industry, his mother a grade-school teacher. An only child, he found school “too slow,” and other Swiss found his vitality off-putting. “People would always say that I should go to Germany,” he remembered. His parents were not particularly interested in art, but on several occasions they took him to a monastery library in the nearby city of St. Gallen. He admired the antiquity of the books, the silence, the felt shoes. “You could make an appointment and, with white cloths, touch the books,” he said. “That’s one of my deepest childhood memories.” “It’s your turn. I’ve run out of pleasantries for the gauntlet.”Buy the print » When he was around twelve, he took the train to Zurich, where he fell in love with “the long thin figures” at a Giacometti exhibition. Soon he was collecting postcards of famous paintings—“my musée imaginaire,” he calls it. “I would organize them according to criteria: by period, by style, by color.” One day, when he was seventeen, he went to see a show by the artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss at a Basel museum. He was engrossed by their “Equilibrium” sculptures—delicately balanced metal-and-rubber constructions. He had been reading Vasari’s biographical sketches of the artists of the Renaissance, and it struck Obrist that he could try to meet creators, too. He reached out to Fischli and Weiss with this rap: “I’m a high-school pupil and I’m really, really obsessed by your work and I’d love to visit you.” He told me, “I really didn’t know what I wanted. It was just this desire to find out more.” Fischli and Weiss were amused by the precocious Obrist, and welcomed him to their Zurich studio. They were filming their now famous short film “The Way Things Go,” in which an old tire rolls down a ramp, knocking over a ladder and setting off a chain reaction. On his visit, Obrist discovered a sheet of brown wrapping paper on the floor with the entire Rube Goldberg schema drawn on it. “It was almost like a mind map,” he said. Soon afterward, Obrist was entranced by a Gerhard Richter exhibition in Bern, and asked Richter if he could visit his studio, in Cologne. “That took courage,” he said. He travelled on the night train from Zurich. “When I arrived, he was working on one of his amazing cycles of abstract paintings,” Obrist said. They talked for ninety minutes. Richter was astonished by Obrist’s passion: “ ‘Possessed’ is the word for Hans Ulrich,” he told me. Richter recommended the music of John Cage. “We discussed chance in paintings and he said he liked playing boules,” Obrist recalled. A few months later, Obrist was in a Cologne park, playing boules with Richter and his friends. Obrist doggedly arranged to meet other artists whose work he admired. He went to see Alighiero Boetti in Rome. The feverish Boetti may be the only person ever to complain that Obrist didn’t talk fast enough. (In his new book, Obrist writes with delight, “Here was someone with whom I had to struggle to keep up.”) When Obrist asked him how he could be “useful to art,” Boetti pointed out the obvious: that he was born to be a curator. Obrist wasn’t sure what the job entailed, but he was intuitively drawn to the power of organizing art. As a teen-ager, he visited an exhibition at the Kunsthaus in Zurich: “Der Hang zum Gesamtkunstwerk,” or “Tendency Toward the Total Work of Art.” It highlighted four selections from the past hundred years of modernism: Duchamp’s enigmatic glass construction “The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even,” and one painting each by Kandinsky, Mondrian, and Malevich. The works had been placed at the center of the Kunsthaus, heightening their effect. Obrist was struck by the intelligence of the man who had organized it: Harald Szeemann. Also a Swiss, Szeemann was one of several curators who had begun to bring a new inventiveness to the age-old job of selecting art to illustrate a theme. Obrist saw the show forty-one times. (Later, of course, he interviewed Szeemann.) Obrist did not yet feel qualified to put his stamp on the art world. He had the autodidact’s anxiety about not knowing enough. For all his energy, he was not a revolutionary; he was an accumulator of information. But how to find out what artists were doing? “There wasn’t then a place to study,” he said. “I knew of no curator schools.” So he designed his own education. He enrolled at the University of St. Gallen, and majored in economics and social sciences. When not in class, he set out to see as many shows as he could. Switzerland is well situated if you want to make impulsive trips around Europe. Obrist spoke five languages: German, French, Italian, Spanish, and English. (His English was given a boost by Roget’s Thesaurus, and he still keeps a vocabulary list in a blue notebook that he takes with him—among the latest words are “forage” and “hue.”) He took the night train to avoid hotel bills and arrived in a city the next morning. “I would go to every museum and look and look again,” he remembered. Then he visited local artists. He found that he could improve his welcome if he brought news of what he had seen, plus other artists’ gossip and opinions. “I would go from one city to the next, inspired by the monks in the Middle Ages, who would carry knowledge from one monastery to the next monastery,” he said. At Boetti’s suggestion, he also inquired about unrealized projects, as every artist had some and felt passionate about them. Above all, he listened. “I was what the French call être à l’écoute,” he told me. His youthful intensity sometimes raised concern. Louise Bourgeois, after meeting the teen-age Hans Ulrich, sleep-deprived and suffering from a cold, called his mother in Switzerland and urged her to take better care of her son. “Are you still using that outlet?”Buy the print » In 1991, Obrist, in his early twenties, finally felt ready. By then, he estimates, he had visited tens of thousands of exhibitions and knew more artists than most professional curators. He chose to hold his first show in the kitchen of his student apartment. “The kitchen was just another place I kept stacks of books and papers,” he recalled. The minimalist gesture seemed appropriate, both as a reaction to the engorged art market of the eighties and as a reflection of the economic slump across Europe. It was also a playful homage: Harald Szeemann had done an exhibit in an apartment. The idea of the show was to suggest that the most ordinary spaces of human life, cleverly curated, could be made special. Among the friends he included was the French painter and sculptor Christian Boltanski. Under the sink, Boltanski projected a film of a lit candle; the flickering could be seen through the gap in the cabinet doors. “It was like a little miracle where you expect it least,” Obrist remembered. He publicized the exhibit through small cards and word of mouth; still, he was relieved that only thirty people came over the three months it was open. “I was still studying and couldn’t have coped with much more,” he said. Among those attending was a curator from the Cartier Foundation, a contemporary-art museum in Paris. Soon afterward, Cartier offered Obrist a three-month fellowship. Obrist took it, leaving Switzerland for good. Obrist quickly became a figure on the European art circuit. He was a clearing house for news and relationships, and he was generous—no sooner had he met someone than he helped that person connect with others in his widening circle. If he stayed in a hotel, he cleaned out the postcards in the lobby and mailed them to everyone he could think of. “He had these big plastic bags,” Marina Abramović, who met him in Hamburg in 1993, recalled. “I always wanted him to empty them and list all that was inside. . . . He would have information of every single human being—every artist living in a favela!” She remembered him as astonishingly innocent, an adjective that many still use for him. Many artists saw his unchecked commitment as a counterpart to their own. The French artist Philippe Parreno said, “For me, there is no difference between talking to him and talking to other artists. I am engaged at the same level.” Obrist once conducted an interview with Parreno while driving him from the Dublin airport to Connemara, and became so deeply absorbed that he didn’t realize he was on the wrong side of the street. Obrist continued to set up shows in unusual locations. He put on an exhibit of Richter’s paintings in the country house where Nietzsche wrote part of “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” and a show in a hotel restaurant where Robert Walser, the Swiss writer, used to stop during long walks through the mountains. A third took place in Room 763 at the Hotel Carlton Palace, in Paris, where Obrist was then staying. In one part of the exhibit, called “The Armoire Show,” nine artists created clothes for the closet. With Fischli and Weiss, he toured the Zurich sewer museum. “They had toilets and urinals on plinths and had never heard of Duchamp,” he marvelled. This inspired him to put together “Cloaca Maxima,” which featured art about lavatories and digestion. The show opened in 1994, in and around the Zurich sewers. During much of the nineties, Obrist held a part-time position at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. He was the museum’s “head of Migratory Curation”—a whimsical title that was, essentially, an invitation to travel and find new talent. In 1995, Julia Peyton-Jones, the director of the Serpentine, invited Obrist to put on a show there. He proposed an exhibition called “Take Me (I’m Yours),” in which visitors were asked to leave with an object from the exhibit. It was a huge success, and many felt that Obrist had subverted the passive expectations of a museum visit: fill up on culture and leave. He had injected a note of interactivity into staid Britain. (Frieze was less impressed: “The viewers’ participation is rewarded with some worthless gesture or rubbish souvenir.”) Buy the print » While working on the Serpentine show, Obrist rented a three-bedroom flat on Crampton Street in Elephant and Castle, then a marginal neighborhood. He had fifty copies of his house keys made and handed them out to artists and curators passing through London. Conversations with his guests often lasted through the night; then, at six in the morning, Obrist went with whoever was still awake to a nearby McDonald’s—the only place around that was open at that hour. Klaus Biesenbach, who is now the director of moma PS 1, in Queens, stayed with Obrist for a time. One day, Biesenbach told me, a Korean artist named Koo Jeong-A arrived. Koo, then in her mid-twenties, made delicate installations: heaps of domestic dust, an arrangement of leaves, piles of coins. Her work was ephemeral, and she hated to be interviewed. Obrist had shown some of her efforts in Paris and had invited her to set up an installation in the Crampton Street flat. In the morning, the three would meet for discussions, Biesenbach recalled. “And one morning, I remember, they came out of one room. Wow, I thought, they must have had a meeting before. Why didn’t they invite me to the meeting? And the next morning they came again out of the room.” Obrist and Koo have been together ever since. The sharp-tongued English press continued to poke at Obrist. Adrian Searle, an art critic for the Guardian, wrote in 1999 that he often found Obrist’s curating “deeply irritating.” But Obrist’s coterie is less reviewers than artists, collectors, and other curators, who are almost always interested in his projects. Perhaps his greatest triumph was “Cities on the Move,” a collaboration with the Chinese curator Hou Hanru, which débuted in Vienna in 1997. It was a timely exploration of the artistic and demographic landscape of Asia—a look at what Koolhaas, a participant, called “cities of exacerbated difference.” Scaffolding permeated the installation; there were rickshaw taxis festooned with fabulous colors. Conventional art work peeked out from corners. In a 1999 London incarnation of the show, Koo set up a bedroom in the gallery while finishing an installation; visitors got to see the blankets and clothes that she had left behind. This time, Searle praised Obrist: “His strengths as a kind of cross-disciplinary impresario have found their subject. He knows not only how to create chaos, but also how to curate it.” In 2000, Obrist began to tire. He and Koo wanted a more stable base for their lives and he wanted to curate solo shows. “There is nothing deeper than to work for a year with the same artist,” he said. So he accepted an offer from the Musée de la Ville de Paris to be a full-time curator. He remained in France until 2006, when Julia Peyton-Jones made him her co-director at the Serpentine. Koo and Obrist now share a small apartment in Kensington, near the gallery. When I visited Obrist there, the closest thing to food in the kitchen was Diet Coke. The walls were almost bare. Fluorescent lights drenched a living room filled with books arranged on industrial shelving. Among the titles were Ben Lerner’s metafictional novel “10:04” and Jacques Derrida’s monograph on “the sense of touch.” I was bemused that a person who lived by his eyes lived in such a nondescript place, but Obrist’s interest in anything outside high culture is fitful. I never heard him talk about sports or favorite restaurants or how much something costs. He has never made a cup of coffee, and tried cooking only once; the phone rang and he forgot the saucepan, which caught fire. Sleep has always seemed extraneous to Obrist. During the early nineties, he tried Balzac’s caffeine regime, drinking dozens of cups of coffee a day. Then he switched to the Da Vinci method, limiting himself to a fifteen-minute nap every three hours. Now he tries to get four or five hours every night. He has an assistant who comes to his apartment at midnight to help him with his interviews and books. “That way, when I’m out, I know it’s time to go home,” he said. Obrist sleeps while the assistant works, then wakes up and takes over. He still likes to meet people at dawn for conversation: in 2006, he founded the Brutally Early Club, which meets at 6:30 a.m., at various sites around London. (Another of Obrist’s conceits is that modern life is characterized by a decline in ritual. He ascribes the idea to Margaret Mead.) March 8, 2010“Can you stop complaining about historical innaccuracy and try to enjoy yourself for one minute?”Buy the print » Obrist first appeared on ArtReview’s most-powerful list in 2002, and by 2009 he had risen to the top. His rolling-suitcase approach to life seemed to reflect signal changes in the art world, which was becoming faster, bigger, and vastly more international. London alone has about eight times as many galleries as it had in 1980, and Beijing and Baku and Mexico City compete for attention with Paris and New York. Increasingly, the most powerful curators are those who have the stamina (and the budget) to see enormous amounts of art and distill it into themes and movements. Among the frequent fliers are Biesenbach, of PS 1; Daniel Birnbaum, of the Moderna Museet, in Stockholm; and Massimiliano Gioni, of the New Museum, in New York. Obrist and Biesenbach first met, by chance, on a night train to Venice in 1993, on the way to the Biennale. Biesenbach, who was putting on shows in Berlin, was trying to sleep, and Obrist plunged into his compartment and kept him up the whole night. “We discussed how it’s urgent to capture the Berlin moment,” Obrist recalled. Five years later, they helped put together the first Berlin Biennial, and they have been close collaborators ever since. Birnbaum, who started out as a critic and then became a dean at an art academy, was spurred to become the sort of roving international curator Obrist is after years of conversation with him. “Hans is enthusiastic, and somehow he can make other people enthusiastic,” Birnbaum said. Obrist was also one of Gioni’s original guideposts. As a university student at Bologna, Gioni began a correspondence with Obrist that informed his practice when he entered the art world. “He really established curating as a term, a discipline, an M.O.” Gioni said, adding, “The Dadaists had Tzara, the Surrealists Breton, the futurists Marinetti, and now the international global art world has Hans Ulrich Obrist.” In many ways, an Obrist generation is running the nonprofit art world. In 2010, Jens Hoffmann, the top curator at the Jewish Museum, who considers Obrist his mentor, wrote in the magazine Mousse: “Almost all of the innovative work done by exhibition makers in mainstream art institutions over the last decade owes much to ideas that Obrist first introduced.” Not everyone considers this a good thing. Claire Bishop, an art historian at CUNY, told me, “The world of contemporary art is fast-moving and superficial and demands constant feeding, and he’s a prime example.” Though Obrist is often assumed to be the kind of megalomaniac who is more prominent than the artists he shows—and who is willing to crush the heterogeneity of artists’ work in order to extract coherent themes—that assumption doesn’t properly capture him. He seems as egoless as he is guileless and stateless. Liam Gillick said, “When you work with him, he absolutely protects you and creates enormous space for what you need to do—and yet no one knows he’s done it.” Indeed, it’s hard to reconcile the idea that Obrist is a domineering superstar with the fact that nearly all his shows are collaborations with other curators. As Gillick puts it, “He stands against a certain sort of very assertive, very authored curating that was prominent when we were young. He has a real anti-authoritarian streak.” I first met Obrist in Los Angeles, in July. He was there to conduct one of his periodic checks on the city’s art galleries. He also planned to visit the studios of John Baldessari, Ed Ruscha, and Chris Burden, and attend the L.A. Biennial, at the Hammer Museum. Finally, there was the panel on Instagram to host. Obrist is an avid user of the medium, and has more than a hundred thousand followers. The story of how he discovered Instagram is typical. During a breakfast in 2012 with Ryan Trecartin, the video artist downloaded the app onto Obrist’s phone (without asking). Next, Trecartin posted to his Instagram followers that H.U.O. had signed up. Obrist was curious, but he wondered what to do with the new tool. Inspiration was sparked by other well-known friends. On a visit to Normandy, he went for a walk with Etel Adnan, the Lebanese artist. During a rainstorm, they stopped at a café, and she wrote him a poem, by hand. This made Obrist remember Umberto Eco’s comments on how handwriting was vanishing; he also thought of marvellous faxes he had received, all handwritten, from J. G. Ballard, when he interviewed him, in 2003. Adnan’s handwritten poem became one of Obrist’s first Instagram posts. Soon afterward, he remembered that another friend, the artist Joseph Grigely, who is deaf, uses Post-It notes to communicate; they are often incorporated into his art. H.U.O. began asking dozens of artists to write something on a Post-It. He posted the scrawlings on Instagram. Yoko Ono wrote, in soft black ink, “Time to Tell your love.” Richter filled a dun-colored Post-It in his jagged hand: “Art as part of our insane capacity for hope makes it possible that we cope with our permanent madness and our boundless brutality.” Obrist just surpassed eight hundred posts. “Maybe the iPhone is the new nanomuseum,” he told me, hopefully. November 8, 2010“Did Jesus create these locally?”Buy the print » Obrist’s first stop in L.A. was at Baldessari’s studio, in Venice. He arrived there at one o’clock, in a black S.U.V. with a driver. He was wearing a three-button suit, a white shirt, and blue tennis sneakers. An old photograph of Obrist, which can be found on the Internet, shows a vigorous young man with tousled hair and intense eyes, but the Da Vinci regimen and air travel have been punishing. He is now nearly bald, and the remaining tufts of hair are white. He had chosen not to sleep the previous night in London, so that he could sleep on the flight. That, in tandem with a hood that he puts on for quick naps at his office, is his current sleep-minimizing technique. He had with him two enormously heavy pieces of luggage. “It is my exercise,” he explained. The suitcases were filled mostly with his publications, which he planned to hand out. We entered the studio through a gate. “Every visit to Los Angeles begins with John, and has for twenty years,” Obrist told me. Baldessari, eighty-three, tall and shambly, greeted us. Baldessari has contributed work to various Obrist exhibitions, and would happily do so again. “He’s like a good mom,” he told me. “ ‘Everything my son has done is good.’ ” He took us to a room where new work lined the walls. The Städel Museum, in Frankfurt, had commissioned him to reinterpret paintings from its collection; he had responded by creating large panels that juxtaposed fragments of text from screenplays with visual details scanned from works at the Städel. In one panel, movie dialogue in which two lovers discuss money was paired with a gorgeous closeup of a leg from Cranach the Elder’s 1532 painting “Venus.” Did the words and image create a plot? Or had Baldessari merely made a surreal juxtaposition? The ambiguity delighted Obrist, who pointed out that Baldessari had restored context that Cranach had deliberately stripped out. “When you have a Venus, you usually have a Cupid,” he explained. He told Baldessari, “This is amazing. So exciting!” He drew out the syllables: eg-zi-tink! Obrist has a gummy, soft smile, and a Brunelleschi dome of a forehead. He carries his shoulders back when he stands, and the effect is to shorten his arms, making him look like a boy. Afterward, we sat in Baldessari’s study, amid tables on casters stacked neatly with art magazines. “Well, that’s what I’ve been up to,” Baldessari said. “Congratulations,” Obrist said. “None of this work was here six months ago!” Soon, Obrist was back in the S.U.V. Baldessari’s work had prompted an idea: it was wise not to “isolate contemporary art” but to “create a continuum with history.” Baldessari’s project not only enlisted the spectator in making meaning; it created a junction between the living and the dead. Just as old art must look forward, new art should look back. Obrist’s next visit was to Ruscha, whose studio is a low unmarked building in Culver City, five miles away. Baldessari and Obrist have a rapport: they are both impersonally personable. Ruscha has a cooler nature, and though he recognizes Obrist’s centrality in the art world—“I see his name pretty much constantly”—he is also skeptical of him. “His telephone is continually tinging and leaving twicks and tweets and all that,” he told me, adding, “I’m like one little fragment of his interest.” Ruscha took Obrist out back to an open-air studio to show him new works in his “Psycho Spaghetti Western” series, which was inspired by roadside debris. Ruscha did not seem like Obrist’s kind of artist: his paintings have a deeply American irony that seemed destined to elude the earnest Swiss. But Obrist sought, as always, to make a connection. The strewn objects on Ruscha’s canvases, he declared, reminded him of “In the Country of Last Things,” a dystopian novel by Paul Auster. The tour finished. Ruscha took a seat behind a cherrywood desk, and fixed Obrist with his blue eyes, a dog at his feet. Obrist asked where the new paintings would be exhibited, but it was not as easy to gain traction with Ruscha as it had been with Baldessari. “In Rome. At the Gagosian gallery.” Obrist, name-dropping, said that he’d once visited Cy Twombly at his studio in Rome. Ruscha didn’t seem to care. Obrist then expressed admiration for “Guacamole Airlines,” a book of drawings that Ruscha had made. “That was forty years ago,” Ruscha said. This must have been what it was like when Obrist was a youth, surrounded by taciturn Swiss. Obrist’s arms tend to go into motion when there is silence. He asked Ruscha about a show the artist had organized at Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum, in 2012. “What did you do, exactly?” Obrist asked. Ruscha said that he had taken some “meteorites and stuffed animals and some Old Masters” and put them on display. He had included one of his own paintings. October 2, 2006“I’d like you to meet my pillows.”Buy the print » “One no longer isolates so much of contemporary art,” Obrist said, sharing his latest epiphany. “The contemporary is now connected to the historical.” Ruscha continued to smile. Eventually, he said, “They told me not to go throwing that word ‘curator’ around. I was told I was just assembling an exhibit.” “Maybe we need a new word,” Obrist said. “Yah.” “I don’t want to take more of your time,” Obrist said, after a moment. On his way out, Obrist asked Ruscha to contribute to his Instagram project. Ruscha told me later, “I gave him something that said, ‘On the bag before the tag.’ Some baseball announcer said that.” He added that he had no idea what Instagram was. Obrist, in turn, didn’t catch the baseball reference. The next day, Obrist went to visit Burden, who lives in Topanga Canyon, north of the city. He was excited: Burden was an important performance artist in the seventies, and Obrist admires the installations that he has been making in recent years. Outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art*, Burden created a dense plot of refurbished lampposts—a glowing garden that has become an actual junction for nighttime visitors. Burden also creates elaborate toys and contraptions that speak to the geeky side of Obrist, as Fischli and Weiss did long ago. After climbing a rugged road, we arrived at the top of a small mountain. Burden met us at the door. Squat and muscular, he looked as if he had been lifting weights and was still mad at them. “I can give you a tour,” he said. “Or maybe you have something to tell me.” He didn’t want photographs taken of his hangarlike studio. “Next thing you know, they’re on your Web site,” he said. Obrist put his recorder away. But he is adept at winning over artists. After touring the studio, they went outside, past rows of lampposts, ordnance shells, and mermaid caryatids. Soon they were clambering around on a forty-foot steel tower Burden had built, like two boys with a giant erector set. Back inside, Obrist asked him about unrealized projects. “I had a dream of building this city called Xanadu,” Burden said. He showed Obrist some drawings. “That is a huge unrealized project!” Obrist said. He clapped his hands with pleasure. “A real city that no one lives in.” “That’s awfully exciting. I had no idea about this!” He promised to visit Burden again on his next trip. As the S.U.V. careered down the hill, Obrist checked his e-mails and texts and pronounced the visit “super-super-productive.” In mid-October, Obrist put on the Serpentine’s ninth annual Marathon, in Hyde Park. The press had framed the show, “Extinction: Visions of the Future,” as a depressing alternative to the ebullient Frieze Art Fair taking place in Regent’s Park. Nevertheless, the Serpentine event drew a crowd, with more than four thousand attendees. It had a carnival feel, underscored by three big Mylar balloons, spelling out “HUO,” that were tethered to a tent where the speakers gathered. When I arrived, Obrist, wearing a blue single-breasted suit, was making rapid-fire introductions among the gathered artists, ecologists, writers, researchers, activists, sages, and prognosticators. He seemed to be going slightly mad. Obrist told me that his own unrealized project is to found a new version of Black Mountain College, the defunct North Carolina retreat where, sixty years ago, top practitioners in the arts, culture, and the sciences taught and exchanged ideas. That ambition, combined with his admiration for Diaghilev, had shaped the Serpentine event. The guiding presence was the eighty-eight-year-old artist Gustav Metzger, who had sat through the entire first Marathon. Although he is ailing and in a wheelchair, he attended nearly all of this year’s proceedings. Obrist, in his opening remarks, declared that Metzger—a longtime environmental activist—had helped inspire the theme of “Extinction.” Julia Peyton-Jones, who sometimes plays the goof to Obrist’s Luftmensch, dedicated the Marathon to the pangolin—an adorable, endangered mammal that looks like an anteater. September 23, 2002“Now that the kids are in jail maybe we can take that vacation we always wanted to take.”Buy the print » The performances and the talks took place on a small stage with a backdrop of an oversized hand pointing at black trash bags. To begin, several scientists delivered bad news. At least eight hundred and seventy species had been wiped out in the past four hundred years. Jonathan Baillie, of the London Zoological Society, noted that, of the seven remaining northern-white rhinos, one had died the previous day, in Kenya. Jennifer Jacquet, an environmental social scientist at New York University, spoke about the decimation of the Steller’s sea cow, which was hunted for sport—and for its blubber—in the eighteenth century. Suddenly, Gilbert & George, the painting duo known for cheeky irony, came onstage, in bespoke nibbed suits and bright-colored ties. They unfurled spray-painted posters. “BURN THAT BOOK,” Gilbert’s said. “FUCK THE PLANET,” George’s said. They were lampooning the ignorance of climate-change deniers, but the audience wasn’t sure what to make of them. After a few more speakers, Obrist stood up. “Coffee breaks are urgent!” he said.  Later in the day, Stewart Brand, who created the “Whole Earth Catalog,” amused the crowd when he took a showy tumble off the stage, to impersonate the death of a lemming. Brand then spoke about efforts to clone extinct species. Passenger pigeons would come first, he promised, then mammoths. The more excited Brand got, the more uncomfortable the audience seemed. Obrist informed me that his friend John Brockman, a science impresario and literary agent, had selected most of the scientists. “We don’t know the important scientists, and they don’t know the good artists,” Obrist explained. Perhaps as a result, the science had an austere implacability to it, and the art often seemed to aestheticize tragedy. Benedict Drew, a young English artist, created a hectic digital montage that included a disembodied head and images of a garbage dump intercut with ominous messages. (“We are done for.”) The piece, weighed down with sinister synthesizer music, was called “Not Happy.” When the words “Why you so happy Pharrell” flashed, the audience laughed in relief. At times, the worlds of science and art came together: an oddly moving presentation by Trevor Paglen focussed on communication satellites that will circle the earth for billions of years after humans are extinct. But most of the time the scientists conveyed the information and the artists the hurt. A bewildering variety of extinctions were invoked: of plants, of gays, of languages, of books on paper, of celluloid film. Obrist, surrounded by half-drunk cups of coffee, got up to introduce presenters and then sat back down in the front row, where he and Peyton-Jones, who sat by his side, passed notes to each other and to their assistants, who sat behind them. The Marathon ended with a new participatory piece by Yoko Ono that was read aloud by Lily Cole, a model and environmental activist, for which the audience was given small bells to ring. “Don’t try to change the world, that’s a concept floating on our horizon,” Cole read. “Just use your wits and change your heads.” On a large screen by the stage, the words “Surrender to Peace” appeared. In the audience, bells prettily chimed. The message seemed at odds with much of the Marathon. Wasn’t changing the world the point? Then again, there was not a single policy official among the eighty participants. The real goal, it seemed, was to conjure a sense of community. “It was quite magical,” Obrist said of the chorus of bells. “The participants did at least fifty per cent of the work.” He added that “smaller actions can lead to bigger actions.” Obrist had brought together an eye-catching roster of participants, but epic conversation was not well suited to addressing the urgent topic of extinction. It sometimes seems that Obrist doesn’t care so much what people say, as long as they keep talking. In 2003, Hal Foster, an art historian at Princeton, published an essay that touched on Obrist’s first collection of interviews. “Formlessness in society might be a condition to contest rather than to celebrate in art,” Foster pointed out. Nothing at the Marathon was as strong as a Metzger work titled “Flailing Trees”: twenty-one willows planted upside down in concrete. The installation was first displayed in 2009, at the Manchester International Festival. Metzger had been included in that festival at Obrist’s suggestion, and it had been a smart one: “Flailing Trees” is rigorous, beautiful, sad. December 1, 2008“Load the holiday catalogues.”Buy the print » After the Marathon, Obrist told me that the performance artist Tino Seghal had watched a live stream of the Marathon and had especially enjoyed a talk by Elizabeth Povinelli, an anthropologist at Columbia. “Tino’s reading her book now!” Obrist said. Who knew what collaborations might result? This was a different sort of Gesamtkunstwerk, he said—“one more in time than in space.” As the crowd dispersed, H.U.O. posed in front of the balloons with his initials. “This topic isn’t going to be solved in a night,” he said. “I see the ‘Extinction’ Marathon as a movement.” Then he noted, “I have a five-forty train in the morning. The Eurostar to Paris.” "
The New Yorker,L,New York’s Verdict: We Can’t Breathe - The New Yorker,"

 


Credit PHOTOGRAPH BY JULIO CORTEZ/AP								 


If you don’t read anything else today, I suggest you look at the editorial about Eric Garner in the Times and Bill Bramhall’s editorial cartoon in the Daily News. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } The editorial points out the obvious, which, in this case, needed saying: “The imbalance between Mr. Garner’s fate, on a Staten Island sidewalk in July, and his supposed infraction, selling loose cigarettes, is grotesque and outrageous.” Bramhall’s cartoon shows Lady Justice, splayed out on the sidewalk, her sword and scales of justice scattered around her, saying, “I … CAN’T … BREATHE.” Those words were, of course, the last ones that Garner, a forty-three-year-old black man, uttered while being held down on a sidewalk on Staten Island by cops, including one, officer Daniel Pantaleo, who had him in what N.Y.P.D. commissioner William Bratton subsequently described as an unauthorized chokehold. In a front-page headline, the Daily News changed Garner’s words a bit, to read “We Can’t Breathe,” which accurately summed up the feelings of many New Yorkers, and many Americans outside New York, when they heard that a grand jury had decided not to bring charges against Pantaleo or anyone else. Coming less than two weeks after another grand jury, in Ferguson, Missouri, decided not to bring any charges in the death of Michael Brown, this latest news prompted a series of protests, most of them peaceful, in New York and other cities. That was understandable—necessary, even. Garner’s death, on July 17th, was, in some ways, even more shocking, and even harder to fathom, than what happened in Missouri. In that case, most witnesses agree, there was an altercation between Brown and Officer Darren Wilson, who followed Brown out of his car, across the street, and shot him dead. In this one, on Bay Street, in the Tompkinsville section of Staten Island, not very far from the ferry terminal, Garner was standing in front of a beauty-supply store when some police officers approached him and apparently alleged that he was peddling loose cigarettes. A video recorded by a friend of Garner named Ramsey Orta shows much of what ensued; it suggests that Garner posed no threat to anybody. Having been picked up before in similar circumstances, Garner told the cops to leave him alone, gesturing with his hands as he spoke. As a couple of officers reached for him, he said, “Don’t touch me, please.” More officers joined in the struggle, and Pantaleo seized Garner from behind, subduing him and bowling him over, before Garner was cuffed. After losing consciousness, he went into cardiac arrest and died in an ambulance that came to pick him up. An autopsy by the city’s medical examiner’s office found that Garner died as a result of compression of the neck and body, and cited his history of asthma, heart disease, and obesity as contributing factors. The office ruled the death a homicide, which simply means the killing of one person by another. The question that the grand jury faced was whether this was a lawful killing. After its decision was announced, Pantaleo issued a statement in which he said, “I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who can’t protect themselves. It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner.” Evidently, the members of the grand jury believed that Pantaleo bore no criminal intent, and this would explain why they didn’t indict him for murder. However, the question remains why no charges of criminally negligent homicide have been brought against Pantaleo or any of his colleagues who left Garner on the ground for several minutes before trying to resuscitate him, or any of the emergency medical staff who showed up and, according to some accounts, didn’t do much to assist him either. (After the incident, several medics were suspended without pay.) If you watch Orta’s video, and another, released later, showing Garner as he lay on the street, handcuffed, it’s hard to avoid reaching the conclusion that, at the very least, there was serious negligence on display. In the past twenty-five years, the New York Police Department has had a lot to be proud of. It pioneered data-driven policing and helped bring the city’s crime rate down to historic lows. Even in poor and deprived areas, such as the area where Garner lived, crime is a lot less common than it used to be. For example, N.Y.P.D. figures show that, in 1990, there were more than sixty-seven hundred serious crimes (murders, rapes, assaults, robberies, burglaries, and grand larcenies) reported in the Hundred and Twentieth Precinct, which includes Tompkinsville. Last year, there were fewer than fourteen hundred such crimes, a decline of about eighty per cent. And, as the crime rate has dropped, the N.Y.P.D., unlike some other police forces, has gone out of its way to recruit minorities: at the rank of police officer, there are now more minority cops than white cops in New York. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }But reducing crime and integrating the ranks doesn’t justify mistreating elements of the citizenry who don’t present a genuine public threat, particularly unarmed black men; and it certainly doesn’t justify causing their deaths. As the Times editorial put it, “Any police department that tolerates such conduct, and whose officers are unable or unwilling to defuse such confrontations without killing people, needs to be reformed.”

"
The New Yorker,L,Why Cameras on Police Officers Won’t Save Us - The New Yorker,"

 


One reaction to the decision by a grand jury in New York, on Wednesday, not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put a Staten Island man named Eric Garner in an unauthorized chokehold that killed him, is despair over cameras as potential instruments of juridical salvation. On Monday, in an effort to improve police accountability after a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, declined to indict the white police officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old, the Obama Administration announced that it would provide local police departments with funding to purchase fifty thousand body-worn video cameras. Garner’s death had became infamous precisely because it was videotaped by a friend of Garner’s with a cell phone, and the video, which we could all watch on YouTube, was not blurry or muffled or ambiguous. It was not at all hard to make out Garner’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” repeated over and over and over again. My son, a college freshman in New York, texted me after the grand-jury news came out: “What makes this sad is it shows the mandatory cameras for cops idea might not change anything.” If evidence like that in the Garner case couldn’t elicit an indictment, what was the point? if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } The truth is that if the cameras do offer a benefit—and there is some, not a lot, of research showing that they do—it’s in influencing behavior before the fact, not providing evidence after it. In two cities where the effect of body-worn cameras has been studied—Rialto, California, and Mesa, Arizona—researchers noted that the cameras had exerted “a civilizing effect” on police behavior. In Rialto, citizen complaints against the police declined by eighty-eight per cent during the year that the cameras were used, while the use of force by police officers fell by sixty per cent. Moreover, the incidents involving the use of force by camera-wearing officers all started with a suspect physically threatening the officer. The numbers suggest that such provocation was not an essential element with officers who weren’t wearing cameras. In a 2014 Department of Justice report, the criminologist Michael D. White, who looked at five empirical studies involving body-worn cameras (two in Arizona, one in California, one in England, and one in Scotland), notes that we can’t be sure what produced the decrease in complaints and instances of use of force by the camera-wearing cops. It could be that the officers, knowing that their actions were being recorded, behaved with more restraint, or it could be that citizens did. But it seems more likely that the police would be conscious of the camera’s presence—the devices are usually worn hooked to a shirt or mounted on a pair of sunglasses, and the officers knew that they were participating in an experiment—than most civilians, who may not notice the green recording light. White concluded that the videotapes played some role in chronicling and accounting for police actions: they helped police officers to resolve citizen complaints against them more quickly, and they made unwarranted and frivolous complaints less likely. As it happened, the benefits as evidence tended to accrue to the police—which is fine, of course, provided that they are serving the larger goal of establishing the truth and a standard of behavior. Still, most people who have high hopes for the cameras probably aren’t primarily concerned with wiping out some scourge of frivolous citizen complaints but, rather, with achieving justice for citizens like Eric Garner. Maybe the bigger lesson is, again, that cameras won’t save us. Like photographs and like eyewitness testimony, video evidence is subject to differing interpretations, and to the prejudices and assumptions of individual viewers. We’ve known that for a long time; still, we can’t help hoping. One of the only cases in recent years in which a New York police officer was indicted, charged, and convicted in the death of a citizen occurred in 1994. As it happens, it also involved a police officer administering a chokehold to a man, the twenty-nine-year-old asthmatic Anthony Baez, a security guard who was playing football in the street with his brothers when the ball landed on a police car, and an altercation ensued. Why that case and not Garner’s resulted in an indictment isn’t clear—and, in any event, the officer’s conviction was later overturned. But there was no video evidence in Baez’s case. And yet the cell-phone video of Eric Garner’s death was not meaningless. The fact that so many people watched it is part of what fuelled the outrage that produced demonstrations, as well as a Justice Department investigation that the Obama Administration announced this week. But there is also something deeply sad and demoralizing about having in our collective possession such a vivid record of a death that could neither be prevented nor, in any immediate way, remedied.

The New Yorker,L,The Carnival Logic of “American Horror Story: Freak Show”,"

 

This season of the show takes the 1932 movie “Freaks” as an inspiration.

“A little culture for the TV viewers. God knows they need it,” Madame Elsa, played by Jessica Lange, purrs. A sideshow impresario and a double amputee, Elsa has just finished crooning “September Song” to her lover, Paul the Illustrated Seal—she’s rehearsing for her anticipated musical début on that novelty stage of the nineteen-fifties, the television screen. Handsome as a matinée idol, Paul (Mat Fraser) reclines on an ottoman, his flippers resting beside his tattooed chest. “American Horror Story” has always been a show dedicated to spectacle, and when I first heard that this season would be set in a freak show in Florida I yelped out loud. What could be more perfect? Brassy and divinely decadent, “American Horror Story,” which was co-created by Ryan Murphy and is now in its fourth season, is one of TV’s few truly experimental series—and, like many seedy carnivals, it’s been subject to both nervous laughter and progressive criticism. A mashup of sensational genres, from horror to vaudeville, the show has revived the anthology model, with a new setting and a new story each season. A revolving repertory of actors—Lange, Sarah Paulson, Kathy Bates, Denis O’Hare—play different roles each round (and often adopt ever crazier accents). Like many of Murphy’s shows (he also created “Glee” and “Nip/Tuck”), “American Horror Story” doesn’t always make sense. Sometimes, as with “Coven,” last season’s arc, which dealt with witchcraft and slavery, it’s downright clumsy about its incendiary themes. But when it shines—as was the case during its most brilliant season, “Asylum”—the show is a true provocation, a scream in both senses, drawing little distinction between a scare, a turn-on, an eye roll, and a giggle. It’s a smart show that’s never haughty or solemn, with an aesthetic that’s reflexively shameless, in the best way, about serious subjects—including, this season, disability.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } Andrew Solomon, in his excellent book “Far from the Tree,” describes two kinds of identity available to the disabled: “vertical” (the family they’re descended from) and “horizontal” (the people with whom they share a physical trait, like dwarfism or deafness). “Freak Show” is about many things—clown phobia, snuff films, David Bowie—but, primarily, it’s about horizontal identity, as viewed in a fun-house mirror, distorted by fury and desire. In this theme, it replicates its source material: the classic horror movie “Freaks” (1932), which was about circus performers who take violent revenge on a villainous “normal” woman, Cleopatra, when she exploits a member of their troupe. (If Cleopatra existed in the modern era, the word for her would be “ableist.”) The director Tod Browning’s pet project (he ran away at sixteen to join the circus himself), the film was a notorious flop, and wrecked its creator’s career. The studio demanded that Browning edit out a castration sequence and add a sappy ending; even so, after a test screening the producers were accused of causing a moviegoer’s miscarriage. In the nineteen-seventies, “Freaks” became a cult sensation, best known for the chant “Gooble, gobble! One of us, one of us!” “Freak Show” is an elaborate remix of the original, stamping Browning’s iconic characters with Murphy’s high-camp image: Cleopatra becomes Lange’s Germanic dominatrix, who lost her legs to a chain saw; Michael Chiklis plays a closeted strongman; Kathy Bates is a poignant bearded lady; Angela Bassett is a three-breasted “hermaphrodite”; and Sarah Paulson is the conjoined twins Dot and Bette, who lean in from the sides of the frame like wilted stalks. (They’re so frequently filmed as reflections in mirrors that, often, they feel like doubles of a double.) We’re now two-thirds of the way through the season, and the series continues to offer up variants on the “Freaks” narrative, about a “normal” girl who flirts with a “freak,” placing them side by side with more earnest themes, like the hunt for a non-bigoted doctor. Murphy has also folded in his own obsessions: glam-rock musical numbers, homoerotic serial killers, and the toxic effects of Hollywood vanity. Refreshingly, the season is also genuinely frightening, with at least one truly nightmarish vision per week. It opened with one of the series’s dirtiest, weirdest villains yet, a mute clown named Twisty, who kidnapped children; once Twisty was dispatched, up popped a chilling replacement, Dandy, a preening sociopath who styles himself the U.S. Steel of Murder. Dandy became Twisty’s assistant, or maybe just his unpaid intern, after he received the clown as an ill-conceived gift from his mother. A spoiled American man-child, Dandy murders as a form of narcissistic tantrum—or perhaps, his mother suggests, as the result of upper-class inbreeding. “Jack the Ripper was a Windsor, for God’s sake!” she exclaims. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }Like “Freaks,” “Freak Show” also mingles able-bodied actors—some wear prosthetics, while others are altered with special effects—with what the marvellously charismatic Mat Fraser terms a “radically different person onstage entertaining with their radical difference.” Fraser is a British performance artist, sometimes using the name Seal Boy, who has created shows like the burlesque “Beauty and the Beast” and “Thalidomide!! A Musical.” There’s also Jyoti Amge, as Ma Petite, a tiny dwarf; the trans actress Erika Ervin, as the giantess Amazon Eve; and Ben Woolf, who has pituitary dwarfism, as Meep, a pinhead. Rose Siggins, who was born with a condition called sacral agenesis, plays Legless Suzi. When the season began, these characters had few lines, which suggested a tricky hierarchy: the real-life Seal Boy was an extra in scenes starring Evan Peters’s prosthetically created Human Lobster. But, midway through the season, Murphy began to shift the spotlight, mining these bodies and personalities for warmth, sex, and tragedy. A sequence in which the lovable Ma Petite stands in a large glass jar, fluttering her fingers like a butterfly, became one of the show’s most frightening bits of poetry, like some candied fairy tale from Oscar Wilde. Not surprisingly, Murphy’s approach has triggered complaints of exploitation—and not for the first time. Four of Murphy’s shows include characters, and actors, who have Down syndrome. On “Glee,” Artie (played by an able-bodied actor) was in a wheelchair. In “Asylum,” Chloë Sevigny played a nymphomaniac whose limbs had been amputated. There are many other examples—in fact, there are so many disabled characters in Ryan Murphy’s series that it’s impossible to judge these portrayals as a class, although it’s worth noting that, like Madame Elsa, Murphy is the rare impresario who explores this subject matter at all. Along with the concern that he’s a huckster, his shows raise the question of what it means to have stars “crip” or “spack up”—disdainful terms for able-bodied actors playing disabled characters. This debate, among disability advocates, has analogues to similar issues about cross-racial and transgender roles, from Mickey Rooney’s notorious “yellow-face,” in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” to Jared Leto’s turn as a transgender character, in “Dallas Buyers Club.” Activists complain that Hollywood stars win Oscars, and score points for “bravery,” in roles that could go to a disabled actor. They resent the notion that disability itself is a costume. That’s what acting is, of course: it’s putting on a new identity. But what makes blackface different from drag, or from adding a flipper? In Murphy’s case, I’m no fan of some of the more sentimental disability plots on “Glee,” or of the dirty jokes given to Becky, a cheerleader with Down—gags that felt both queasy and hackish, although no more so than other aspects of the show, in later seasons. Given the rarity of disabled bodies on TV, it can verge on icky (or problematic, to use that awful term of art) to view those few through a fish-eye lens. And while Sarah Paulson is revelatory as the conjoined twins—and I wouldn’t want anyone but Lange to play Elsa—I found myself rooting for the “real disabled” to be more than color, or moral coverage, among the able-bodied stars. It was a relief when Fraser was effectively promoted, becoming the heartthrob of a romantic triangle with Elsa and Penny (Grace Gummer), the candy striper he fell for during an opium-addled orgy. Still, the related complaint, that the characters are bad role models, misses the point, from my perspective. “Freak Show” embodies the philosophy put forth by Fraser in a promotional video for the series: while do-gooders view the sideshow as nefarious, it was, historically, the one place where people with odd anatomies were glamorized, not hidden away. There they could make money, live independently, and find sex and love. The difference between gawking and gazing, fearing and desiring, is not so simple. Murphy’s “freaks”—both the organic and the artificial ones—aren’t lessons for the able-bodied, and when the show does veer into pedantry (“You’re the real freaks!”) it’s at its weakest. They’re divas and lovers and revengers and martyrs, who get to experience the extremes of human emotion. There are enough of them so that they can’t be only one thing. At the show’s best moments, they’re stars, not props. “American Horror Story” will never be for every viewer; it is, above all else, rude. In the first season, it was rude about a rapist in a black latex gimp mask. In the second season, it was rude about a lampshade made of breast skin. In the third season, it was so rude that it was incoherent. By rude, I don’t mean “politically incorrect,” that inane term for celebrating stupid remarks for their honesty. I mean rude in a grander sense: brazen and crude and funky, open to the ugly as well as to the beautiful, with a vision of the body as a source of both suffering and ecstasy. This sort of rudeness derives from the understanding that, some of the time, a demand for politeness is really a demand to be quiet and disappear. This coarseness gives the show leeway to be, at times, both nasty and funny, making it impossible to distinguish its best from its worst—as in a recent episode in which a “normal” was tattooed, and her tongue forked, against her will, a sequence that felt at once nonsensical and indelible. The series is endlessly, archly quotable: “They said I made men ejaculate gold,” Elsa reminisces, of her days as a dominatrix in the Weimar Republic. If it risks going too far, that’s an “American Horror Story” tradition, too—it’s why we watch through our fingers, squinching our eyes. Why go to the circus if there’s no chance of blood? "

Coming just two weeks after the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown, the non-indictment of Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner has the feel of a grim serial filled with redundant plot lines—a production that few of us wish to watch but none of us can avoid, and that a great many are complicit in creating. This is not imaginary. Here is the man who aspired to become the first black President counselling calm following the acquittal of the officers who shot and killed Sean Bell, an unarmed black man, on the eve of Bell’s wedding, in New York, in 2006.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } }   Obviously there was a tragedy in New York. I said at the time, without benefit of all the facts before me, that it looked like a possible case of excessive force. The judge has made his ruling, and we’re a nation of laws, so we respect the verdict that came down.  Here is that same man, having now attained the office, counselling calm in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who killed the seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, another unarmed black man, in Sanford, Florida, in 2012.  The death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher.   But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.  Two weeks ago, we saw the President, now in the last years of his second term, urge patience following the non-indictment of Darren Wilson, who shot and killed the eighteen-year-old Michael Brown, who was unarmed.  First and foremost, we are a nation built on the rule of law. And so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury’s to make. There are Americans who agree with it, and there are Americans who are deeply disappointed, even angry. It’s an understandable reaction. But I join Michael’s parents in asking anyone who protests this decision to do so peacefully.  Last night’s statement from the President regarding the unprosecuted death of Eric Garner establishes that history does not repeat itself verbatim—it usually changes the proper nouns.  Some of you may have heard there was a decision that came out today by a grand jury not to indict police officers who had interacted with an individual [named] Eric Garner in New York City, all of which was caught on videotape and speaks to the larger issues that we’ve been talking about now for the last week, the last month, the last year, and, sadly, for decades, and that is the concern … of too many minority communities, that law enforcement is not working with them and dealing with them in a fair way.  None of this is President Obama’s fault; yet all of it reflects upon him. All of these redundancies indict the anodyne calls for “healing” that inevitably come in their wake. Here we don’t heal. We scar. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }The stilted conversations that have followed these tragedies have largely focussed on the meaning and implications of the nonsensical phrase “racial profiling.” Nothing better illustrates the slick, manipulative power of euphemism than the fact that our dialogue takes seriously this non-term. There is no such thing as “racial profiling”—there is simply racism. What subsequent action, what logical end, does racial profiling produce that abject racism would not? The supposed definition of “racial profiling”—that the alleged behavior of any fragment of a population becomes the basis for categorizing it in its sum, that epidermal hues are a valid means of reflexively predicting character—is what we, in more honest moments in our past, simply referred to as racism. If there is any glimmer of interracial unity to be found amid this morass, it’s found in the fact that black people and whites alike share a common confusion regarding racial profiling. Witness Charles Barkley, opining in favor of the practice. “We as black people, we have a lot of crooks. We can’t just wait until something like [the Brown shooting] happens. We have to look at ourselves in the mirror,” Barkley said in an interview with CNN. “There is a reason that they racially profile us in the way they do. Sometimes it is wrong, and sometimes it is right.” Fresh from an appearance on “Meet the Press,” where he charged that black crime, not police brutality, was the real problem, Rudolph Giuliani doubled down on “Fox News Sunday”:  I do believe that there is more interaction and more unfair interaction among police officers, white and black, in the black community than in the white community. And I think some of that responsibility is on the police department and on police departments to train their police officers better and to make their police departments much more diversified.   But I think just as much, if not more, responsibility is on the black community to reduce the reason why the police officers are assigned in such large numbers to the black community. It’s because blacks commit murder eight times more per capita than any other group in our society.  There’s a smugness that abides in these arguments, which benefit from the conflation of audacity with veracity. Far from being a novel bit of truth-telling, the argument that black crime is the cause of reactionary policing is among the aged and easily refuted clichés of American racial history. The spectre of black criminality justified governmental inaction against lynching during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. When, in 1906, whites began wresting black passengers from streetcars and murdering them in the streets of downtown Atlanta, sparking three days of riots and resulting in dozens of black casualties, a specious wave of black crime was cited as the basis for their actions. In a masterstroke of soothing illogic, segregationists responded to the challenge posed by the civil-rights movement by arguing that black enfranchisement and equality could not be broached as long as “Negro crime” remained prevalent; they claimed, in short, that ending oppression was contingent upon eliminating the conditions that oppression had in fact produced. This perspective has prevailed and even, from time to time, won converts among African-Americans. Listening to Bill Cosby’s responsibility tirades, in the years prior to this fall, it was possible to believe that black pathology created racism, and that racism could not subside until the pathology was treated. Where whites find a facile absolution in this argument, black people find a simple solution to the miasma of racism, one rooted in the American ideals of self-reliance and determination. The most obvious contradiction to this doctrine of behavior modification is also the one least spoken. Gun homicide has declined by forty-nine per cent since its peak, in 1993, largely because of a decline in homicides perpetrated by black offenders against black victims. This reduction in violent crime over more than two decades has done little to diminish white fear of black criminality, or the potency of “black crime” in justifying the violation of black rights. Of course, racism, being a superstition, has never been contingent upon facts. That this argument finds particular favor among conservatives is even more preposterous. The idea that the treatment of an individual hinges upon his or her demographic category flies in the face of the doctrine of individual rights central to modern conservatism. African-Americans are thirteen per cent of the population; they are also, horrifyingly, fifty-five per cent of the homicide victims. Whites, meanwhile, are sixty-three per cent of the population, but are only a quarter of the homicide victims. Yet, even if you eliminated every black homicide, the United States would still have a more violent population than Western democracies like the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Based on the logic of collective responsibility at the heart of “racial profiling,” we should also be asking white communities what they’ve done to deal with their tendency toward violence. The fact that Americans die at the hands of other Americans is, one would naïvely suspect, an American problem—but if those Americans are black, it is considered anything but. This is the alchemy by which racial category takes precedent, yet again, over supposed citizenship. This is the skewed thinking that forms the context in which black people die in the United States. Contrary to the thinking of its most indignant critics, the slogan “Black Lives Matter” is not an argument that deaths that come at the hands of the police warrant outrage, while those caused by common citizens warrant disregard. It’s a statement that these forms of violence reinforce each other in a vicious cycle of human devaluation. If there’s particular outrage about police violence, that’s because it strips us of the possibility of recourse for other violations. A democracy of grief binds those of us who survive people who were violently dispatched from this life—those who die at the hands of civilians, those who die from the wrongful actions of people empowered by the state. The sole difference between these deaths is that only with the former do we already know it’s a crime.

A plan to turn the old Samaritaine department store into a five-star hotel is at the center of a debate about what Paris is becoming. 
Credit Photograph by Denis Allard / Rea / Redux									 


The Pont des Arts, in Paris, is a steel-and-wood footbridge that connects Left Bank to Right—or, more important to its history and its name, connects the École des Beaux-Arts, where generations of French artists were told how to draw, to the Louvre, where generations went to find out how to look. It was, until relatively recently, a soulful and solitary passerelle, where one could stand for hours in winter, mostly alone, staring out at the view west toward the older, stone parapet of the Pont Royal and the Eiffel Tower, or east toward Notre-Dame and the sharp-jawed Île de la Cité. The view north, toward the Right Bank, remained, until the end of the twentieth century, interestingly mixed, with the newly cleaned Cour Carrée of the Louvre straight ahead and, just to the right, the shiplike prow of the Samaritaine department store, proudly flying a couple of pennants from its top. In the past nine years, all that has changed. La Samaritaine, which for almost a century and a half represented the “Bonheur des Dames,” the “happiness of ladies” (a title that Zola used ironically, referring to the bourgeois pursuit of material goods in department stores), has closed. The store is emptied, mute and dark and flagless, its fourteen hundred employees gone, as the French luxury conglomerate L.V.M.H. struggles to turn it into a postmodern, glass-encased beacon meant for another kind of woman and another kind of happiness, and so finds itself pitted against preservationists who want neither postmodern glimmer nor luxury glitter—who want, in fact, the same damn happiness for the same damn women.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } Meanwhile, the Pont des Arts groans beneath the weight of the “love locks” that have become a rashlike infestation on small Paris bridges in the past few years. Lovers buy cheap padlocks from lock sellers, scribble their initials on the lock, shackle the lock to the bridge’s railings, and then throw the key into the river. At first, there were a few, then there were a lot, and now they are everywhere, about three-quarters of a million in all, locks shackled to locks shackled to locks shackled to locks, every square inch of the bridge crowded with black initials, brass bodies. Earlier this year, some of the grillwork of the Pont des Arts collapsed under the weight of all that love. The city government has been slow to act, partly for the usual exasperating French bureaucratic reasons—before something can actually be done, it must be decided if it is the administrative responsibility of the Prefecture of Police, of the Hôtel de Ville, or, perhaps, of the Ministry of Culture—and partly out of a genuine bewilderment over how to constrain the passionate gestures of tourists on whose illusions of Paris as the best place to declare one’s love the city’s economy ever more depends. Two American women, not long ago tourists themselves, have emerged to energize and unleash the popular passion of Paris against the love locks. When Americans visit the bridge now, what there is to see is not the modern and the antique but another opposition: in the distance, the collapse of the grand bourgeois mercantile civilization of Paris and, straight ahead, the excrescences of mass tourism that have replaced it as a central Parisian industry. The view from the footbridge now, in the city that the American women came to savor and stayed to help save, offers a tight knot of paradoxes about the history of Paris, the tempering of glass, and the shackles of love. In the late nineteenth century, Parisian department stores, which began as catchall indoor marketplaces, with individual venders selling drygoods, interbred with the glass exhibition palaces of the period to produce a new building type and a new idea of luxury: all the world’s goods suspended on multiple floors under the natural light of a great, and usually decorated, glass ceiling. La Samaritaine—the name derives from a seventeenth-century fountain with a bas-relief of the Samaritan woman that used to stand nearby—began as one of these closed retail drygoods markets, colonizing, piece by piece, a miscellany of buildings between the Seine and the Rue de Rivoli; Printemps and the Galeries Lafayette emerged as rivals farther back on the grands boulevards. The stores gave an identity to the neighborhood and an idea of popular luxury to the world. La Samaritaine was, by general agreement, the most “popular” of the great stores, a sort of Macy’s-plus, if one can imagine Macy’s on the banks of the Seine with a view of a Gothic cathedral. Then, at the beginning of this new century, the crisis in retailing that has struck the rest of the world struck Paris—the grands magasins had to do battle with what are called here grandes surfaces, the super-big-box retailers that, though kept by law largely to the periphery, are nonetheless good at drawing shoppers in for inexpensive furniture and appliances. Just as the Zola-era department store drove out of business all the small shops of the quartier—the Parisian shopping streets beloved of Americans are a much reduced version of the older kind, with only perishables surviving—so the grandes surfaces have been driving out the great department stores. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }When L.V.M.H. (the name of the conglomerate, overseen by the tycoon Bernard Arnault, combines the initials of Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, the suitcase maker and the champagne house) bought an interest in La Samaritaine, in 2001, it had already turned the Bon Marché, on the Left Bank, from a bourgeois store to a luxe one—from an Alexander’s to a Bergdorf’s. It faced a bigger project with La Samaritaine: to turn the familiar Seine-side building into a five-star hotel, with controlled access to the once famous roof terrace and restaurant. L.V.M.H. approached the Japanese architectural firm of Sanaa. The plan that Sanaa came up with, which also included retail space and low-income housing, was officially inspired by the building complex’s original architect, Frantz Jourdain. Conceiving the project in Art Nouveau style, he left intact the various façades of the buildings on the Rue de Rivoli that it was recycled from. The renovation, the company announced, was “an opportunity to complete Frantz Jourdain’s unfinished project to give La Samaritaine a single, immediately recognizable façade in the Rue de Rivoli.” The most striking exterior feature of the new architectural model is a billowing, wavelike wall of translucent glass meant to unify the Rue de Rivoli side both by referring to the original verrière roof and by creating a single visual unit that pulls the façades together. This kind of oceanic glass front has become a signature, even a tic, of contemporary French architecture—including the many glass façades by Jean Nouvel and Christian de Portzamparc’s twisted crystal tower at L.V.M.H.’s U.S. headquarters, on Fifty-seventh Street in Manhattan. The glass façade suggests, in turn, the long French infatuation with glass walls—prismatic, waving, billowing, or bending—as the symbol and material of modernity or, in this case, postmodernity. Beautiful though the Samaritaine façade promises to be, its critics think that it distracts from the reality that the L.V.M.H. plan, centered on a new hotel, would make the old department store one more luxury destination for Paris transients, rather than a regular retailer for Paris residents. This transformation increased Parisians’ natural suspicion of Arnault’s enterprise—L.V.M.H. having become, to its doubters, a kind of sinister luxury-goods octopus, a monopoly vender of French brands to ascending Asia. When preparatory work began on the Sanaa design, two years ago, preservationists sued. The first level of French magistrates temporarily revoked L.V.M.H.’s building permit, then L.V.M.H. appealed, and the case now rests with the Cour d’Appel, which is expected to rule in early December. “Sanaa won the Pritzker prize, of course,” Marie-Line Antonios, of La Samaritaine, says, a little defensively. Spokesmen for La Samaritaine always emphasize the Pritzker, rather in the way that beauty-pageant hosts in America emphasize all the college scholarships the contestants are winning, trying to make it plain that what may look like dazzle is really virtue. Antonios is the directrice générale of the Samaritaine project, which means that, right now, she is the executive who is charged with not running a big department store. Originally from Lebanon, she can be found these days at offices on the Left Bank, on the Rue Saint-André-des-Arts: a sort of Samaritaine in exile, as she and her team wait for the government to allow them to complete the renovation. She has the weary, guarded look of someone who has been cornered and harried at every turn by self-righteous preservationists and self-important city bureaucrats. “L.V.M.H. is the sort of name that is an easy target,” she says with a sigh. “Everyone feels that L.V.M.H. can do what it wants, when in truth it’s just the opposite. It would be much easier to do this if it weren’t L.V.M.H.” She explains that the complexity of the project was necessitated by the history of La Samaritaine, assembled, as it was, from bits and pieces of older buildings. “On the Rue de Rivoli side, there were seventeenth- and eighteenth-century buildings, but they were all destroyed and adapted to commerce long ago. It is a mélange, with false façades. But the opponents couldn’t accept having even those demolished. The patrimony fights against all projects in Paris.” She frowns. “We obtained the building permit for the program in December, 2012, and we worked for seventeen months—but it’s worse than in New York, the rules, and we had to stop in May, 2014, and then last week we won the right to begin again. But that’s a provisional decision. The final one we’ll have in December. So it’s taken seven years to get the consent, and then have it revoked. But, if all goes well, in 2018 we’ll be finished. Let’s remember: everything facing the Seine will be unchanged—everything!” It’s true that only the mostly nondescript Rue de Rivoli side will be glassed over. But while the nineteenth-century glass was largely functional, letting in light, the new façade is mostly symbolic, trapping light. Not surprisingly, Christian de Portzamparc has published a letter in Le Monde in praise of that aspect of it: “A disparate façade on the Rue de Rivoli is transformed and unified into an undulant, diaphanous one, bringing light and loveliness to this part of the street.” The only reason to oppose it, he maintained, “would be to declare the absolute authority of the past”—to declare that “everything old is sacred and untouchable and no place at all exists for our time.” “The world has changed,” Antonios goes on, explaining why a “popular” department store is no longer plausible in central Paris. “The problem with grands magasins is the cost of property and personnel, the cost of human resources. The only way to afford those is to make a luxury store. The classic discount stores, the ‘good buy’ stores—they don’t exist anymore. They can’t.” One of the oddities of the moment is that most Parisians, particularly ones who are hyper-aware of urbanist issues, tend to be merely dismissive of the love locks, even as the locks threaten to pull bridges down into the water and onto the heads of the tourists passing by in boats below. When Le Monde noticed the hard-to-miss pairing at the bridge, it characterized the opposition to the glass façade as a potential tragedy, Paris once again losing out on an architectural advance, with the locks on the bridge more farcical, confronted, quixotically, by “two New York women now settled in Paris.” “We can’t be repressive in the City of Love,” Bruno Julliard, the first deputy mayor of Paris, blithely announced not long ago, speaking of the love locks. “It’s an image problem concerning the tourists. It may be best just to wait until the fashion passes.” This kind of indifference makes it hard for the two American campaigners, Lisa Anselmo and Lisa Taylor-Huff, to keep their equanimity when you meet them on the Pont des Arts. When they see lock sellers brazenly offering locks to dim-witted tourists, they almost go crazy. The bridge has become even uglier, as the city government, to protect against more love locks, has hurriedly placed plywood panels in front of the railings, while the plywood panels, in turn, are spray-painted with graffiti, recalling to a New Yorker the interiors of subway cars in the early eighties. The two Lisas, the “two New York women” Le Monde refers to, spent their childhoods in New Jersey, and, far from being just currently settled in Paris, see themselves as settled Parisians. They have been leading the fight against the love locks for almost a year. They run a Web site called Nolovelocks.com (it’s called that in French, too) and started a petition that has collected ten thousand signatures. By the strangest of chances, they knew each other as teen-agers thirty years ago, in New Jersey. “We met doing a play,” Lisa Anselmo explains. “We’re both sort of theatre . . .” “Theatre junkies,” Lisa Taylor-Huff adds. “Theatre gals. We met doing a play in New Jersey. I think I was still in high school.” “Yeah, I was twenty and you were about sixteen.” They both laugh. They then lost touch, until they rediscovered each other, ten years ago, first as lovers of Paris, then as newly minted residents. Lisa Anselmo is more stylish, and has the glossy mane of every other woman one sees eating lunch on the ninth floor at Barney’s. Lisa Taylor-Huff is more mature-seeming—not long after her arrival in Paris, she married a Frenchman, met through a Parisian dating network, and is now a stepmother to his three children. The two women’s motives for moving to Paris were, and remain, as mixed and mysterious as such motives always are. They came for the “life style” and the literary possibilities, though both are more narrowly banded than in centuries past—not absinthe and the avant-garde but friends and croissants and blogs and cafés. Buy the print » It is not entirely a self-sustaining emotion. Like many Americans with dreams of Paris who confront Paris, they have found that they are living in a grouchy, heavily overadministered country, where everyone is socialized to be negative in the first instance, and where the small details of life are made as wrenchingly difficult as possible—though no more for newcomers than they are for the natives, which, of course, helps account for their grouchiness. They wish the French had the same investment in Frenchness that they do. Theirs is actually larger, being chosen, while that of the French is merely passive. “We both are powerhouse gals who have marketing backgrounds,” Lisa Anselmo says. “I’m a creative director as well, but what would be more complicated for some people was common nature for us. “In the beginning, we took a lot of heat,” she adds. “It was brutal, the hate mail and the bad language. We would take turns weeping. And they would come at us on our individual blogs and attack us.” “ ‘Oh, Americans always sticking their noses into other people’s business,’ ” the other Lisa says. “And from Americans, too. ‘Americans are always inserting themselves into places they don’t belong’—and I’m thinking, Well, isn’t that what putting a lock there is doing?” “It took adjusting what we said in interviews to start making it clear that yes, we’re Americans, but we live here, we pay taxes, my husband is French.” Practitioners routinely speak of the love locks as a Parisian tradition that goes back five hundred years. In fact, the locks were probably the spawn of a 2006 Italian romance, “I Want You,” which presents a scene of locking and shackling and throwing. Despite all the campaigning that the Lisas have done, and the ten thousand signatures on the online petition—despite appearances on LCI, the French CNN, and interviews with Le Figaro and Libération—the thing goes on: “The Kardashians did it on their show! Basketball wives did it on their show!” “It’s a disease that’s infecting the great cities of the world,” Lisa Taylor–Huff reflects later, over a glass of Lillet at a café in the courtyard of the Louvre. “Paris is also a museum, but it’s still a living museum. People live here, we have our lives here, we’re educating our kids here, they want to be able to go out in the public spaces. We’re raising a bunch, and when I think of my husband’s three kids—two of them are in university now and one is still just in middle school—what kind of future are they going to have if all their public spaces and their heritage are destroyed and degraded because of tourism? Why are we selling out to tourism?” The two Lisas’ vociferousness is produced partly by the perpetual immigrant’s need to prove that she is not merely a newcomer but has transferred allegiances even more passionately, along with residence—the same syndrome that, in its darker corners, made the Italian-Corsican Napoleon the most passionate Frenchman alive. If you were born within sight of the Pont des Arts and see it ruined, you merely change your route; there are lots of other bridges to cross. And then every city with mass tourism makes an implicit compact with tourists, which involves certain territorial concessions. No New Yorker would be really indignant to hear of an insult to the urban fabric at the South Street Seaport. Changing the Guard at Buckingham Palace is a moving and entertaining ritual, and the Tower of London a fascinating historical citadel. No real Londoner would be caught dead near either. Mass tourism doesn’t just overcharge its locales; it devours its objects. Our conversion experience to cities inevitably alienates us from the thing that first converted us. The two Lisas have a partial sense of this irony. If Parisians, or Venetians, tried to distinguish between mere tourists and true travellers and adopted visitors, they would never stop. Better to make two lumps—Them and Us, and stick to the Us places while surrendering the Them spots. Where the people who put up love locks insist that people have always been putting up love locks, Parisians pretend that the Pont des Arts is the kind of place you would always have wanted to avoid because it attracted the kind of people who put up love locks. What drives those who oppose the new Samaritaine, even as they mostly ignore the love locks? The absolute authority of the past? Or a distaste for putting a luxury hotel for rich transients in place of an old department store for middle-class Parisians? Alexandre Gady is the president of the chief institutional opponent of the project, the century-old and grandly named Société pour la Protection des Paysages et de l’Esthétique de la France. From the society’s magazine—it is filled with decorous views of the French countryside primly bordered by dated typography—one would expect an old French reactionary of a specific predictable sort: gray-suited, silver-haired, with matching metal-rimmed glasses, a decoration in his buttonhole, and a fierce, intelligent suspicion in his eyes of America, the modern and meretricious. In fact, Gady, only forty-six, is perhaps the preëminent historian of Paris of his generation—with books and articles on the evolution of the Marais and the social life of Place des Victoires, and the top position in architectural history at Paris IV, the old Sorbonne. He is open-collared and good-humored. Like the two Lisas and, indeed, Mme. Antonios, he came to his love for Paris from elsewhere—though his elsewhere was a nearby industrial village. “Can you believe it?” he says. “I grew up a few kilometres away, and throughout my childhood I never came to Paris. Not once. Oh, exactly once—with my school, on a big bus to see the Louvre museum! My mother hated Paris. She had a phobia about the crowds and the cars. It is bizarre. I resemble a provincial of the nineteenth century who discovered Paris—except that I came not from Toulouse but from a few kilometres away.” Over lunch in a café in the Seventh Arrondissement, he is relaxed and smiling and immediately assents to the notion that Paris risks becoming “Venetian” if it resists new building; he agrees that some of the most successful examples of urbanism in modern Parisian history—the Eiffel Tower and the Beaubourg are two—were seen as discordantly avant-garde when they began. What is it, exactly, that he, and the organization he leads, objects to? First, there is, as he cheerfully admits, something logical and vocational about the protest: basically, a society like his is supposed to oppose projects like this one. If it was his métier to support such projects, he would. But his real objections involve a complicated argument about the history of Paris. It’s an argument that would touch the edge of perversity if it were not so beautifully articulated, at length, as paradox. It is that any energy spent on renovating, improving, or changing inner Paris is merely a diversion from the real needs of the city. It is not just that the wrong side may win the argument. It is the wrong argument to be having. “That’s the heart of the problem,” Gady says. “As a historian, I need to have a long-term vision, and the problem with France is that it’s a country that loves history but has a very weak historical memory—and its élites, in particular, are mediocre, in the sense that they have no capacity for projection, for seeing what’s happened or what’s coming. The major problem for Paris is the exhaustion of land. Paris is one of the most ancient capitals in the world, after Rome. We have a dense history that’s very, very old—and, what’s more, intimately linked to the construction of the nation-state of France. The Capetians chose Paris as a capital, even though the secret truth is that Paris was never a very good choice for a capital. It’s much too far north—the Germans got here twice in fifteen days! But in the twelfth century, in the Middle Ages, when Rome was a mediocre village, Paris was already a university town and an industrial center. At its height, it had three hundred thousand inhabitants—that’s bigger than any city in France today, save five! It was a populated, extremely densely occupied city. Travellers wrote then that it was dangerous to cross the streets because of the traffic! “And here’s the central thing—the city has never really grown. Paris is a very tiny surface, and that’s the core secret of it. Los Angeles—well, try to walk that city on foot. Berlin, too, a city of gigantic blocks. In the nineteenth century, at the moment when Berlin and London and New York acted by annexing the suburbs and smaller cities around them, we turned inward—we concentrated on the Paris of the center. And so Paris—it’s beautiful. But it’s a doll’s house! And that’s one reason the Parisian élite is so conservative. They live in the doll’s house. They go to the same schools—in the center of Paris. They live in the same apartments—in the center of Paris. The Élysée Palace, the Hôtel Matignon are in the center. So all they see is that. The blindness of the élites is to reproduce a model of returning to the center, always back to the center, and that’s a model that can’t be maintained.” This, in his view, is the true evil of the Samaritaine project. “Once again, we see the same fundamental error—we’ll treat central Paris as a bijou, and let it be surrounded by these dubious zones we call the banlieues with people we don’t much like. I know what the banlieues are—I live in one of them.” Gady has built up to his real provocation. It is not that we should be doing this or that—we should not be doing anything in central Paris. Not that it is a bad plan in itself, but any plan devoted to central Paris is a bad plan, a diversion from the need of the city to grow outward. “La Samaritaine is a choice for the hyper-luxe in a hyper-central neighborhood, decorated with a gesture of architecture.” And then, he says, there are the rules: “It’s a quartier entirely protected by law—I didn’t make it so; the state did—entirely protected, architecturally finished, with no space and strict rules. And if you or I asked to do what L.V.M.H. wants to, we’d be told, ‘Sorry, sir, it’s forbidden.’ ” One almost has the sense that Gady would be content to see La Samaritaine remain shuttered—sooner, at least, than see it become one more glittering gewgaw in the doll’s house. “Paris, central Paris, is a finished city,” he says, meaning one not in need of improvement—but also, perhaps, one without a plausible future. A finished city, polished to a gloss, is also a finished city, incapable of new experience. He strongly suspects, in any case, that though he and the preservationists have won the first skirmish they will lose the war. “We’ll see what happens, but L.V.M.H. . . .” He trails off. Asked about the love locks, Gady shakes his head. “They’re hideous,” he says. “But there the solution is so easy! Just get rid of the metal grilles and replace them with plaques”—smooth panels to which no lock can be attached. He shrugs, unaware that the two Lisas have been fighting for this simple solution for a year, to no avail. The love locks, for Gady, seem part of the same density of inner Paris that magnetically draws in tourists as it does politicians; the overloading of the bridge is just a kind of poor man’s version of the overloading of the entire area. Inner Paris has been polished to a point of hyper-attractiveness, whether in a luxe form meant to draw oligarchs to the five-star hotels there (after yesterday’s five-star hotel in Dubai and before tomorrow’s five-star hotel in London) or in the kitsch form exemplified by the groaning weight of tourist relics. Central Paris has become not a window onto the world but a vitrine with exhibits inside, some fine, some squalid, all finished. As if by some principle of civic equilibrium, while Mme. Antonios waits patiently on the Left Bank for the government to decide whether L.V.M.H. can or cannot have its vast, seven-story glass curtain, the city government stripped away the locks from one section of the bridge and ceded to the two Lisas and their French followers three small test panels of glass, three feet by five feet each, for the Pont des Arts. The three experimental panels make it almost impossible to attach a lock, and each has different qualities of scratch resistance and durability. The new glass panneaux, or windows, are there only as a tentative experiment. “Just seeing those new panels, just to have that view restored, it’s hard not to break into tears,” Lisa Anselmo says. “And you can sit on the bench and look at those panels and feel like you can look at the Eiffel Tower and it looks the way it’s supposed to!” Lisa Taylor-Huff agrees. All over Paris right now, there are posters for the French singer Véronique Sanson, advertising concerts of songs from what are called, portentously, “Les Années Americaines”—her American years. It is fair to say that no American has any idea that Véronique had American years—although she did, and was married to Stephen Stills for a little while. It doesn’t matter. The idea of her Americanness appeals to Parisians, as the abstract idea of becoming Parisian appeals to Americans. To become some other thing, you have to not be that thing in the first place, and, if you are that thing, then it is hard for you to really believe that anyone else can become it, since the essence of the thing is having been it all along. La Samaritaine, now no longer quite part of Paris, cannot be returned to Paris as a luxury hotel. Two powerhouse New Jersey gals from marketing backgrounds can save the bridge from the love locks—but the French are skeptical that they can restore it to Paris, and the bridge has to be restored to Paris, made part of the Parisian sense of Us, before it can be returned to Paris. Historians in France like to say that when lieux de mémoires, places of memory, are in conflict they become inflamed; the truth is that when sites are in conflict they mostly disappear from view. They get covered over by hoardings, and shame and scaffolding, locked to alien loves. The view through the three tentatively installed glass panneaux not only briefly removes the visual noise of the love locks but, in its serenity, restores the innocence of the view, so that everything once again seems simply Parisian, and the people in the boats going by below less like endangered tourists corralled into movable pens and more like pilgrims to the medieval city, seeking its grace. Glass is clear. "
The New Yorker,L,A Risky Novel of Seduction and Betrayal,"

 

Harvey, in excavating a love triangle, explores the strange elasticity of time. 
Credit Illustration by Riccardo Vecchio									 


The odds are powerfully stacked against Samantha Harvey’s third novel, “Dear Thief” (Atavist): sometimes you feel that the author has enjoyed building a trembling wall of them. Her novel takes the form of a long letter, written by a woman in middle age, to her childhood friend, and so most of the narration languishes in the corridor of the second-person singular. The friend (the “thief” of the book’s title) disappeared a decade and a half ago, and so the narrator does much reminiscing, with the danger that the novel drifts fairly often into the pressureless zones of retrospect. And the narrator’s lost friend was a “character,” a large personality remembered, with loathing and love, for her enigmatic singularity: so, most perilously, Harvey’s novel must work to convince us that this vague “you” of the narrator’s letter deserves her extravagant reputation and the time spent recalling her. The book is sometimes precious or whimsical, and can be frustratingly diaphanous. It has nerves of silk; it could probably do with more robustness, and a bit of comedy. But “Dear Thief” is a beautiful, tentative success, a novel with no interest in conformity. Harvey’s book is propelled not by the usual structures of novel writing but by the quality of its author’s mind, by the luminousness of her prose, and by an ardent innocence of speculation that is rare in contemporary fiction. We follow Harvey’s narrator, as she pushes her way through her novel-size letter, because we can see that she has somewhere to go, and because we sense that she is trying to figure out exact answers to wide questions. It is a strange and exhilarating journey, unlike anything I have recently encountered.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } You can get an idea of the novel’s rich peculiarity from its first sentence, which will strike some readers as fey or arch, but which its narrator (who remains nameless) offers quite matter-of-factly: “In answer to a question you asked a long time ago, I have, yes, seen through what you called the gauze of this life.” The narrator replies to her old friend’s remembered question by telling us about the night her grandmother died, during the long, hot English summer of 1976, when the narrator was twenty-four. Within a paragraph or two, the reader senses an attentive purity in the narrator’s prose. She seems alert to everything: the “feathered breaths” of her grandmother, how her “exhales were smooth and liquid, which seems to me now the surest sign of a life’s exit—when the act of giving away air is easier than that of accepting it”; the way the dying woman’s skin has “flattened a tone—and I mean it this way, like a piece of music gone off-key.” The scene and the location are somewhat magical. The grandmother’s house is by the Thames, very east in the city, near the Isle of Dogs, and not far from the point at which the river, wide now, becomes the sea—“a thousand pale horses frothing at the bit.” To pass the time, the narrator wanders down to the river, where she finds a collection of bones on the shore; when she returns, she discovers, as she expected to, that her grandmother has died, and feels this end to be calm and right. She suffers no grief, because “life as I’d always known it shows itself now as only the negative space made by a much vaster reality.” She thinks of her grandmother, “fundamental and as still as a root,” and it seems senseless to say that she is dead, “just as senseless as it is to say I myself am alive.” In this respect, the narrator says, she has seen through the gauze of this life. It’s a risky way to begin a novel, to throw us head first into death and sententiousness, metaphysics and nameless characters (the grandmother has no further role in the book). But Harvey’s novel proceeds in this spirit of continual lawlessness. The “gauze of this life” is just the kind of phrase, we learn, that the narrator’s friend would use—challenging, glamorously pretentious, annoying, at once acute and vague. The two women grew up together in the English countryside, in Shropshire. The narrator’s friend is named Nina, though she is here nicknamed Butterfly, because, one supposes, she is lovely, and comes and goes in apparently random flights. Butterfly is one of those people whose role on earth is to be talked about. As the narrator gradually reveals, her strange friend stood out in the England of their nineteen-sixties childhood (“this mannered land that was too small for you”): a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania who was brought to England as a baby; an androgynous beauty, with a strong nose and narrow hips; languorous, dangerous, self-absorbed, brilliant, mystical (she liked quoting from the Upanishads). When she was younger, Butterfly showed little interest in men, and would respond to their overtures with a placid “Thank you, no,” and the lighting of a cigarette. When they mocked her and called her a “dyke,” she would dumbfoundingly quote Lorca at them: “Poetry was your only response to anything they did or said and you used it as wastefully as somebody emptying a cartridge into grey sky. The poems would leave indents of silence, like hammer marks on metal.” She had an air of “magnificent poverty.” She “looked out of place almost anywhere substantial.” She was mercurial. One day, she might seem pale and plain, “and we leave you alone in the veil of smoke that makes you look like a sullen bride, bored at her own wedding table.” On another, she has painted her eyelids purple or orange, or is wearing a man’s purple trousers. For her twenty-first birthday, she was given a cream-colored shawl, and seems not to have taken it off for the next decade. When the narrator last saw her friend, in 1986, she was still wearing it, but it was dirty and torn in one place, so that the white of Butterfly’s shoulder came through, “like some fallen rampart,” betraying “a loss of dignity far greater than if you had stood naked in public.” if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }People who get talked about, who are remembered as “figures,” tend to be memorable either for some large achievement or for scandalously doing nothing very much—for just being. Butterfly falls into the second category, and Harvey, again setting herself a difficult task, skillfully captures the friend’s enraging passivity. Was she selfish? No, the narrator says; she might have been fundamentally selfless, “by which I mean somebody who lies low like a card in a pack, until the cards are dealt.” There are cards that are good news and cards that are bad news, but Butterfly was neither intrinsically good nor bad. “She is just offered up, and played or not.” “Think of it as one less thing to worry about.”Buy the print » It is this terrible “neutrality” to which the narrator returns again and again, and which provides the novel’s catalyst. The narrator, who is around fifty and is writing this letter in 2001 and 2002, remembers a woman who could never quite be grasped—she would disappear and emerge years later, and give no coherent account of where she had been. She left England, or so it appears, in 1973, when she was twenty-one, and turned up at the narrator’s house nine years later, asking if she could stay for a month or two. The narrator was now living with a husband, Nicolas, and a young son, Teddy. (After a spell in London, they had moved back to the countryside that she grew up in.) They take Butterfly in, of course, and she stays for three years. Butterfly’s failure to explain or apologize is characteristic. Less expected, perhaps, are the needle marks on her arm. Butterfly has become a committed, if discreetly functional, drug-taker. And something else happens during her three-year visit, something Harvey has been slyly preparing, with various hints, a vague sense of unease, and the slow revelation of the narrator’s possessive anger. Butterfly worms her way into her friend’s marriage and breaks it up. The passive-aggressive insinuation culminates in a scene in Spain, when the narrator catches her friend and her husband having sex, a rare moment of narrative conventionality in the book (which is not necessarily the weaker for it). Earlier, less conventionally, in a passage of subtle indirection, the narrator first realized what was afoot. Butterfly is walking with her friend; she is wearing Nicolas’s cast-off trousers, and the narrator is surprised by how well they fit her. Always ready with an opinion, Butterfly announces, in her airy and pretentious way, that religions have trinities because “a triangle is the holiest and most elegant of things; with two lines you can only create two lines, but with three you can create a shape. That is why three is a transformative number.” It is the moment when the narrator, always weirdly tolerant of her friend, first feels threatened and outmaneuvered: “You were going to work your way into my marriage and you were going to call its new three-way shape holy, and I, pinned like a snared bird to one corner of a triangle, would have to watch it happen.” (Harvey has said that her novel is indebted to Leonard Cohen’s song “Famous Blue Raincoat,” also about a love triangle, and also written as a letter to the person responsible for the marital destruction.) This breakage is at the heart of the book, and explains not only the narrator’s obsessive involvement in her lost friend but also, perhaps, Butterfly’s long disappearance. Yet Harvey is less interested in the dramatic formula of betrayal than in making use of the novel’s essayistic form to range widely, sometimes concretely, sometimes abstractly. She has been compared to Virginia Woolf, but I was at moments reminded of Marilynne Robinson, particularly of the near-pedagogical or sermonizing rhetoric of “Housekeeping.” Harvey, who was born in Kent in 1975, has a degree in philosophy, and you sense a continuous pressure of intellectual inquiry, in sentences that are rich but always lucid. As in her exquisite first novel, “The Wilderness” (2009), which is narrated by a man who is suffering from Alzheimer’s, Harvey explores the strange elasticity of time, and our relation to it: how we might carelessly let years go by without self-assertion or resistance; how we wantonly reshape the past; how we live too much in the past (and yet never enough to satisfy us, because it has so painfully gone). The narrator is fascinated by Butterfly’s canny passivity, but she is also bewildered by her own. Once she saw what was coming, why did she do nothing to stop it? Was it because she was foolishly tolerant, or because she knew that she was witnessing her friend’s steady downfall? (Wherever Butterfly now is, she is not there with Nicolas: the two were barely together as lovers.) And what of her own downfall—why did she acquiesce in that, colluding in her own loneliness? (She has been separated from Nicolas for fifteen years, and doesn’t appear to see a great deal of her grownup son.) The narrator now works in a nursing home, which forces her to reflect on the shape a life takes, on everything that is evidently beyond our control. She doesn’t understand time, she insists, which is to say that she doesn’t really understand life: You would think that living is a kind of scholarship in time, and that the longer we live the more expert we become at coping with it, in the way that, if you play tennis enough, you get used to coping with faster and faster serves. Instead I find that the longer I live the more bemused I become, and the more impenetrable the subject shows itself to be. I sit on a heap of days. Sitting on her heap of days (a wonderfully Biblical image), she goes back in time, she recollects, and, in a striking inversion of the usual wisdom, phrased with Harvey’s wistful elegance, she posits that the past is where our true potential lies: There is freedom there; there is always freedom in the past. The self you left behind lives in endless possibility. The older you get, the bigger and wilder the past becomes, a place that can never again be tended and which is therefore prone to that loveliness that happens on wastelands and wildernesses, where grass has grown over scrap metal and wheat has sprung up in cracks between concrete and there is no regular shape for the light to fall flat on, so it vaults and multiplies and you want to go there. You want to go there like you want to go to a lover. This runs the risk of making “Dear Thief” sound more abstract, or just more essayistic, than it is. One of the regular rewards of its prose is its careful attention to the world—from the “reproachful magnetism” between two tango dancers to the way a snowflake lands on a windowpane, “in that ludicrous wet collapse that removes all the mystery.” Harvey exactly sketches a Spanish bullfight—the moment, near the end, when bull and matador recognize each other, and then the moment when that mutual animal recognition is destroyed: “When the bull finally realizes that the man is cruel, there is no longer recognition. The bull is not cruel; why does the man have to be. . . . The bull staggers and drops like a rock into its short shadow, and is dragged away to music.” There is a transporting description of fishing for mussel pearls in the Scottish Highlands: “Often in the Highlands the very early mornings are clear and blue and then become gradually duller as if, I always thought, our human presence clouded the landscape like breath clouds glass.” Harvey’s rarity can be found in that last sentence, in her ability to move from the ordinary to the speculative, her dance to and from the metaphysical. There is steady pleasure and consolation in this for the reader, if not reliably for the book’s troubled characters. Even as it tells its tale of determinism and fatality, this remarkable novel asserts its own curious freedoms. "

Olena Kalytiak Davis writes poetry that can be at once tawdry and oddly pure. 
Credit Illustration by Patrick Morgan									 


The poet Olena Kalytiak Davis’s new book, her third, is “The Poem She Didn’t Write and Other Poems.” The title echoes, even as it undermines, an old formula that seems to have gone out of favor: Eliot’s “The Waste Land and Other Poems,” Yeats’s “The Green Helmet and Other Poems,” Ginsberg’s “Howl and Other Poems,” Plath’s “The Colossus and Other Poems” all come readily to mind, along with many slim but stately volumes before them. These titles conjure a world in which poetry was a game played across the ages, masterpiece versus masterpiece. The struggle was dynastic; the combatants were male, unless, like Plath, they had internalized (in Plath’s case, tragically) the patrilineal rules for advancement. Anthologies were printed and syllabi distributed, and so the canon was formed. Poets live casually among masterpieces of their art. The volume of Stevens propping up the window, the translation of Catullus serving as a coaster, the waterlogged Dickinson: these are features of any writer’s environment, and the thought of joining them both inspires and blocks. And so Davis’s submissions to the canon are anti-submissions; her title poem fantasizes a work that “wasn’t / influenced by homer or blake or yeats” and “contained no anxiety” and “hadn’t even heard of / louise glück franz wright billy (budd) collins.” The poem she didn’t write isn’t “The Poem She Didn’t Write”: of that imagined, nonexistent poem, Davis informs us that she “did not read [it] to anyone” and “did not send it out ‘for publication.’ ” That poem preëmpts its own rejection by never existing in the first place; it is the recessive version of Davis’s canonical aspirations, whose namesake will carry its torch.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } Davis’s professed unworthiness is one of many tricky manifestations of her ambition. She is the rare poet who has made underproduction an aspect of her glamour. Since 1997, she has published only two full-length books and a chapbook, whose contents are reprinted here. The poems can be tawdry, but any art so fixated on its imperfections comes off as weirdly pure. Maybe some of this is geographical. Poets on the usual coasts can keep themselves busy inside the panopticon, never far from a bar reading or a teaching gig. Davis, who was born in 1963, in Detroit, to Ukrainian parents, has for years lived in and around Anchorage, Alaska, where she works as an attorney. From the evidence of her poems, she is a single mother who drives—or once drove—“a 1995 red toyota 4-runner with racing stripe,” listens to loud Dylan on the way to pick up her kids, falls in and out of love, and, above all, reads. The poems are paved with outbursts and literary touchstones. They feel like quickies, rough liaisons where “sex meets books,” sometimes, as in “Francesca Says More,” unhappily: that maiden thump was book on floor, but does it really matter who kissed who first or then who decided to go further? lower? faster? naturally, we took turns on top. now here, now there, and up and down…once it started no one even thought to think to stop. so, we have holes inside our souls, but mustn’t we begin by filling others’? god gave us lips and hands and parts that cannot possibly be saved for prayer. nor by. i will not name name, claim fame by how well or who i fucked or why, it happens all the time. and it’s you, white pilgrim, whom next galehot seeks.   fuck. we didn’t read again for weeks.  The speaker is a contemporary version of Dante’s tragic heroine Francesca, condemned to suffer in Hell with her lover, Paolo. The form—a form that Dante helped to invent—is the sonnet, here reduced to its rudiments: fourteen lines, a rumor of pentameter, a tart couplet at the close. The poem, one of Davis’s many “shattered sonnets,” as she has called them, draws these lines in order to color outside of them; her small “i” isn’t so much an homage to Cummings as it is a nod to text messages and Gchat, forms of written communication that operate under the conditions of instantaneousness previously reserved for speech. It was reading about the romance of Lancelot and Guinevere, as Dante tells us, that got Francesca in trouble to begin with; it was reading Francesca’s story about the dangers of reading that resulted in the book’s “maiden thump” as it was unceremoniously kicked off the bed and replaced by the book Davis wrote. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }“The Poem She Didn’t Write” is a breakup book, full of the kinds of invective and taunts honed by a person who has spent, as all of us have now spent, infinite hours online. Its complex tones arise from the poet’s wanting equally to seduce and to repel a lover whose deepening silence only provokes rhetorical escalation. The effect can be like reading e-mails in someone’s drafts folder—but who wouldn’t want to read Davis’s drafts? “Do you know how many men would paykilldie / for me to suck their cock? fuck,” she writes, leaving the triple verb just as it is, as though waiting for the finished missive to make the choice. Power, especially sexual power; the pleasures and risks of debasement; candor and the fakery that passes for it; wildness and the social vacuum it shatters—these are Davis’s preoccupations. Sex displaces reading, kicking the book off the bed. But, just as often, reading, by providing one kinky scenario after another, displaces sex, as in “Robert Lowell”: The dream, I don’t remember how it went, For I don’t really dream or count or know Why Robert Lowell: the only poet shade sent To acknowledge my cool ambition, light my cigarette.  The poem seems angled for stateliness, with its regular meters and debonair rhymes. Lowell, who more or less invented confessional poetry, is, of course, the very model of male charisma and its excesses. But things rapidly, thrillingly unravel. In the next stanza, Davis is a sexy shambles, her T-shirt emblazoned with a phrase from Lowell’s late poem “Epilogue”: This is the decade of aughts and oughts And I am still naught. I am forty. In a tight T‑shirt over my small ignoble breasts reading: “ALL’S MISALLIANCE.”  Lowell’s patents are everywhere (“These are the tranquilized fifties / and I am forty,” he writes, in “Memories of West Street and Lepke”), though Davis’s adaptations gut and rebuild them: a woman who is “forty” in the two-thousands is “naught” in the decade of “aughts and oughts.” The poem drifts from its altitudes down into the scuffed, actual life it briefly sought to transcend. What makes Davis’s work exciting is the feeling it conveys of being “full-famished. / Famished-full,” an emotional state with aesthetic ramifications: it sends us ricocheting from line to line and poem to poem looking for sustenance. Here’s reason to think that authentic pining in poetry, though hard to come by, is probably necessary for any poet who wishes to become classic. Davis’s successive impulses, often cancelling one another, imply a poem full of fresh starts summarily abandoned, as in “The Lyric ‘I’ Drives to Pick Up Her Children from School: A Poem in the Postconfessional Mode.” The title mocks the language of M.L.A. panels and doctoral theses: if this “lyric ‘I’ ” is, as the theory heads say, a construct, a fiction, what’s it doing wearing “her tight jeans, her big boots, her puffy parka”? “i” feels the power of being a single mom in a red truck. “i” knows it is not enough power. “i” thinks “i am the man, i suffered, i was there”. “i” is almost broke, but “i” thinks “i live more in a continuous present that i enjoy”. “i” thinks “amor fati”. “i” notices the chugach mountains. “i” notices the chugach mountains sometimes look good and sometimes bad. “i” remembers that yesterday the chugach mountains looked desolate and dirty and roadblocky. “i” notices the chugach mountains look particularly beautiful today covered in sun and snow. “i” almost thinks “bathed in sun and snow” but stops herself. “i” feels that “i” can maybe find, really start, really finish her sex poem tomorrow.  When you say these lines aloud, you become the “I,” just as Davis, repeating Whitman’s lines, becomes “the man” who can say “I suffered, I was there”; and yet you also experience the jolt of disagreement between subject and verb, since “I” is here treated as third person. The effect is more like being an actor in a play, moved by the gusts of emotion that move your character, than like being a member of the audience. This discomfiting proximity, this unsought intimacy, is the fundamental pleasure of poetry. Davis’s poems plunge us right into the heart of it. The medium of poetry isn’t language, really; it’s human loneliness, a loneliness that poets, having received it themselves from earlier poets, transfer to their readers. Like bees in a honeycomb, writers and readers experience isolation and solitude communally and collaboratively. This is what Harold Bloom speaks of when, in a remark that Davis quotes, he says that poets create an “otherness” such that loneliness is “created and alleviated at once.” Writing a poem, you create that vivid otherness; reading one, you re-create it in your own person. These two lonely souls, writer and reader, are bound to one another. They can be miles or centuries apart, but in Davis’s book the passage between them sees some heavy traffic. Her final poem, a single couplet called “Threshold,” invites us to cross it: “what i should of softly sweetly surely said: / ‘o wingèd boy, come read with me in bed.’ ” "
The New Yorker,L,Tables for Two: Turntable Retro Bar & Restaurant Mad for Chicken,"

We need to talk about chicken. Not the buttermilk-crusted crags and crevices of the South but the Korean variety: smooth, with a slight shimmer, resembling a lunar landscape, or at least what the moon looks like from Earth. Amid a crowded field in the shadow of the Empire State Building, there’s a particularly fine rendition of Korean fried chicken at the lavishly named Turntable Retro Bar & Restaurant Mad for Chicken, part of a mini-chain that originated in Flushing. Like many of Koreatown’s best establishments, it’s on the second floor of a bleak office building. After eight, a d.j. in a glass booth makes his presence known, loudly, to all the restaurant’s customers, many of whom have enthusiastically embraced the truth that fried chicken is a drunk food par excellence. If that’s the route you’d like to take, do not let the long list of signature Martinis distract you. One of them—the Earl Gray Twist—comes with a Mighty Leaf teabag awkwardly dangling off the side; another, the Blueberry Martini, lists sour mix as an ingredient. When the most drinkable of the cocktails is made with Cognac (Men in Cognac, which sounds like a misandrist’s excellent revenge plot), it’s an indicator that soju or beer is best. There are plenty of other things to avoid, too: undercooked kimchi pancakes, a “Mexican-style” appetizer of mozzarella-covered corn, tables of men with rolled-up shirtsleeves ordering shots and talking about a bungee-jumping video they posted on Facebook. And although the menu has all the Korean dishes Americans might expect, none are exceptional.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } After everyone’s poked their chopsticks around in a dish of reliably chewy rice cakes with bulgogi, the chicken is eaten swiftly and in silence—or as quietly as possible when it’s oldies night and the d.j.’s got to the sotto-voce part of “Total Eclipse of the Heart.” There are many reasons why Korean fried chicken is such a superbly satisfying eating experience. Fingers aren’t spoiled, because the sauce is lightly brushed on, and only after the chicken is cooked. The meat remains juicy, because the bird is cooked at a lower temperature than its American brethren. The chicken is dipped in a very finely ground flour, and, as a result, the shell is paper-thin, almost translucent; it is pierced, not shattered, on first bite. Because the skin and flesh are cooked evenly, the disconcerting layer of fat in between is exorcised. Although Turntable offers a soy-and-garlic sauce, the hot and spicy is the main event, with a slow and subtle burn. A plate of wings with a side of pickled daikon radish is the ideal mix of salty and sour, crunchy and chewy. Human tastebuds are powerless against such a deeply addictive sequence. All there is to do is add soju, and repeat. "
The New Yorker,L,The Wu-Tang Clan’s “A Better Tomorrow”,"

 

No other hip-hop group has had such a combination of the dodgy concept called street cred and unapologetically poetic, emotional writing.

The most surprising thing about “A Better Tomorrow,” the latest album from New York’s Wu-Tang Clan, is not that it is generally strong but that the fractious nine-person group ended up making any kind of recording together at all. For its previous studio album, “8 Diagrams” (2007), Wu-Tang Clan ended up touring without its founder, the RZA, who had produced most of the album. RZA, meanwhile, conducted a solo tour of his own, at the same time. By doing more visible work, including writing soundtracks for Quentin Tarantino, RZA had alienated his own group. As he told me, referring to Raekwon, a core member of the clan, “He said I was a hip-hop hippie with a guitar.” Hippie tag aside, this isn’t unfair. RZA said that he wrote many of the tracks for “A Better Tomorrow” on guitar, first, later voicing the compositions with samples or other instruments. But the Wu still mostly sounds like the Wu, and a newcomer who has never encountered the most famous band from Staten Island would do fine to start here. The Wu-Tang Clan’s long career mirrors the comic books and kung-fu flicks that its members grew up loving: colorful and intense, and longer on respect than on widespread mainstream acceptance. Like cheap Canal Street mixtapes and kung-fu DVDs, Wu-Tang has never had enormous commercial success, even at the height of the CD era. In twenty years and five albums, the group has sold only a little more than six million records, according to Nielsen SoundScan.if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailTop"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""top"" ], collapse: true } ); } } Wu-Tang was formed in and around Staten Island’s public Stapleton and Park Hill Houses, in the late eighties, pulling in additional rappers who lived in Brooklyn. By 1992, a member named GZA had released an album, under the name the Genius, on Cold Chillin’ Records, and his cousin, the eventual bandleader RZA, had released a goofy single on Tommy Boy, as Prince Rakeem. But, in the early nineties, RZA plotted a new direction that drew on martial-arts epigrams (“Wu-Tang was the best sword style. And with us, our tongue is our sword,” he explains in “The Wu-Tang Manual”), chess strategy, and practices derived from the teachings of the Five Percent Nation, a group formed in 1963 by Clarence (13X) Smith, a student minister at the Nation of Islam’s Temple Number Seven, in Harlem. The band’s début, “Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers,” in 1993, fell into a category of hip-hop that has since been called “boom bap”: slow, aggressive drum samples matched with lyrical dexterity. But nothing was quite like Wu-Tang records. RZA’s production was dirtier and weirder than that of his peers, and he was teamed with an uncannily talented array of m.c.s with divergent styles. No other band has had such a combination of that dodgy cultural concept known as street cred—all its members are from rough neighborhoods, and most are veterans of jail stints—and unapologetically twisty, emotional, poetic writing. Wu-Tang Clan albums feel overloaded in every sense. Other groups, like Public Enemy, had complex, advanced aesthetics, but Wu-Tang Clan was the only one that could switch from discussing Eastern philosophy to telling stories about police harassment to debating the merits of different coats. Around the same time as Wu-Tang’s début, smoother sounds from the West Coast and the South took over the charts, and haven’t let go. But the Wu-Tang influence is now being heard in a new generation, with m.c.s like Action Bronson and Joey Bada$$, who are heavy on aggression and intricate wordplay, and uninterested in simple, chanted hooks. There’s no pretending that this is the same collection of rappers who entered the public consciousness with a thundering chain of threats and compressed drums, on the single “Protect Ya Neck.” “A Better Tomorrow” ventures into slightly obvious inspirational talk (“Never let go of your mind, it is a terrible thing to waste, to lose, but it’s very hard to find,” GZA raps, on “Never Let Go”); what sounds like an unironic sample of “Feelings,” on “Felt”; and, on “Miracle,” an invocation of familiar modern rock that has an unmiraculous effect. For most of the album, though, the band is typically prolix, haughty, and immersed in its own world of slang. There are live drums and other traces of RZA’s work as an m.c. and a producer outside hip-hop, with acts such as the Black Keys and James Blake, but nothing that will make you question whom you’re hearing. Indeed, the drum samples in the song “Pioneer the Frontier” were also used in “Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers.” There are snippets from kung-fu movies scattered throughout the album, a device that was RZA’s initial watermark as a producer. And although the group has been more flux than stasis in its career, every m.c. is as strong as he was twenty years ago. On “Mistaken Identity,” over a live band playing vaguely sinister funk, Method Man starts off a rattling sixteen-bar verse with an open acknowledgment of who’s on the playing field now: “Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back. I push your cap, before ninety-three, I pushed crack. I’m hood, black, you know me well, what’s good, scrap? I’m smoking rappers, you are a L—what’s good, Smack?” Pusha T is the well-known rapper who has worked with Kanye West, while Smack White is an underground battle rapper. if ( typeof CN !== ""undefined"" ) { if ( CN.dart ) {  CN.dart.call( ""yrailBottom"", { sz: ( CN.isMobile ? ""320x50"" : ""300x250"" ), kws: [ ""bottom"" ], collapse: true } ); } }“Crushed Egos” begins with a sample of a man saying, “You practiced twenty years? You must be extremely good, then.” And he is: Raekwon enters with a verse that sticks to his tradition of folding together phonemes and slang that sound better for lining up askew. He raps, “Restaurants with skeleton keys is big business. Well groomed and elegant, posture’s real dapper. Status is gigantic, coats is alpaca.” The verse reminds us that the solo albums of many of Wu-Tang’s members are stronger than some of the group efforts. Raekwon’s “Only Built 4 Cuban Linx . . .” (1995) is possibly the most complex of all the Wu albums. GZA’s “Liquid Swords” (1995) is the most coherent and fluid. Ghostface Killah’s “Supreme Clientele” (2000) is the most fun and unhinged. And then there’s the work of the m.c. whom Raekwon shouts out as Ason Unique, one of the names used by Ol’ Dirty Bastard, the band’s only casualty—he died in 2004. The rapper struggled with many antagonists, including the police, drugs, and himself. A new book called “The Dirty Version,” written by his constant companion, Buddha Monk, describes the continual state of tumult the rapper lived in, doling out money to friends and lovers and relatives, going AWOL for recording sessions, and generally not accepting that he was possibly the best-known Wu-Tang member. There have been few unexpected appearances as lovely as Dirty’s verse on Mariah Carey’s “Fantasy,” which created a bridge between unchecked lunacy and showroom optimism that nobody has been able to cross since. There is none of Dirty’s mania or gurgling on “A Better Tomorrow,” which is a bit defanged. That makes it a perfect primer; there are dozens of albums featuring this producer and these rappers, perhaps the richest catalogue of any single group in rap. The collective is responsible for more than forty albums, probably half of which are worth owning. That’s a pretty good average for a deeply disorganized bunch of people. If “A Better Tomorrow” does anything for you, go straight to yesterday. "
The Washington Post,L,Some thoughts on Eric Garner - The Washington Post," By Radley Balko December 4 at 9:56 AM  Follow @radleybalko      A 400- pound asthmatic Eric Garner died while being arrested by police in Staten Island. (Photo By: /NY Daily News via Getty Images)  Yesterday, a New York City officials announced that a grand jury had cleared the police officer captured on video putting Staten Island resident Eric Garner in a choke hold. Garner later died of a heart attack. The announcement sparked large protests throughout the city, and smaller protests across the country. A few varied thoughts on the incident: Body cameras My Washington Post colleague Nia-Malika Henderson wrote yesterday that the failure to indict the officer despite what appears to be some pretty damning video evidence strikes a blow against the use of body cameras. While I agree with Henderson that President Obama’s proposed police reforms don’t go nearly far enough, I don’t think her conclusion about body cameras is right. Body cameras are a form of government transparency. Though there is some evidence that they motivate better behavior in both cops and citizens, I don’t think most people who advocates their use would argue that they’d be a panacea in thwarting police misconduct. Instead, like other transparency policies, their primary function is to expose any problems that may exist. The video footage of the Eric Garner arrest has done exactly that.  The video showed that this cop used a level of force that to many people seems excessive. The video provided a neutral narrative of the arrest. If not for the video, we would be left only with the police account of the arrest versus the account of a few witnesses. And remember, the officers’ first report on the confrontation didn’t mention the chokehold. The video convinced people who might have otherwise sided with the police. Mediaite editor Andrew Kirell noted on Twitter yesterday that he was pleased to see so many conservatives and right-leaning people in his feed expressing outrage over the lack of an indictment. The video demonstrated that the system is broken. The lack of an indictment stunned many people because the video seemed so compelling. Because the grand jury nevertheless declined to indict, those people must now grapple with the fact that either the grand jury system is broken or New York’s use of force laws allow for what we saw in that video. That is, either the grand jury improperly applied the law to clear a cop, or the law itself is terribly flawed.  A number of people on social media have made the point that for black people, it was already obvious that the system is broken. But if you’re trying to build a coalition to change the laws, you need to convince the people who don’t already agree with you that the laws need changing. Yesterday’s protests were not only huge, they were diverse. That is, they included a lot of white people — people for whom the problems in the criminal justice system weren’t already obvious. Eric Garner’s death has convinced a lot of people that the laws need to be changed. It’s safe to say that the video is a big reason why.   Bad cops on the job The cop in question in the Garner case, Daniel Pantaleo, had twice been sued for violating a citizen’s constitutional rights. One lawsuit accused Pantaleo and other officers of illegally pulling over a car, falsely claiming to have found crack and forcing the car’s occupants to strip nude, squat, and cough. The city settled that lawsuit for $30,000. The other lawsuit is still pending. It accuses Pantaleo of misstating facts about a marijuana arrest in a case where there charges were later dismissed. This problem goes well beyond New York City. Abusive cops are notoriously difficult to fire. Even when they can be fired or forced to resign, they often quickly find work in another police agency. We give police officers extraordinary powers. They’re authorized to detain, arrest, injure, and kill. If anything, the laws and internal policies governing how cops are hired and retained should err on the side of exclusion. Instead, the laws are explicitly designed to make it difficult to exclude someone who may be mentally unfit for the job, and even more difficult to dismiss someone once they’ve actually demonstrated that they shouldn’t be trusted with a badge and a gun. On the same day the New York grand jury cleared Garner, for example, we learned this, via the Guardian: A police officer who shot a 12-year-old dead in a Cleveland park late last month had been judged unfit for police service two years earlier by a small suburban force where he worked for six months, according to records released on Wednesday. Officer Timothy Loehmann, who killed Tamir Rice on 22 November, was specifically faulted for breaking down emotionally while handling a live gun. During a training episode at a firing range, Loehmann was reported to be “distracted and weepy” and incommunicative. “His handgun performance was dismal,” deputy chief Jim Polak of the Independence, Ohio, police department wrote in an internal memo. The memo concludes with a recommendation that Loehmann be “released from the employment of the City of Independence”. Less than a week later, on 3 December 2012, Loehmann resigned. In March of this year, Loehmann was hired by the Cleveland police department. It is unclear whether the department had seen the Independence memo at the time of Loehmann’s hiring. “I have not received any instruction about it, and I have not received the file” from Independence, said Sgt Ali Pillow, a Cleveland police spokesman. He said the Cleveland department had not commented on whether it had seen the memo from Independence before Loehmann was hired. So the Cleveland Police Department either didn’t know that a man they hired to carry a loaded gun had been deemed unfit for policing, or they didn’t bother to check. I’m not sure which is worse.      U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that the Cleveland police department systematically engages in excessive use of force against civilians, and that a court-appointed monitor will now oversee implementation of reforms. (Reuters)   The roster of bad cops who manage to stay on the job after a litany of abuses would almost be comical if it weren’t for the fact that their behavior hurts and sometimes kills people. Most of the laws governing the procedures for firing bad cops are local, but it doesn’t seem like too much to ask for the federal government to start a national database of cops who have been fired or who resigned while under investigation. An easily searchable database would at least make it more difficult for a police agency to claim ignorance about a new cops’ prior history — and make them more liable if that cop abuses his authority again.   Even seemingly innocuous laws are enforced with violence Sen. Rand Paul took some heat this week for pointing out that Eric Garner was essentially executed for selling untaxed cigarettes. I’m not sure why this is a controversial thing to say (especially since Paul also explicitly said the video itself was “horrifying”). Every law, no matter how seemingly innocuous, is enforced with the threat of violence: If you fail to follow it, the state is saying it reserves the right to use violence to force you to comply and/or force you to submit to a penalty for violating the law. Every law passed also creates more opportunities for interaction with police officers, the people entrusted to use the violence necessary to enforce the laws. How a proposed law will be enforced, and potentially abused, ought to be considered in addition to the content of the law itself. For example, primary seat belt laws give cops another way to racially profile black motorists. It’s another excuse for a pretext stop. Earlier this year, I put up a post about the harrowing video showing South Carolina state trooper Sean Groubert firing a barrage of bullets at motorist Lavar Jones as Jones reached for his driver’s license. Groubert had pulled Jones over because Jones wasn’t wearing his seat belt. It isn’t the first time a seat belt stop has escalated to violence. In September, an Indiana family filed a lawsuit stemming from a seat belt stop that resulted in police smashing a car window and tasering one of the occupants. A Georgia family has filed a lawsuit after a traffic stop last January that ended with a teen being pulled from the car and handcuffed at gunpoint. He was cited only for not waring a seat belt. A seat belt stop in Florida last year led to an officer inadvertently running over and killing 38-year-old Marlon Brown. Now, I doubt that New York city council anticipated that failure to comply with this particular law would result in a man’s death, any more than legislators in Indiana, Georgia, South Carolina, or Florida anticipated that seat belt enforcement could end in tasings, shootings, or arrests. But you enforce the laws with the police institutions you have, not the police institutions you want. Low-level offenses are a tool police sometimes use to do sweeps for outstanding warrants, or as part of a “broken windows” strategy of law enforcement. These are tactics overwhelmingly deployed on low-income and minority communities. Moreover, the grand jury in New York determined that Officer Pantaleo acted in accordance with city and state law in the way he apprehended Eric Garner. The same policymakers that passed the tax are also responsible for the laws that govern the way in which that tax is enforced. They could change either policy tomorrow if they wanted. For example, they could require police to make attempts at deescalation before applying force. Or they could tell cops to put a low priority on arresting people who sell loose cigarettes. If they end up changing neither, then yes, they’ll be saying that death is an acceptable outcome for someone who sells loose, untaxed cigarettes. That’s why Garner was apprehended. If Pantaleo didn’t violate law or policy, and there’s nothing wrong with the law or policy, I don’t know how you get around that conclusion. It may be that the lives saved by seat belt laws and cigarette taxes are well worth the added police-citizen interactions needed to enforce them, and any incidents that might occur during those interactions. But I don’t see the harm in pointing out that these laws will result in more such interactions, or in pointing out which communities are likely to be on the receiving end of most of them. "
The Washington Post,L,"Jenna Bush Hager, hanky-panky, and the White House roof - The Washington Post"," By Helena Andrews December 4 at 1:45 PM  Follow @helena_andrews    Hands down the only thing weirder than Jenna Bush Hager admitting to “a little hanky-panky” on the White House roof, is the fact that anyone without the very first AARP card would say the words “hanky-panky.” As a guest on Wednesday night’s episode of Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live!”, the former first daughter was asked by a caller if she’d ever “fooled around” at her dad’s workplace, a.k.a the White House. The 33-year-old wife and mom, who was once known as the naughty twin (since everyone’s using old-timey language today), answered thusly, “Listen, a lady never talks.” Awesome. Moving on. No need to think about a 19-year-old Jenna Bush using the Lincoln Bedroom for unofficial activities. But then again this is Bravo. So, of course, there’s more. “You know maybe there was a little hanky-panky,” continued Bush Hager, who made sure to mention that she’s been with her “dream boat” husband, Henry Hager, since her dad got to Washington. “There was like maybe a kiss on the roof.” So, mystery solved?

The Washington Post,L,Police union: ‘We don’t believe it’s an issue of race. We believe it’s an issue of poverty’ - The Washington Post," By Lydia DePillis December 4 at 4:36 PM  Follow @lydiadepillis   Protests have broken out across the country after the decisions of two grand juries not to indict police officers in separate incidents that resulted in the deaths of two unarmed black men, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Demonstrators are asking whether police too often escape accountability  for the excessive use of force — and whether police unions, in defending their members, are part of the problem. The Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf and economist Adam Ozimek went so far as to argue that police shouldn’t have collective bargaining rights at all, since trust in the police is so damaged when officers who use excessive force walk free. “Being a police officer should be the kind of job where if you mess up a little bit, you get fired,” Ozimek writes. For a response, we checked in with Fraternal Order of Police National President Chuck Canterbury, who laid out the union’s perspective on police prosecutions and whether the force has a race problem. Here are some of his responses, lightly edited for clarity and length.    Are the police too well-protected? (Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News)  The national FOP has our own legal defense plan, but that’s predominantly used by smaller lodges, because they can’t afford a program. But most of our bigger police department unions have either funded through their dues plan, or they have a separate plan, for legal defense. For instance in my state, a member has to elect a legal plan and pay for it himself or herself. It’s in excess of their dues, and it’s a formal insurance policy. It covers administrative issues, disciplinary issues, as well as civil cases — where they’re sued and their employer is not required to represent them, then our plan kicks in. We haven’t seen a sharp increase in need. It’s been pretty steady for years and years and years. Our legal plan is not designed to get people off; it’s designed to allow them to have due process. A union’s job is to provide them an attorney for due process purposes. Every citizen we arrest has the right to have an attorney, so it gives our guys the right to have an attorney in the event that they’re accused of something. I don’t think complaints have increased in law enforcement. I think over the last 20 years complaints against police officers have gone down substantially [Editor's note: The latest federal data on complaints comes from 2002, and hasn't been updated since]. You have two high-profile cases right now in the media, but police in this country make millions of contacts a year in this country. Obviously there are going to be situations that occur where officers are accused of wrongdoing, but I think overall a tremendous professionalism has developed. … The thing about a grand jury process is they hear more evidence that people hear at a trial. So grand jury proceedings, contrary to popular belief, are a stalwart in our judicial system and very successful. There are police officers in jail right now all over the country who have been convicted of excessive force. Each complaint has to be judged on its own merits. The Justice Department alone — they’ve prosecuted over 300 police officers nationwide for excessive force complaints, using the civil rights clauses [Editor's note: The Department of Justice confirms that since 2009, 394 police and corrections officers have been charged in ""color of law"" cases]. A lot of police officers are discharged every year, and there’s not a national database of information, but sustained complaints result in an officer being terminated.      The president of the union that represents New York City police officers praised Wednesday's grand jury decision in Staten Island not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the choking death of Eric Garner last summer. (AP)   On race and policing: I think we’ve probably had the conversation long before the country’s had it. The FOP’s been on record over the last 15 years denouncing racial profiling. It’s not a legitimate police practice; it’s not taught in any police academy in the country. That doesn’t mean there aren’t officers who have racial bias. But any cop who demonstrates any form of racial bias should be put off the job, and we support that. The one topic that’s not being discussed and is never discussed is [that] we don’t believe it’s an issue of race. We believe it’s an issue of poverty. Communities that have distrust of law enforcement — it’s because law enforcement is the only part of government they ever see. They’re poor; infant mortality rates are higher; single-family homes are higher; unemployment is higher; people don’t live as long as the average American. And that is the issue in every community in America that we police. Race is an issue that should have open discussion, but the bottom line is, when you have depressed communities, it leads to higher crime, which leads to more police, which leads to the only part of government they ever see. Law enforcement’s even used in child cases. In most states, social workers can’t take a child away: Police are required to do that. Even when it’s not a criminal matter, police are usually the people who have to enforce it. The distrust in communities is not nearly seen as much in older Americans, because they want their neighborhoods protected, they want somebody patrolling. But I do think there’s a criminal element that distrusts law enforcement, and rightfully so, they should, because it’s our guys’ jobs to try to catch them. And in economically depressed areas, there’s lot of crime, and there’s a lot of call for law enforcement. And politicians and police management, going all the way back to the first broken windows community-oriented policing scenario, police have saturated high crime areas attempting to reduce crime rates. Look at the city of Washington, they reduced their poor communities by displacing them into Prince George’s County, and they reduced their crime rate significantly. Consequently, the Prince George’s murder rate went up. And the only thing that moved were poor people. I relate it to: You’ve got a young male that’s unemployed, can’t find a job, has no transportation to a job, sits in his neighborhood, and he watches the kid on the corner making $5,000 a week selling dope, being able to supply his family, and feeling hopeless. And I don’t think law enforcement’s the answer to those situations. There’s thousands and thousands of stories every year of police officers going out on their own and doing things for people in those poor neighborhoods. So I don’t agree that there’s a systemic racial bias in law enforcement. There’s hardly a police officer on the street now that was alive in the civil rights movement. It’s 20-somethings and 30-somethings out there doing police work, and they weren’t raised in segregated communities, so I think the racial bias in the ’60s that was obviously there in law enforcement is long gone. On the Cleveland shooting of a 12-year-old with an Airsoft gun: Obviously it’s not a real weapon, but our officers can’t tell that. Those Airsoft pistols look just as real as anything else if you take the orange off the tip. And there’s no real way to tell until you have a chance to examine it. Obviously officers have a chance to protect themselves if they’re approached by that type of weapon, and it’s a shame for the officers that have to be involved with that, they live with whatever action they take for the rest of their lives. But when the weapon looks real, they’re trained to react, and rightfully so. There’s nothing in American jurisprudence that says police officers are supposed to get assaulted or killed. On Eric Garner: The lessons from this week should be, even if you’re confronted by a law enforcement officer and you believe the officer’s wrong, resisting arrest is not the right answer. The right answer is to comply and use the system to file a complaint later. But resisting arrest can only lead to the officer using force to subdue you. You don’t use equal force — you use more force, because equal force doesn’t get you anywhere. If there’s an issue, there’s a lot of things in place to address that after the fact. But the most important thing is, resisting arrest seems to be the case when people get hurt. I can’t speak to [Garner’s] state of mind, and I don’t think anybody else can, either. He had over 30 previous arrests, so I think he knew what he was doing. Even in that case, if he’d complied and was put in handcuffs, he would’ve been out of custody in a matter of hours. If he’d complied, we wouldn’t even be talking about it. Nobody would’ve cared that he was arrested for selling illegally untaxed cigarettes. Which is a huge problem, by the way. There’s a huge criminal element. A few years ago, in Charlotte, North Carolina, they busted a ring that was sending money to al Qaeda, and they were doing it through illegal cigarette sales. So there is a nexus. Street-level selling loosies probably doesn’t lead to that, but it still was a crime that he was going to be arrested for. And he knew that. He’d been arrested before. "
The Washington Post,L,French horns? Snowshoes? TVs? Pentagon details what it gives to U.S. police - The Washington Post," By Dan Lamothe and Steven Rich December 4 at 1:40 PM  Follow @danlamothe Follow @dataeditor      A member of the St. Louis County Police Department points his weapon in the direction of a group of protesters in Ferguson, Mo. in August. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)  The Pentagon program that sends excess military equipment to police across the country has been under scrutiny since August, when civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., came to a head and the tactics of police there came under fire by civil rights advocates. But the controversy appears to have prompted change: after years of declining to do so, the Defense Department has released a detailed breakdown of what it has supplied to police departments. The results range from the mundane (battery chargers), to the powerful (armored mine-resistant vehicles), to the surprising (trumpets?). It also includes everything from helicopters to robots designed to help bomb squads. The Pentagon’s Excess Property Program, sometimes known as the 1033 Program, has supplied police departments across the country with more than $4.3 billion in gear since 1997, including $449 million in 2013, Pentagon officials said. The data was quietly posted on a Freedom of Information Act reading room for the Pentagon’s Defense Logistics Agency on Nov. 21, as the Marshall Project noted today. It’s a significant change in policy: The Defense Department has repeatedly rejected FOIA requests for a full accounting of the 1033 program’s recipients. The spreadsheets, captured here for Checkpoint, highlight the sheer volume of equipment the Pentagon is giving away — and that many of the departments receiving it are not big-city departments, but small police forces. There are hundreds of organizations that have received armored mine-resistant vehicles, for example. Designed to protect combat troops from gunfire, rockets and roadside bombs, they have been sent to police departments who are ostensibly concerned about terrorism. Recipients include:  The Val Verde Sheriff Office in Del Rio, Texas, which protects a rural county of about 50,000 people near the Mexico border. The Washington Police Department in Iowa, which has 10 sworn officers in a town of about 7,000. The Rehoboth Police Department in Massachusetts, which serves a town of about 10,000 along the Rhode Island border. The Saddleback College Police in California, which work at a community college.  Perhaps predictably, among the most common items issued were rifles, both in 5.56mm and 7.62mm caliber. They were supplied to departments large and small in a variety of quantities. Police in Long Beach, Calif., for example, have received 200 5.56mm rifles. On the unexpected side: the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department in southern California received 500 pairs of snowshoes, the Clayton Township Police Department in Michigan and the North Kingsville Police Department in Ohio each received a French horn, and more than 372 televisions were supplied to police across the country, designated “for personal/home use.” In Cherokee County, Ala., the sheriff’s department also received 15,000 metal fence posts. Total value: more than $127,000.

If comedy is tragedy plus time, I need more (expletive) time."" That was Jon Stewart's response to a Staten Island grand jury decision not to indict the NYPD officer who placed Eric Garner in an apparent chokehold in the summer. The unarmed black man later died. Stewart added at the opening of Wednesday's ""Daily Show"": ""...but I would really settle for less (expletive) tragedy, to be honest with you."" ""The Daily Show"" host played it serious during the opening segment, comparing the Garner case to last week's Ferguson grand jury decision, which also resulted in no indictment for a white cop who killed an unarmed black man. ""None of the ambiguities that existed in the Ferguson case exist in the Staten Island case,"" Stewart said, ""and yet the outcome is exactly the same.""    The Daily Show Get More: Daily Show Full Episodes,Indecision Political Humor,The Daily Show on Facebook   The July confrontation between Garner and Officer Daniel Pantaleo was videotaped; the widely-circulated footage of Pantaleo holding Garner's neck in an apparent chokehold as the man repeatedly says, ""I can't breathe,"" prompted outrage in New York and beyond. Garner died just weeks before officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. The Ferguson case, however, was not filmed. Prosecutors there presented conflicting witness accounts of the confrontation to the grand jury. But Stewart said that in contrast to the Ferguson case, the Staten Island case appeared to be clear. ""Here, there is is none of that [ambiguity]. The coroner called it homicide, the guy's not acting threatening, and we know that because we are (expletive) watching it. Someone taped it."" ""To look at the bright side, we're about to save ourselves a (expletive) of money on cop-camera vests,"" Stewart added of one of the Obama administration's proposed solutions to incidents like those in Ferguson and Staten Island. ""I assume that the solution that they're proposing, if implemented, would look something like the Eric Garner case.""  ""We are definitely not living in a post-racial society."" Stewart added, ""and I can imagine there are a lot of people out there wondering how much of a society we're living in at all.""

The Washington Post,L,The big winner of the holiday season so far: mobile shopping - The Washington Post," By Sarah Halzack December 4 at 10:59 AM  Follow @sarahhalzack      There's a mobile app for eBay's smartphone consumers. (Photo by Paul Sakuma Photography/eBay via AP Images)  For years now, we've heard a steady drumbeat of forecasts suggesting that mobile devices are going to play an increasingly crucial role in every step of a shopping expedition, from browsing and couponing to purchasing. And in the five-day shopping bonanza that stretched from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, there was ample evidence that this long-anticipated tipping point has arrived.  For the first time ever, smartphones and tablets accounted for the majority of all online traffic on Thanksgiving Day, according to data analysis by IBM. On Black Friday, one in four online purchases were made on a mobile device. ""This year was probably the first holiday season that we really saw mobile really take off,” said Brian Yarbrough, senior retail analyst at financial services firm Edward Jones. Wal-Mart says that about 70 percent of its Web traffic between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday came from mobile devices, while JCPenney said more than half of its traffic came from smartphones and tablets. Best Buy's Web site was briefly taken down Friday morning while the company struggled to deal with an unexpected surge in mobile Web traffic. As users take to mobile platforms in greater numbers, retailers are learning that small-screen shoppers are different: They buy fewer things and have less patience for a checkout process that is anything less than incredibly efficient. Also, while shoppers did plenty of browsing this holiday season on their cellphones, tablets and PCs still reigned for actually making purchases. Smartphones accounted for 34.7 percent of traffic on Black Friday, but just 11.8 percent of sales.  Tablets accounted for 14.6 percent of traffic and 16 percent of sales. ""There's some kind of a disparity between traffic and conversion on smartphones,"" said Calvin Silva, senior retail industry analyst for Nasdaq Advisory Services. BaubleBar discovered that how mobile customers reach the e-commerce jewelry company's site can make a difference. Tablet shoppers were more likely to reach the company's site through a search engine this holiday season, while smartphone users were more likely to come from Facebook or other social media. The company had to adjust, said Daniella Yacobovsky, a BaubleBar co-founder. For tablets and laptops, which have larger screens, Yacobovsky said, ""we feel comfortable sending them to pages that have a little bit more of a design element to them."" Elissa Margolis, senior vice president of Disney Store North America, said that a large share of Disney Store's mobile shoppers were simply browsing. ""Our merchandise is exclusive, so they’re not using it [for] comparisons across other retailers,"" Margolis said. ""But they may be using it to see if an item is available, read reviews."" Margolis said that about 90 percent of Disney Store's mobile traffic has typically come from Web browsers, not the store's app. But Margolis said the company is now doubling down on trying to draw more users to its app, which she acknowledges will be challenging. ""There needs to be a reason why you would put an app on your phone versus just using your browser,"" Margolis said. JCPenney revamped its iPhone app and mobile Web site in time for the holidays.  The company said it believes the more seamless experience helped it turn more mobile browsers into buyers, reaching a conversion rate ""in the 30 percent range"" during parts of the holiday weekend. Retailers and analysts say they expect that the growth of mobile sales and traffic to be a bright spot throughout the holiday season. In particular, they predict these gadgets will be crucial weapons for the omnichannel shopper -- that is, the one who bounces around between in-store, desktop and mobile shopping. ""The consumer expects to be able to go in and out of a physical and digital world in a completely seamless way,"" said Doug Hope, a retail marketing expert with GlobalShop. ""This is the very beginning of a very significant shift in focus."" "
The Washington Post,L,Rams Coach Jeff Fisher says RGIII is too talented to be done in the NFL - The Washington Post," By Dan Steinberg December 4 at 9:25 AM  Follow @dcsportsbog      (Photo by John McDonnell/The Washington Post)  Back in the winter of 2012 — when the Redskins were rolling and their 2013 first-round pick was rapidly moving down the draft order — many Washington boosters were convinced the Rams had been fleeced in that famous 2012 pre-draft trade. After Robert Griffin III struggled in 2013 and the Rams continued to acquire additional starters from their haul of picks, more and more people began seeing the trade as a push, or worse. And now that Griffin has been benched twice in three years, and the young Rams seem at least marginally ahead of the Redskins, the conventional wisdom would indicate that St. Louis won the trade, possibly in a rout. Rams Coach Jeff Fisher has talked about the trade several times this week in advance of Sunday’s game — “it was easy for us to do,” he told Washington reporters. But Fisher refused to take the next step, celebrating how much better the trade looks with Griffin on the bench. “And RGIII’s not even playing right now…” a reporter in St. Louis said this week, as Fisher discussed the trade. “No, he’s not,” Fisher answered. “But that’s really not our issue. And in his defense, his rookie year, he took them to the playoffs. And any quarterback that’s going to go through significant injuries like he did, and two offensive philosophy changes and scheme changes, I think that’s hard. I don’t believe you’ve seen the last of him. I don’t believe that. I think he’s too talented. That’s their deal, [but] that’s my opinion on him. I think he’s got a chance to be a really good quarterback.” Another reporter then asked whether Griffin could still turn his career around. “He’s just scratching the surface from a career standpoint, yeah,” Fisher said. “Again, injuries and scheme changes are hard to overcome — for anybody, for that matter. Fisher also acknowledged that if Sam Bradford hadn’t been on his roster in 2012, the Rams probably would have done “something different” with their pick, the implication being that Griffin could have been in play. In fact, Fisher mentioned mentioned Griffin’s multiple offensive schemes at least two other times this week. “I don’t think they know exactly where they’re going with RG,” he said on his radio show on ESPN 101. “Maybe he needs some more experience to learn this offense. It’s his second offense in three years.” And he said much the same to Washington reporters. “We played Robert early his first year, and he made a lot of plays, and to get that team into the playoffs as a rookie is pretty impressive,” Fisher said. “Unfortunately for him, he’s dealing with an offensive scheme change and he’s had injury. Those two things, [from] a quarterback standpoint, are just hard to overcome. I think he’s an outstanding talent and very hard to defend.”"
The Washington Post,L,"The long, halting, unfinished fight to end racial profiling in America - The Washington Post"," By Emily Badger December 4 at 8:08 AM  Follow @emilymbadger      President Obama now has the chance to fulfill a promise originally made by George W. Bush: ending racial profiling in America. (AP)  In his very first address to Congress — in the speech where new presidents first detail their priorities for the nation — George W. Bush devoted a few moments to an unlikely topic: racial profiling. ""Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our nation's justice,"" he said, ""when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups instead of individuals."" The issue had, in fact, played into the 2000 election. The national news was full of stories of doctors and lawyers and NFL players stopped for ""driving while black,"" in seemingly every state from California to Massachusetts. Both candidates that year were asked in a presidential debate if they would support a federal law banning racial profiling, and they said they would. Before Congress, Bush was unequivocal. ""Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the attorney general, to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling,"" he announced. ""It's wrong, and we will end it in America."" More than a decade later, with a rare moment of bipartisan momentum long past, Bush's promise remains unfulfilled. Communities across the country still chafe at the profiling they perceive in state immigration laws that allow police to disproportionately challenge the status of Hispanics, in surveillance of local Muslim communities, and in statistics showing that blacks are still interrogated by police on the street at a far higher rate than other groups. Black drivers, nationwide, are twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop. The consequences of this racial profiling are as evident as ever: in the frayed relationships between police and minorities, in the deep distrust among minorities of the justice system, and in the racial tension in Ferguson, Mo.    A New York Civil Liberties Union analysis of stop-and-frisk data from the NYPD in 2011.  The year Bush declared that profiling was wrong, a bill was introduced in Congress, the End Racial Profiling Act, that attempted to make good on his promise. It required federal agencies to stop the practice, and local agencies that wanted federal money to do the same. By the fall of 2001, though — after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 — the will to tackle the issue waned. People who opposed profiling black drivers on New Jersey highways found they felt differently about profiling Muslim passengers at airports. When he came to office, Barack Obama inherited much of the same problems that Bush described. And his attorney general, Eric Holder, vowed early in the new administration to pick up where Ashcroft left off, putting the weight of the federal government more firmly behind a policy to eradicate racial profiling. Holder's promise, though, has lingered for the last four years, the review of federal policy dragging on, the new guidance still unreleased as the final days of Holder's tenure wind down. Civil-rights groups have grown anxious waiting for it, as several incidents —  from the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., to the shooting of Michael Brown, to the death of Eric Garner — have fanned racial tensions across the country. On Monday, speaking in Atlanta about the tension that erupted in Ferguson, Holder hinted that he would finally announce such changes in the coming days, unveiling ""rigorous new standards"" on the use of race by law enforcement — ""to help end racial profiling,"" he said, ""once and for all."" The new policy would be one of the last major accomplishments of Holder's tenure, a central pillar of his civil-rights legacy.      Speaking in the church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, Attorney General Eric Holder discussed the investigation into the Ferguson shooting, as well as a plan to reform law enforcement practices. (AP)   Gaping loopholes Civil-rights advocates did not get the federal law they sought under the Bush administration. (The End Racial Profiling Act has been introduced, to no effect, in every Congress since). They did, however, eventually get an important document from the Department of Justice -- an 11-page ""guidance regarding the use of race by federal law enforcement agencies."" In that 2003 decree by Ashcroft, the federal government for the first time defined racial profiling, and in stark terms: 'Racial profiling' at its core concerns the invidious use of race or ethnicity as a criterion in conducting stops, searches and other law enforcement investigative procedures. It is premised on the erroneous assumption that any particular individual of one race or ethnicity is more likely to engage in misconduct than any particular individual of another race or ethnicity. Racial profiling in law enforcement is not merely wrong, but also ineffective. Its use by law enforcement, the document said, also ""has a terrible cost"" to individuals and the nation's values. ""I think people were surprised that something like this could come out of John Ashcroft and the Bush Administration — pleasantly surprised,"" says Laura Murphy, director of the Washington Legislative Office of the American Civil Liberties Union. But the guidance, which prohibited racial profiling by federal law enforcement agencies, also contained some gaping loopholes, making it a valuable statement of principles but a hollow tool for enforcing them. First, the principles: The DOJ acknowledged that racial profiling is actually ineffective. This is especially noteworthy, since even today prominent officials have continued to dispute the idea, even if they don't use the word ""profiling."" Up until the end of his tenure last year, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the city's aggressive stop-and-frisk program for disproportionately targeting the groups that he said commit disproportionate amounts of crime. Neither opponents of racial profiling nor the 2003 federal guidance deny the right of law enforcement officers to use race in responding to specific descriptions of criminals. Officers don't have to ignore the race of a suspect if he's described as ""black, 5'10"", wearing a gray sweater."" Racial profiling, rather, refers more broadly to the kind of calculation Bloomberg was describing: That if officers stop more blacks, they will increase their chances of finding criminals, because criminals are more likely to be black.    A 2004 Gallup poll illustrates that American views on racial profiling depend on the context where it occurs.  That ""profiling hypothesis,"" as law professor David A. Harris puts it, has repeatedly been proven wrong. Harris' analyses have found that racial profiling actually makes police less accurate, not more so, in catching criminal activity. That's because it wastes resources on false positives among people police would never otherwise stop (black lawyers on their way to work), and because the focus on race diverts attention from the clues that actually do hint at criminal activity. ""If you want to know if somebody is involved in, say, transporting drugs on a highway, if you want to know whether somebody might be up to no good in an airport, you should watch with unrelenting intensity what they are doing, not what they look like — because that’s the only good predictor,"" says Harris, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.  Harris often hears people justify profiling Arabs at airports as ""better safe than sorry."" But, in fact, by making law enforcement less accurate, Harris argues that profiling potentially makes communities less safe. And this effect is further compounded by the mistrust that arises in heavily profiled communities, where residents are wary of reporting crime or of cooperating with law enforcement. Ashcroft's 2003 guidance, however, also included important loopholes. The document applied only to federal law enforcement agencies, not local ones. And it carved out exceptions for the two broad cases where profiling is most relevant to federal work: in national security and border integrity. DOJ's piercing language on the costs of racial profiling did not apply, in other words, to terrorism investigations, airport screenings or border patrol. They left open the ability for federal agencies like the FBI to map Muslim Americans living in Michigan, for example, to track potential terrorist threats. They granted wide latitude to Customs and Border Protection, which operates well inside the U.S. border. ""The exceptions were written so broadly that they basically swallowed the rule,"" says Farhana Khera, the executive director of the legal advocacy organization Muslim Advocates. Familiar numbers Shortly after protests began this summer in Ferguson, decrying unequal treatment of blacks by local police, numbers came out that seemed to support the protesters' point. Racial profiling data compiled by the Missouri attorney general found that black drivers were the target of 86 percent of traffic stops in the city last year, and 93 percent of traffic stops that ended in an arrest. By contrast, blacks make up 63 percent of the local population over 16.  Those numbers are not so different from data the ACLU compiled in the 1990s for a series of lawsuits that helped turn racial profiling into a national story and a subject of presidential debate. In one suit against the Illinois State Police, the ACLU found that Hispanics, who made up less than 1 percent of the driving-age population in several counties outside of St. Louis, made up nearly a third of stops there for speeding less than five miles over the speed limit. Similar disparities occur today far from St. Louis: In New York City, young black men in 2011 were involved in a quarter of stop-and-frisk cases, while making up less than 2 percent of the city's population. In Boston, police data show that blacks, who make up about a quarter of the city's population, were involved in 63 percent of encounters with police from 2007-2010. This critique doesn't necessarily imply that law enforcement should interact with each demographic group in exact proportion to its share of the population. But such extreme disparities reveal that police are stopping many minorities who've committed no crime, and leaving young black men in particular at risk when police stops escalate into deadly encounters. The numbers on continuing racial disparities in police profiling reflect the environment — and the anger — Holder inherited when he announced, in 2010, that the DOJ would review and update Ashcroft's original guidance. In the years since then, civil-rights advocates have lobbied intensely. They have pushed Holder to eliminate the national and border security loopholes. They have pushed him to add religious protections, too, to cover Muslims and Sikhs who've felt particularly targeted, often because of their appearance, since Sept. 11. They also want Holder to extend his reach to local law enforcement agencies, by insisting on the same anti-racial profiling standards for departments that receive federal resources (like free hand-me-down military equipment, community-policing grants, or those body-camera funds Obama also announced this week). In many contexts, after all, Washington has used federal resources as leverage to influence local policy. As attorney general, Holder otherwise has no control over policies set by local police departments. Advocates have been repeating these requests for several years now, in new reports and open letters and public pleas. Now, as Holder prepares to finally announce the new standards, they are anxious about what he will say. ""They can repeat back to us everything that we’ve asked for, but they have not shared a draft, they have not said 'we can do this, but we can’t do that,'"" says Murphy of the ACLU. ""They have been more tight-lipped about this policy than George Bush’s Administration was when the guidance came out in 2003."" That reality suggests, ironically, that it may have been easier for John Ashcroft to denounce racial profiling in 2003 — to declare that the American ""goal of 'liberty and justice for all' recedes with every act of such discrimination"" — than for the nation's first black attorney general, and first black president, to say so today. ""Every time this administration tries to have a conversation about addressing racial problems in this society, they’ve gotten slammed,"" Murphy says. ""Everything from the beer summit to Holder’s speech on ‘we're cowards’ on issues of race — they just have been treated like no other administration. And I think it’s totally unfair, and it’s had the effect of chilling certain actions on their part."""
The Washington Post,L,Does this postal chairman’s lobbying history pose a conflict of interest? - The Washington Post," By Josh Hicks December 4 at 6:00 AM  Follow @reporter_hicks      The Postal Service could potentially make billions of dollars annually by offering small loans, but private lenders aren’t fond of the idea. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  The U.S. Postal Service is in a position to earn billions of dollars a year by entering the payday-loan business, but former banking lobbyist Mickey Barnett could block its path. Barnett now chairs the USPS Board of Governors. He previously represented the interests of payday lenders, the very folks who stand to lose out if the Postal Service grabs a share of the small-loan market. By venturing into the loan business, the Postal Service could experience an influx of new revenue after eight straight years of multibillion-dollar losses. Would Barnett support such a move, or would he oppose it because of his old ties to the banking industry? Either way, the Leadership Conference on Human and Civil Rights sees a potential conflict of interest. The group issued a letter to all members of the Senate this week urging the lawmakers not to confirm Barnett for another term until he thoroughly explains his positions on payday lending. “As a past lobbyist for the payday-lending industry, Mr. Barnett has demonstrated a willingness to ignore the public interest in favor of the pecuniary interests of his clients,” the letter said. “He must give assurances that he would not use his position to promote the practices of the industry he previously represented.” The Leadership Conference also suggested that the Postal Service would be a more trustworthy source of payday loans, which are cash advances that have to be repaid by the next payday. The loans are controversial because of their high interest rates and the fact that they often trap low-income individuals in a cycle of debt. A report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this years said more than 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within two weeks. A report this year from the USPS inspector general said the Postal Service could offer interest rates of 28 percent on payday loans, which would be far lower than the triple-digit rates that traditional lenders charge. Payday lenders tend to set up shop in African-American and Hispanic communities, which is another reason the Leadership Conference has taken such an interest in Barnett’s stance toward the practice. The group sees an opportunity for the Postal Service, which Americans largely trust, to provide cash advances in those communities at lower rates. Barnett joined the postal board in 2006. The previous year, he opposed efforts by the New Mexico legislature to impose stricter regulations on payday lenders, such as limiting delinquency fees and requiring lenders to forgive loans once a customer has paid twice the amount that was borrowed. Working as an attorney, Barnett argued in one case that borrowers must settle disputes with lenders through arbitration rather than through the courts, and that no such restrictions should apply to lenders. The New Mexico Supreme Court unanimously rejected that position as “substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.” The Postal Service has long provided financial services, including money orders and international money transfers. It also offered savings accounts until 1967. Researchers have estimated that the agency could bring in nearly $9 billion annually by capturing 10 percent of the market from Americans on the fringes of the banking system, according to the inspector general’s report. But industry groups such as the American Bankers Association have pushed back against further USPS forays into the financial-services, arguing that the agency could have unfair advantages — theoretically through fewer regulations and the perception of being government-endorsed. Any major policy changes for the Postal Service require congressional approval, so the agency’s board of governors could not act alone on the payday-loan matter. But Barnett would still play a deciding role if the Senate confirms him for another term. The USPS has not provided a statement from Barnett or a reaction to the Leadership Conference’s concerns, despite several requests from the Federal Eye on Wednesday."
The Washington Post,L,Even climate change experts and activists are in denial about climate change - The Washington Post,"  By Aanka Batta and Steffen Böhm December 4 at 11:55 AM Follow SteffenBoehm   About the authors  Aanka Batta is a lecturer in marketing at University of Essex.Steffen Böhm is a professor in management and sustainability and the director of the Essex Sustainability Institute at University of Essex.       Fires burn in the Amazon basin in Brazil. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)  Another month, another important U.N. climate change conference. The latest is in Lima, the capital of Peru. Thousands of experts from the world of politics, business, academia and civil society – and Leonardo DiCaprio – have flown around the world to urge us all to curb our carbon emissions. Recent meetings have failed to make significant progress. Yet, this year there are high hopes that the U.S.-China climate deal and the New York U.N. Climate Summit will allow Lima to provide a stepping stone for a binding emissions agreement at next year’s meeting in Paris. However, even if a deal can be reached – despite the urgent need for it – there is no guarantee that global greenhouse gas emissions will actually be reduced significantly and that dangerous climate change can be averted. Psychoanalytic theory provides disturbing insight into why this may be so – and it is all to do with the split psychological makeup of those who work at the forefront of climate science, policy and activism. Climate denial can be unconscious For at least a century, psychoanalysis has taught us that we might be consciously thinking and saying one thing, but unconsciously doing another. In this context, that means people are very aware of the threats posed by climate change, even if they aren’t doing too much about it. Not a week goes by without the media showing catastrophic images of environmental damage and social suffering seemingly caused by a changing climate. Research suggests that such threats lead us to adopt various unconscious coping and defense mechanisms. Many people try to keep the catastrophe at bay or deny it is happening. Vested interests such as the Koch brothers in the United States and other conservative forces have cleverly exploited this unconscious response by supporting a small group of scientists, politicians and think tanks to spread the message of climate skepticism and denial.  This stuff works. Climate denial is undoubtedly on the rise, particularly in those media-saturated markets of North America, Europe and Australia. The Kochs and others are clearly filling a psychological void. Research also has shown that “people want to protect themselves a little bit,” particularly in times of crisis and uncertainty. If climate change simply isn’t happening, there’s nothing to worry about. Another popular coping and defense mechanism is to pretend that we can address this global and urgent problem by tinkering at the edges of “business as usual.” For example, politicians and business leaders widely believe that we can achieve a decarbonization of the global economy while maintaining high economic growth. Social psychologist Matthew Adams says such a response is part of an unconscious coping mechanism that simply implies that we have pushed the problem onto a distant future. As the geographer Erik Swyngedouw shows, climate change politics could in fact be seen as a “post-political” phenomenon where apocalyptic images of environmental destruction and human suffering are used to justify swift action without allowing any real political and economic choices. For example, while on one day the U.K. government is acknowledging that climate change is having stark impacts on developing countries by pledging 720 million pounds (about $1.1 billion) to poor countries, another day of the political calendar is dominated by rhetoric that emphasizes economic growth and even the expansion of the oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom. Urgent action on climate change is thus to be implemented within a business-as-usual framework of high growth and high consumption, despite growing evidence that such growth doesn’t make us happier and that it is very likely to deliver increasing carbon emissions for years and decades to come. In psychosocial theory, these defense mechanisms also are referred to as “splitting.” Consciously we might be talking about the impending sustainability crisis, but unconsciously we find ways to maintain the status quo. This is also true for those climate experts who fly around the world, going from one global climate change summit to the next. The very carbon emissions associated with their work can be seen as part of a denial strategy. In fact, one could argue that those who are very close to the reality of climate change are particularly prone to a need to split their identity.

The Washington Post,L,Arab autocrats are not going back to the future - The Washington Post," By Steven Heydemann December 4 at 2:59 PM     Protesters display a large Jordanian flag as they demonstrate to demand political reforms, in Amman, Oct. 5, 2012.  (Muhammad Hamed/Reuters)  During the Arab uprisings of late 2010 and 2011, it seemed that the strategies Arab leaders had adopted to keep themselves in power had left them vulnerable to an uncontrollable surge of mass mobilization. Yet by late 2014, even as Arab regimes struggled to manage the aftershocks of mass protests and, in some cases, respond to sustained popular mobilization that has continued, it is clear that authoritarian regimes in the Arab world not only survived the uprisings but adapted their tactics and practices to address the specific challenges associated with the resurgence of mass politics and sustain their hold on power. The events of the past four years are not merely a back to the future moment in authoritarian governance in the Arab world. This reassertion of authoritarianism since 2012 did not come about simply because authoritarian elites in the Middle East held fast to established political routines. In responding to the resurgence of mass politics – processes of mobilization that were in large part caused by popular discontent with failures of authoritarian governance – authoritarian elites have been compelled to adapt. In some cases, regime adaptations drew on but modified established practices. In others, adaptations seem to signal more fundamental changes in elite perceptions about the nature of the threats they face and the changes that would be required to ensure regime survival. In these cases, regime elites seem to have made important, and in some cases potentially transformative, changes in their policies and tactics to control and contain newly mobilized societies. Regime survival should not be taken to minimize the magnitude of the threat that the Arab uprisings posed. Those mass protests confronted regimes with the most significant challenge they had ever faced. The threat of politics from below was all the more potent because it emerged in systems of rule that were explicitly designed to prevent oppositional forms of collective action and spontaneous political mobilization. That the regimes did nonetheless almost universally survive should underscore two important features of arguments about resilient authoritarianism that are often overlooked. First, theories about resilient authoritarianism, and the adaptive capacity of authoritarian regimes in the Arab world, have never taken the position that current systems of rule are permanent or invulnerable. The appropriate metaphor is of earthquake resistant, not earthquake proof, regimes. Second, these theories do not assume that adaptive processes are always limited and constrained by past practices: Path dependence matters, but at moments of crisis in particular, regime adaptations can and do move governance beyond the boundaries of current practices. I view the post-uprising period of the Arab Thermidor as representing one such period. What seem to be emerging as these adaptations take hold are two distinctive modes of authoritarian governance, both of which have troubling implications for the political future of the Middle East. In one set of cases, including Jordan and Morocco, Algeria, and much of the Arab Gulf, shifts in governance are best defined as the extension and deepening of strategies of authoritarian upgrading, reframed in response to the specific challenges posed by the resurgence of mass politics. In a second set of cases, however, including Syria and Egypt, changes in authoritarian governance appear to be more profound. The regimes that are emerging from the most threatening encounters with mass politics are making a sharp, perhaps decisive break with the populist, inclusionary strategies of contained mobilization through which they governed for many decades. What is emerging instead are narrowly-nationalist and exclusionary-repressive modes of authoritarian governance. In both modes, reconfigured authoritarian practices are consistent with the inability of Arab regimes either to sustain redistribution and guarantees of economic security as the basis of state-society relations and conceptions of citizenship, or to establish viable, market-oriented political economies capable of addressing massive, systemic employment crises and ameliorating chronic conditions of economic insecurity that are especially acute among youth. To understand why this most recent cycle of adaptations by authoritarian incumbents marks a decisive shift in governance, and to appreciate its potentially transformative effects, it is useful to assess the broader context in which regime elites are acting today and how it compares to the environment that shaped the systems of rule over which they presided until 2011. In the era in which most post-colonial Arab states were established, newly empowered elites who inherited weak and sharply contested political and economic institutions drew heavily on contemporary understandings about how best to organize a state, manage a national economy, and structure relations between states and societies. At the time, Arab leaders were encouraged by then nascent international financial institutions, such as the newly-established International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to build large, powerful public sectors as a way to compensate for the weakness of private sectors. They embraced import substitution industrialization, the dominant development strategy for developing economies in the post-WWII era, to promote industrialization and the commercialization of agriculture. To exploit but simultaneously manage and channel the high levels of mass mobilization that had emerged in the course of anti-colonial struggles, the first generation of populist-authoritarian leaders – Gamal Abdel Nasser, Adib Shishakli, Habib Bourguiba, Ahmed Ben Bella, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr – embraced pan-Arabism, formed mass-based ruling parties, and promoted state-corporatist frameworks of interest representation. They adopted redistributive social policies, consolidating patterns of state-society relations anchored in “authoritarian bargains” that guaranteed economic security in exchange for political quiescence. For almost 30 years, this formula produced extraordinary improvements in social conditions across the Arab world. By the mid-1980s, these populist-redistributive systems of rule had become increasingly difficult for regime elites to sustain. Economic crises and the fiscal burden of welfare, subsidy programs, and service provision forced authoritarian incumbents to adapt. Beginning in the 1980s, but with growing momentum in the 1990s, incumbents responded – as they had in the 1950s and 1960s – by appropriating, adapting and applying elements drawn from a global repertoire of models of governance and social policy. Mimicking versions of 1980s-era neo-liberal developmental strategies, in form if rarely in content, they introduced selective strategies of economic and political liberalization that gradually moved Middle East and North Africa political economies toward what the Syrian regime later labeled social market development frameworks. Precursors of the upgrading strategies of the late-1990s and 2000s, these frameworks combined liberalization of select economic sectors, typically determined on the basis of political, regime maintenance criteria, with weakened systems of redistribution. They were designed to generate the resources required to maintain patronage networks, provide opportunities for predatory rent seeking by increasingly narrow circles of regime insiders, and mitigate the broad social effects of reductions in public expenditure. During these years, the organizational “containers” that had earlier served to manage and channel mass politics decayed. Ruling parties and corporatized associational sectors retained some importance as pathways for patronage, positions and a declining share of economic privilege, but could no longer provide any meaningful sense of political or economic inclusion. In their place, regimes relied more heavily on the institutions of the mukhabarat, intelligence or secret police, to maintain internal security and repress autonomous forms of political mobilization and oppositional collective action. In effect, the authoritarian bargain of the post-independence era had become an authoritarian compromise, the costs of which were borne by the urban middle class, rural clientalist networks, public sector workers and residents of peripheral cities, the social groups that provided the backbone of the Arab uprisings. This potted macro-sociological history of Arab regime formation and reform underscores the importance of the contemporary regional and global context, and its effects on the strategic choices of incumbents, in assessing the dynamics of authoritarian reassertion during the so-called Arab Thermidor. Upgrading strategies that served as an effective response to the challenges regimes confronted in the 1990s and 2000s carried social costs that they could not contain indefinitely. Having confronted these costs during the peak of the Arab uprisings, the principal challenge faced by authoritarian incumbents today is how to manage the enduring, systemic threat of mass politics under conditions of poor capitalism. With ineffectual economic institutions and deep, systemic employment gaps that regimes are unable to close, how can they prevent persistent high levels of anti-regime mass political mobilization? To contend with mobilized publics and to preserve the selective benefits associated with social market strategies of economic governance, regime elites today have a very different set of models on which to draw. The statist, inclusionary and redistributive models of controlled mass mobilization that prevailed in the post-independence era – with all they implied about republicanism, egalitarian conceptions of citizenship, and a moral economy relationship between states and citizens – are simply no longer available as viable options for regime elites. Similarly, with implications that have yet to be fully explored for MENA political economies, the condition that economist Dani Rodrik has recently characterized as premature deindustrialization further constrains the developmental options available to authoritarian incumbents in the Arab world, and further reduces the strategies they can use to close the massive employment gaps they confront, generate highly-skilled industrial employment, and enjoy the large spill-over benefits for other sectors that accompany industrialization. To the extent that MENA political economies are defined by premature deindustrialization, the pathways out of poor capitalism will be very hard to find. The likely outcome is a massive semi-permanent class of underemployed and unemployed whom the state will view as a persistent threat to stability, necessitating repressive-exclusionary modes of governance. Even if MENA countries can escape the trap of premature deindustrialization the alternatives to authoritarianism face strong headwinds. Democratization has been discredited by its association with the presidency of Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, as well as the Libyan and Yemeni experiences. It has been further undermined by public disillusionment with Western liberalism, and by the declining leverage of Western democracies over regional actors who no longer depend on the West for foreign investment and foreign assistance. Nor can the transnational ideologies that legitimated (and tested) Arab regimes, including various versions of politicized Islam, serve that purpose any longer. In contrast, market-oriented models of authoritarian governance are seen as viable alternatives. Reflecting regional trends toward sectarian polarization, regime elites in Syria, Egypt, Bahrain and Libya have sought to reframe mechanisms for containing and channeling mass politics – much of which continues to revolve around demands for economic inclusion, voice, and distributive justice – around combinations of exclusionary, xenophobic, ethno-sectarian, and tribal conceptions of state-society relations and citizenship, policed by newly reinvigorated post-uprising internal security agencies. Thus, even while emergent models of authoritarian governance in the Arab world exhibit a wide range of continuities, they are moving beyond the authoritarian bargains and the authoritarian compromises of earlier eras, toward repressive-exclusionary systems of rule organized in response to the threat of mass politics under conditions of poor capitalism. These emergent models will generate stresses that will test their capacity and their resilience. In their current incarnation, however, the trajectories of authoritarian governance in the Arab world seem to offer little basis for optimism among those who have long hoped that prosperity and democracy would find a firm foothold in the Middle East.

The Washington Post,L,Ben Carson to Wolf Blitzer: I stand by my Nazi Germany-U.S. comments - The Washington Post," By Erik Wemple December 3  Follow @ErikWemple    Ben Carson, the famed neurosurgeon and conservative commentator, has enjoyed a welcoming platform at Fox News, where he formerly served as a contributor. In early November, for instance, Carson outlined a program for ending the cycle of dependency among the poor on an edition of “Hannity.” Host Sean Hannity responded, “A bold vision.” On Nov. 21, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, in discussing Carson’s presidential prospects, told Carson, “I will assure you that if [leftists] come after you in an unfair way, we will step up and help you out with that.” Possible-presidential-candidate Carson now needs to show off his bona fides to other cable-news audiences, which perhaps explains why he surfaced this afternoon on CNN with anchor Wolf Blitzer. A significant chunk of the discussion focused on comments wherein Carson has compared the contemporary United States to Nazi Germany. “To make the comparison of the United States and Nazi Germany — that just struck an awful tone,” said Blitzer in a non-question question. Carson responded: “Well, Nazi Germany experienced something horrible. The people in Nazi Germany largely did not believe in what Hitler was doing, but did they say anything? Of course not — they kept their mouths shut. And there’s some very important lessons to be learned there. The fact that our government is using instruments of government like the IRS to punish its opponents — this is not the kind of thing something that, as far as I’m concerned, is a Democrat or Republican issue. This is an American issue. This is something that threatens all of our liberty, all of our freedom.” Carson said a bit more about how Americans are afraid to express themselves, not that Blitzer was impressed with the logic: “But to make the comparison, Dr. Carson, to Nazi Germany, the slaughter of six million Jews by the Nazis, the devastation that erupted in Europe and around the world, to the United States of America,” said Blitzer. “I want you to reflect on what that potentially means.” Complying with Blitzer’s polite request, Carson explained: “Again, you are just focusing on the words ‘Nazi Germany’ and completely missing the point … and that’s the problem right now. That’s what PCism is all about. You may not say this word, regardless of what your point is. Because if you say that word, I go into a tizzy. We can do better than that. When I was a child, and when you were a child, they used to say, ‘Sticks and stones break my bones, words will never hurt me.’ What ever happened to that? We need to get to the point where we can look beyond the word and look for the meaning.” Please excuse Blitzer for thinking that the words “Nazi Germany” have patent meaning without looking “beyond the word.” The host asked Carson if he wished to amend his stance on the parallels between Nazi Germany and the United States. Carson declined the invitation. That’s hardly surprising, given that Carson has been terribly consistent on this point. "
The Washington Post,L,How I manage a demanding New York job while living in Crimea and caring for my cancer-stricken mother - The Washington Post," By Lika Nikanorova December 4 at 7:45 AM     Lika Nikanorova works for a New York start-up from her home in Crimea. (Anton Nikanorov)  Lika Nikanorov is a 24-year-old software developer living in Crimea. This summer, Lika landed a competitive New York tech job through a new company called PowerToFly. PowerToFly’s innovative business model seeks to infuse the tech industry with more women through remote work. This is Lika’s story in her own words, as told to Marie Elizabeth Oliver and Julia Kits: I live in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea. My husband and I moved here from Kiev after annexation to be closer to family and because the city’s infrastructure is more stable compared to some of the smaller towns nearby. Annexation was a total shock to me, and the situation is still very painful. Legally I’m now Russian, but in my heart I’m Ukrainian. Every day we fear new bank sanctions and electricity outages, while the cost of living continues to increase. The main Ukrainian bank froze accounts and shutdown international transactions during the transition, so I can’t provide any financial help to my relatives in Ukraine. Even travel to the mainland is a struggle. I can’t visit Kiev because I’m afraid that border guards might take away my passport or kick me off the train. We’re paying more for food and rent. Clothing prices in Crimea have soared, and we no longer have access to clothes from Europe. Additionally, some important medication that was already scarce has became much more difficult to obtain. These challenges haven’t prevented me from working as a front-end developer for the New York-based startup, Skillcrush, an interactive learning community that teaches women how to become developers. In fact, it’s made me even more appreciative of the kind of stability I’m able to provide for my family. At Skillcrush, I work comfortably from home—4,660 miles from my New York colleagues—using HipChat and GitHub to collaborate with the team. I’m living in a world where border wars still erupt, but technology allows me to feel like I’m in the same room with someone despite being thousands of miles away. I’m constantly amazed that I can have the opportunity to contribute to a U.S. company without uprooting my entire life.

(Mike Mullaney)  When I was working as a freelancer for companies in my country, I spent time every day searching for new projects. I could find work, but the pay was not good. That’s not stable for a woman with a child. Now, through PowerToFly, I have a salary that allows me to support my family and face the new financial challenges of living in Crimea. I have a 5-year-old son named Vladik. He wants to be a superhero and loves transformers. Right now, he’s living with my mom about an hour away in a coastal region of Crimea called Partenit because she is sick and doesn’t want to be alone. This July, I was shocked when a CT scan showed my mother had a dangerous lung cancer. She needed chemo right away, but she couldn’t start until September, because we had to wait for a place in the chemo clinic. She can’t work now, so I help her with money and drive her to the clinic on weekends. Without my son with her, I worry she would slip into depression because of her cancer. Because of him, she’s waking up each morning, going for a walk with him and cooking for him. Before we knew about her disease, we were going to send Vladik to kindergarten in Simferopol, but we hired a tutor who’s preparing him for kindergarten instead. I’m constantly sick because of my weak nervous system. I loved living in Kiev, but the cold winter weather there gave me chronic bronchitis. Last year, I had a case of bronchitis that lasted almost two months! I’m much better now that we moved, and I’m trying to take better care of my health. It helps that I don’t have to worry as much about my sickness interfering with my income. For me, working remotely makes all this manageable. Freedom is very important to me, which is why I was so appreciative to find my job at Skillcrush through PowerToFly. It improved my whole environment. I have free time when I need it. I can work and be with my child or my mother without needing a day off. If I’m sick, but feel well enough, I can work from bed without using any sick leave. PowerToFly even offered to provide daycare for my son, gave me a loan for a laptop and helped me with a vacation request when my mom got sick. Despite ongoing challenges, my day-to-day life is pretty normal. Each morning, I wake up and kiss my husband and then call my son. At breakfast, I read a book to help me relax. After that, I check my e-mails. Every morning is like a new surprise, because before going to sleep I write an e-mail to my manager to see what she needs me to work on, and each morning I see an answer with new task. I don’t know if I really have achieved work-life balance. Cleaning doesn’t always get done. I save time on cooking by using my microwave and pressure-cooker. I grocery shop at a store that’s a five-minute walk from my house. My husband works remotely also, so we are usually home all day working until late evening. After dinner, I read or watch a movie. My long-term goal is to improve my skills in JavaScript, English and management so that one day I can relocate to Canada or the United States. Now that I know there’s a good chance my mother won’t live long, I’m not sure if I’ll have the opportunity to do that in the next five years. But over these past few months, I’ve learned in some sense everything’s possible if you just try and believe in yourself. Marie Elizabeth Oliver is an editor at PowerToFly, working from New Orleans. She was formerly an editor at The Washington Post. Julia Kits is a global talent manager and developer for PowerToFly, based in Taganrog, Russia.

The Washington Post,L,"The problem with the U.S. policy of no ransoms? Hostage rescues are very, very difficult. - The Washington Post"," By Adam Taylor December 4 at 4:44 PM  Follow @mradamtaylor      A Black Hawk helicopter prepares to land in the Pachir Wa Agam district of Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, in April 2013. (Noorullah Shirzada/AFP/Getty Images)  Last week, U.S. Special Operation forces headed to a cave in Hagr al-Saiaar, a remote area of Yemen for a rare on-the-ground intervention in the Middle Eastern nation. They were taking part in a rescue mission and hoped to free a number of hostages chained up in the cage and kept prisoner by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a particularly feared al Qaeda offshoot. The rescue mission was not a success. While eight hostages were freed after a firefight that left all the kidnappers dead, five hostages who were expected to be in the cave were not there. According to a a member of Yemen's anti-terrorism force quoted on a Web site connected to Yemen's defense ministry, these five hostages included an American and a Briton. Less than a week later, AQAP released a video that appeared to show the American hostage, a 33-year-old freelance photographer named Luke Sommers. Sommers was filmed pleading for his life, while an al-Qaeda official said that Somers will meet his “inevitable fate” unless demands are met by the U.S. government.      The White House admitted on Thursday that a hostage rescue mission last month in Yemen failed to liberate American Luke Somers because he was not present at the targeted location. (AP)   While its unclear what the demands are, it's unlikely they will be met. The United States has a policy of refusing to pay ransoms to terrorists and rarely negotiates with them. Rescue missions like last week's are one of the few options left for the U.S. government when dealing with Americans being held hostage abroad. The big problem is that these rescues can be very difficult to pull off. Another recent failed rescue sounds remarkably similar to the case in Yemen. As Adam Goldman and Karen DeYoung reported for The Washington Post back in August, several dozen U.S. commandos were sent to Syria last summer to try to rescue American hostages being held by the Islamic State. It was the first known U.S. ground operation in Syria since the country’s civil war started. An official told The Post that the effort “was not ultimately successful because the hostages were not present . . . at the site of the operation.” The operation was only revealed after video was released of the killing of James Foley, one of the Americans who was being held. Both the rescue operation in Yemen and the one in Syria apparently failed due to problems with the intelligence used to plan the raids, a recurring issue for rescue teams in hostile foreign environments. Another big problem is that it can be hard to protect the hostages while fighting their captors: Linda Norgrove, a Scottish aid worker kidnapped by the Taliban in 2010, was killed during the U.S. operation to rescue her. A joint investigation between the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that a grenade thrown by a member of the rescue team had killed Norgrove. Even in successful raids, the rescuers may well end up dead themselves. These rescue missions may well cost more than many ransom demands. ""In terms of cost, this is almost going to be an impossible figure,"" Brian Michael Jenkins, a Senior Adviser to the Rand Corporation President and terrorism expert told The Post. ""It will depend on exactly how you want to do the accounting."" Jenkins said that estimates could range between hundreds of thousands in the minimum to tens of millions of dollars, though he cautioned that cost wasn't the issue. ""It is not a matter of cost effectiveness,"" Jenkins says. The United States is far from alone in finding hostage rescue attempts extremely difficult. In 2013, French commandos failed to rescue intelligence agent Denis Allex from his Somalian captors, and Allex was executed in response. A 2012 attempt to rescue a Briton and his Italian colleague from Nigeria's Boko Haram failed when their captors killed the hostages. Ultimately, hostage rescues are always going to be difficult. ""There's a lot of luck involved in this,"" Peter Ahearn, a former FBI agent, said of the failed attempt to rescue Foley last summer. ""But you'd rather be lucky than good in some of these things."" In popular culture, however, the successful hostage rescues are the ones that are well-known. Israelis are proud of the daring 1976 Operation Entebbe, which saw 102 hostages rescued in a Ugandan air field. The British love to talk about 1980s Iranian Embassy Siege in London, which saw all but one of the hostages being held rescued in front of live television cameras. Two of the biggest American films of the past few years, ""Captain Philips"" and ""Argo,"" dealt with successful U.S. hostage rescues. History is filled with failed attempts, too, however. The events depicted in ""Argo"" were preceded by one of the most notorious hostage rescue attempts ever: 1981's Operation Eagle Claw, a failed attempt to rescue diplomats being held in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran that ended in a helicopter crash in the desert that left eight troops dead. That was the first mission by the U.S. military’s Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, which often deals with hostages held by terror groups. Tactics have surely improved since then. Jenkins of Rand Corporation says that in 1980, almost 80 percent of U.S. hostage rescues resulted in at least one hostage dying. In the past few years, a little more than half of U.S. attempts were successful. That's still a high number, but given that the United States refuses to negotiate with terrorists, and that most Americans support that policy, there may be no better option. ""If a country is going to adopt a no ransom policy,"" Jenkins says, it must be willing to ""take every reasonable effort to bring about their release without making concessions, and that includes, when feasible, a rescue attempt."""
The Washington Post,L,"For Jay Gruden, the best place for Robert Griffin III is elsewhere - The Washington Post","     Despite a decent performance, Colt McCoy could not pull out a victory for the Redskins, as they lost, 49-27, against the Indianapolis Colts. The Washington Post's Gene Wang and Dan Steinberg discuss how the lackluster defense was mostly to blame. (Kyle Barss/The Washington Post)      By Jason Reid Columnist December 4 at 10:41 AM  Follow @JReidPost     Jay Gruden wanted Robert Griffin III to succeed, but he felt he had no choice last week other than to bench the Washington Redskins’ once-apparent franchise savior despite the wide-ranging consequences. And while it’s unclear whether owner Dan Snyder and President and General Manager Bruce Allen are in lockstep with their coach, it’s helpful to examine what convinced Gruden that the franchise must part ways with the 2012 offensive rookie of the year. By making the bold move, Gruden has set the tone about Griffin’s future as the offseason draws near, and the power of Gruden’s assessment will be crucial as he tries to persuade Snyder and Allen to follow him. Although Gruden had doubts about Griffin before coming to Washington in January, Griffin was his unquestioned starter from the offseason workouts through training camp to Week 1 of this season. After working with Griffin for more than 10 months, however, Gruden is now done with him, according to multiple people within the organization.  Jason Reid is a sports columnist with the Washington Post. He joined the Post’s Redskins team in 2007 after 15 years covering many beats at the Los Angeles Times. View Archive   Google+ RSS   Through three preseason games and five starts in the regular season, Gruden has seen enough to realize that Griffin is at best a long-term project as a pocket passer. Griffin was too deliberate reading defenses, displayed poor footwork and an alarming lack of pocket presence for a signal-caller in his third NFL season. Also, Gruden’s assessment goes deeper than Griffin’s play. He has major concerns about Griffin’s decision making off the field, which has come to light through conversations with team officials at Redskins Park. To Gruden, Griffin seemed more concerned about enhancing his brand than about honing his pocket skills. Often, Gruden rolled his eyes after being informed about the life lessons the 24-year-old offered on social media. Gruden became frustrated that Griffin, even after Gruden benched him, failed to acknowledge his role in his failure.         1 of 37       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                       Skip Ad   ×           NFL Week 13: Washington loses to Indianapolis, 49-27    View Photos   Redskins drop to 3-9.

But despite Griffin’s awful performance — he hasn’t won a game in more than a year while being benched in successive seasons — the situation may not be so clear-cut for Snyder and Allen, who had key roles in the decision to trade four high-round draft picks for the opportunity to select Griffin. It wouldn’t be surprising if Snyder and Allen were tempted to give Griffin another shot at reclaiming the starting job. Or they could take a hard-line approach in trade talks, hoping to recoup a portion of the king’s ransom it took to get Griffin. In either scenario, the Redskins would wind up as losers. In the NFL, the head coach-quarterback relationship is the most important on the team. A productive one can help provide the foundation of a championship organization. Conversely, it’s a bad idea to force a coach to work with a quarterback in whom he has no confidence. If Gruden were merely aggravated about Griffin’s miscues, Gruden could work through that. Early in Brett Favre’s career with the Green Bay Packers, Mike Holmgren often wanted to strangle Favre for his blockheaded play. During their days with the New York Giants, Bill Parcells repeatedly blasted Phil Simms on the sidelines. Terry Bradshaw and Chuck Noll had such a contentious union that they barely spoke for 20 years after Bradshaw retired. But Holmgren, Parcells and Noll all believed that they were working with quarterbacks capable of achieving greatness. Gruden does not share that view about Griffin. If Griffin were willing to remain in the background, perhaps Gruden could tolerate having him on the roster as a backup next season. But Griffin craves attention. The spotlight always finds him — or he makes sure it does. The belief around the league is that for Griffin to have any hope of reviving his career, he must get his priorities in order. To say the least, the Redskins won’t have a ton of leverage in trying to trade Griffin. Considering Gruden’s firm stance, though, trading Griffin is the logical option. And if Snyder and Allen drag their feet or tell Gruden he must give Griffin one more chance, then Gruden may have to come up with an exit strategy even faster than Mike Shanahan did. Realizing he faces a formidable challenge, Gruden is eager to roll up his sleeves. To help Gruden get the job done, Snyder and Allen should remove the albatross around his neck.

Footage released by Abu Dhabi police shows the suspect fleeing the scene and the subsequent operation to arrest her. (YouTube: theabudhabipolice)   Police have arrested an Emirati woman suspected of brutally stabbing an American woman to death in the bathroom of an Abu Dhabi mall. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sheik Saif bin Zayed announced the arrest on Thursday, according to the National, an Abu Dhabi news organization. Police released video footage of the operation that appears to show a woman being detained at her home. Not long after the fatal mall attack on Monday, the suspect allegedly planted a makeshift bomb outside of the home of an Egyptian American doctor, according to the National. The bomb was dismantled, and police discovered bomb-making materials in the suspect's home during the arrest. ""We dealt with it under high security measures after the building was evacuated. Similar components [or substances] were found later at the suspect’s house,"" said Humaid al-Afreet, head of the explosives and weapons department, according to the National. The victim, a 37-year-old kindergarten teacher and mother of 11-year-old twins, was attacked in the Boutik Mall on the upscale Reem Island. Abu Dhabi, the capital city of United Arab Emirates, is a popular destination for Americans and other Westerners. Police first released surveillance footage of a suspect who was wearing a black abaya (a traditional women's robe covering the entire body),  black gloves and and a niqab that covered her entire face, except for her eyes. The suspect was shown arriving at and then fleeing the scene of the crime. But authorities initially could not say whether the person under the bulky robe was a woman or a man. Additional video footage released Thursday show what appears to be the woman's car with a UAE flag used to conceal the license plate. Police also released a photo of what appeared to be blood covering the steering wheel. A large knife covered in blood also was photographed at the scene.      The interior minister of the United Arab Emirates said on Thursday that police have arrested a female suspect in the stabbing death of an American schoolteacher. (AP)   There is still not any word about a motive, but the arrest and the discovery of a bomb at another American's home suggest that they were targeted. Fears have been growing for Westerners overseas in light of the stepped-up campaign to thwart the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The United States, the UAE and a coalition of other countries have participated in airstrikes against the terrorist group. In response, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, an Islamic State spokesman, incited attacks against Westerners in a statement on Dec. 1 -- the same day of the stabbing incident in Abu Dhabi, according to Agence France-Presse. In October, the U.S. Embassy and the UAE posted a statement saying that a call for attacks on American teachers in the region had been posted on a jihadist Web forum, but that there was no credible evidence that there was a plot afoot, according to Reuters. Asked whether this week's events were considered a terrorist attack, Rashid Borshid of the police's Criminal Investigation Department said, according to Reuters, that ""this is under investigation now, and I cannot say yes or no now."" Random crime is relatively rare in the UAE, and the federation has sought to be a haven for Westerners at a time of tumult in the Middle East. The State Department currently does not have any travel warnings or alerts for the UAE. The swift effort to solve this mystery -- and to document it with heavily produced video footage -- shows how important the government believes it is to allay fears of blatant crimes against Westerners. “Today, we are before a heinous crime the likes of which are unprecedented in our safe country,” the interior minister said, according to the National. “It is a crime that goes against all human values and norms. It was a blatant attack on innocent people that committed no wrongdoing, killing a teacher that worked with future generations and whom everyone recognized as a hard-working and devoted teacher."" "
The Washington Post,L,"The remarkable collapse of our trust in government, in one chart - The Washington Post"," By Chris Cillizza December 4 at 10:31 AM  Follow @thefix   No one likes  -- or trusts -- the government. At this point, that's accepted conventional wisdom. And most people assume it has always been like that. (We have a tendency to assume whatever is happening to us right now has always been happening.) But that lack of trust hasn't always been a part of the American experience -- as this awesome chart from our friends at the Pew Research Center shows. The line below charts the percentage of people who have told Pew they trust the government ""just about always"" or ""most of the time"".     The downward trajectory is stark. The collapse began during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, which, not coincidentally, overlapped with the Vietnam War.  The 1970s -- thanks to Vietnam and Watergate -- sped up the loss of faith in the government.  And, after a quasi-resurgence during the 1980s, the trend line for the past few decades is quite clear. With the exception of relatively brief spikes that overlap with the first Gulf War and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the number of people who trust the government has been steadily declining; the last time Pew asked the question, in February, just 24 percent said they trust the government ""always"" or ""most of the time"". Exit polling from the 2014 midterms makes clear that things haven't improved in the trust department since that Pew poll.  Just 20 percent said they trusted the government to do what's right ""always"" or ""most"" of the time, while 79 percent said they trusted the government only ""some"" of the time or ""never."" The collapse of our collective trust in the government -- and, by extension, its ability or willingness to help solve problems -- has massive reverberations for politicians. They are considered less-than-honest brokers by large numbers of the American public, meaning that everything they say or do is viewed with suspicion.  That's a tough starting place for any pol. But, if the chart above is any indication, it's the new normal."
The Washington Post,L,The White House celebrates the holidays with a tree too big to fit through the door - The Washington Post," By Jura Koncius December 3  Follow @jurakoncius        President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama wish Americans a happy and healthy holiday season. (YouTube/The White House)   The holidays at the White House this year brought the front door down. At Wednesday’s preview of the 2014 White House decorations for military families, Michelle Obama confessed that the 18-foot-tall, 12-foot-wide Blue Room fir barely made it inside to be trimmed with 2,000 ornaments, many made by military children. “Have you guys seen the biggest, hugest tree? Have you seen it? I think this is the biggest tree we’ve had,” said Michelle Obama to her 140 guests in the East Room. She explained that the official White House Christmas tree was “so big that we had to take the hinges off of the front door and take the doors off — literally — just to get this tree in.” Now that the door is securely back on, the Obamas are set to welcome some 65,000 visitors to the White House during the 2014 holiday season. Those visitors will get to see the 420-pound gingerbread White House and the 26 trees that are set up around the tour route and the boxwood trellises and garlanded mantels.          1 of 19       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                       Skip Ad   ×           White House 2014 holiday decorations    View Photos   Michelle Obama unveils the “A Children’s Winter Wonderland” to military families.

The theme “A Children’s Winter Wonderland” clearly brought out the glue guns and gallons of glitter. The Grand Foyer and Cross Hall had suspended snowflake and star ornaments and trees decorated in hanging-glass ornaments. Vintage luggage was stacked up in front of the windows of the State Dining Room and dusted with silvery white glitter. Outside in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, a huge mirrored gift box reflected the light. In the Vermeil Room, where portraits of several first ladies hang, volunteers took two dress mannequins and created evergreen skirts to look like ball gowns, then embellished them with frosted decorations and lights. New York designer Alexis Bittar, whose jewelry has been worn by Michelle Obama, created ornaments and necklaces for the installation, including hand-sculpted designs made of Lucite ivory pine cones interwoven with vintage brooches. One of the volunteer decorators, part of a team of 106 people who worked for five days, was Frank Champa from Brooks, Maine, who happens to be a costume designer. “The first lady wanted to do something different here,” Champa said. He found the whole experience amazing. “My grandfather was a florist in the White House,” Champa said. “It was just surreal to be here. I actually sat down and cried a little.”    First lady Michelle Obama decorates crafts and cookies with military families’ children during the 2014 White House holiday preview. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Obama, dressed in an eggplant-colored dress and glittery necklace, thanked the troops, veterans, wounded warriors and military spouses, saying “your presence here today is a powerful reminder for all of us what this season is really all about,” rousing the audience with her prepared remarks. “It’s really about serving others,” she said. “It’s about giving more than we receive and it’s about showing those we love how much they mean to us.” The children at the event knew it’s also about something else. “Are you guys ready to get up and move?,” the first lady asked her young guests. “You’re going to come with me, we’re going to do some decorating. We’ve got the stuff — I think we may have cookies or something.” (“Yay!” yelled out one bold child.) And with that, Obama was off to the State Dining Room with girls in full-skirted party dresses, boys in red wool vests and toddlers clutching sippy cups trailing behind her. Here, they would have their own taste of the DIY-movement supervised by three very experienced crafters: White House chief floral designer Laura Dowling, executive chef Cristeta Comerford and new executive pastry chef Susan Morrison. The children moved right to their tasks: cookies to drench in frosting, snowflake ornaments to dust with colored salts and Bo and Sunny coloring books to fill in. While Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush would often take questions from the press at the preview about where they were spending their holidays or what their family traditions were, Obama has stuck to a scripted program in each of her six years hosting this preview. Each first lady puts her own stamp on the decorations. In the 1990s, Clinton didn’t have any tech surprises, but she did round up a roster of design celebrities to help with the decorating: Martha Stewart, Christopher Radko, Ralph Lauren’s creative stylists and Robert Isabell, the late New York party planner and flower designer. Bush brought us LED lights and Barney Cam, a popular series of holiday videos starring the photogenic Scottish terrier as he romped through the White House. The Obamas may not be sharing any information about their holiday plans, but they have posted the first interactive White House holiday card, available to anyone at www.whitehouse.gov.

The Washington Post,L,Bill Cosby’s honorary title revoked by U.S. Navy - The Washington Post," By Amy Argetsinger December 4 at 2:30 PM  Follow @AmyArgetsinger      Bill Cosby, center, is recognized as an honorary Chief Petty Officer by Master Chief Petty Officer Rick West, left, and Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus on Feb. 17, 2011. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)  The thing about honorary titles is that they’re just that –  honorary. They come with no salary, no responsibilities, just clap on the back and maybe a plaque. So even when the honoree turns out to be less than worthy, usually no demotion is in order. But the U.S. Navy is taking the honorary title it bestowed upon Bill Cosby in 2011 very seriously — seriously enough to revoke it. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Michael Stevens announced Thursday that they are revoking Cosby’s title of honorary Chief Petty Officer after multiple accusations of sexual abuse by the comedian made news. In a press release, officials explained that “the Navy is taking this action because allegations against Mr. Cosby are very serious and are in conflict with the Navy’s core values of honor, courage and commitment.” Cosby served for four years in the Navy as a young man, never making it past hospital corpsman third-class. But his fond recollections of his long-ago service impressed military brass. In September 2010, he accepted a Lone Sailor Award from U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation, which annually honors vets who achieved greatness in their post-military careers. The often-cantankerous comedian delighted the gala crowd by unexpectedly doing several minutes of stand-up about his sailor days. Five months later, he returned to Washington and did an extended version of that riff for an audience of both enlisted folks and brass at the Navy Memorial. In a brief ceremony, Mabus and Rick West, who then held the post of master chief petty officer, attached shoulderboards to his shirt, signifying that he was a CPO, and helped him into a dress blue jacket. Of course, the military, too, has grappled with a wave of sexual assault reports that have been under close scrutiny from the White House and Congress recently; and as other organizations cut their affiliations with Cosby, the military community was buzzing last week about his Navy connections. Navy officials did not respond to the Post’s Checkpoint blog for comment last Friday. Here’s the full statement released by the Navy on Thursday: Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Michael Stevens today said the Navy is revoking Bill Cosby’s title of honorary Chief Petty Officer, originally presented in 2011. The Navy is taking this action because allegations against Mr. Cosby are very serious and are in conflict with the Navy’s core values of honor, courage and commitment. Cosby enlisted in the Navy in 1956 and served for four years as a hospital corpsman before being honorably discharged in 1960 as a 3rd Class Petty Officer.   See earlier on Checkpoint blog: Former sailor Bill Cosby and the Navy have history together. Now it’s complicated.  "
The Washington Post,L,"This flu season could be a bad one, CDC says - The Washington Post"," By Lenny Bernstein December 4 at 3:48 PM  Follow @LennyMBernstein      A flu virus binds to cells in the respiratory tract. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)  This post has been updated. Anticipating a severe flu season, the government on Thursday recommended immediate vaccination for anyone who hasn't taken that precaution and urged people who come down with the flu to seek anti-viral medication from their doctors. The flu has already killed five children, and the predominant strain of the virus circulating now was associated with severe outbreaks, including larger than normal numbers of deaths and hospitalizations, during three flu seasons over the past 11 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced. The anti-viral medications oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be particularly important this year. A CDC study of the flu viruses now circulating showed that the vaccine may have limited effectiveness against more than half of the most common one, H3N2, the CDC said. Yet fewer than 1 in 6 people infected by the flu virus are treated with anti-viral medications, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. Anti-viral drugs ""aren't a substitute for vaccine. Vaccine prevents flu,"" Frieden said. ""But anti-virals are an important second line of defense … and this year treatment with anti-viral drugs is especially important."" That is particularly true for children under age 2, adults older than 65, pregnant women and people with other health conditions that leave them more vulnerable to the flu, including asthma, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Residents of nursing homes and the morbidly obese also should receive the treatment. Frieden noted that anti-viral drugs work best if they are taken within two days of infection and urged patients and doctors to turn to them quickly. He also emphasized that people with the flu should stay home to avoid spreading it. Before each flu season, experts try to predict the kinds of virus that will circulate in the United States and drug companies produce vaccines with three or four components to combat them. But the effort is always something of a guessing game and this year, tests  are finding that more than half the H3N2 viruses are antigenically different from the vaccine component, or ""drifted"" from it, in CDC parlance. The vaccine still should provide some protection against those viruses and will be effective against the others, according to the CDC. The ""drifted"" virus was first detected in March, too late to be included in this season's vaccine, Frieden said. H3N2 viruses predominated during the flu seasons of 2003-2004, 2007-2008 and 2012-2013, when the largest number of deaths were recorded over the past decade. The flu is still at low levels in the United States, but 1,228 confirmed cases were reported to the CDC during the week that ended Nov. 22. ""The flu is unpredictable,"" Frieden said. This is ""likely to be an H3N2 predominant season … and H3N2 predominant seasons tend to have more hospitalizations and more deaths."" "

The Washington Post,L,The racial divide in America is this elemental: Blacks and whites actually breathe different air. - The Washington Post," By Max Ehrenfreund December 4 at 10:49 AM  Follow @MaxEhrenfreund      American Lung Association  There's a profound truth to one of the mottoes of protesters in New York who are upset about a grand jury's decision not to indict an officer in the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island this summer. ""We can't breathe,"" they have been chanting. And in New York, as in most American cities, the air itself has been tainted by decades of disparity in public policy. The motto paraphrases Garner's words as Officer Daniel Pantaleo held him in an apparent chokehold on the sidewalk. Pantaleo told the grand jury he did not intend to choke Garner and tried to let go of him when Garner said, ""I can't breathe,"" but the asthmatic Garner suffered a heart attack and died several minutes later in the back of ambulance. A medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. We'll never know if Garner would have survived the altercation if he hadn't had asthma. We also don't know what caused the asthma, which he developed as a child. What we do know is that asthma is much more common among blacks than whites, and that air pollution is much worse in communities of color nationwide. Asthma was one among many factors correlated with race in Garner's life that led to the fatal situation, said Eddie Bautista, director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance. ""There are number of ways that racism plays out,"" he said. ""The asthma is just one more example."" A recent study found that members of racial and ethnic minorities are exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide, a common pollutant associated with asthma and heart disease, that are 38 percent higher than in the air whites breathe. Advocates say that authorities often decide to dump waste in minority neighborhoods, and to locate highways and industrial facilities away from the higher-income areas where whites live. Garner lived in Tompkinsville, a neighborhood on Staten Island's north shore where zoning regulations have concentrated shipping and industry, Bautista said. The north shore of the island is one of six areas that New York City has designated for marine freight. Bautista's group analyzed the demographics of these zones and found that about two-thirds of the people living in them were not white. Historically, he said, immigrants and people of color moved to these waterfront neighborhoods because they could live and find work there despite a lack of money and qualifications. More recently, as the city has converted industrial land elsewhere into gentrifying residential and commercial neighborhoods, industry has further concentrated in the waterfront districts, likely leading to more asthma-causing pollutants. ""The more industrial land you take off the table, the less land you have, the greater the potential for clustering. It's a vicious cycle,"" Bautista said. In one neighborhood, Hunts Point and Mott Haven in the Bronx, the rate at which children are hospitalized for asthma is about twice the city's average. Pollution is not the only cause of asthma. Psychological factors play a role as well, including anxiety, stress and exposure to violence. Children who live in neighborhoods where crime is high have been shown to have higher rates of asthma. For people living in old, poorly maintained houses, exposure to cockroaches is another risk: the insects produce allergens that might cause asthma in children.  "
The Washington Post,L,"New York Mayor, police union officials clash after grand jury decision in Eric Garner’s death - The Washington Post"," By Elahe Izadi December 4 at 5:48 PM  Follow @ElaheIzadi      New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks at a press conference after watching police being retrained with new guidelines at the Police Academy on Thursday in Queens. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)  Tensions between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and some in the city’s police force came into full view Thursday, as police union officials accused the mayor of throwing the department “under the bus” in his response to a grand jury’s decision to not indict a white officer in Eric Garner’s killing. “Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,” Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said at a Thursday press conference. “Look, last night, the protesters — we may not agree with their message, but we were protecting their right to do it. That’s what they should be saying.” De Blasio pushed back, thanking protesters for an “overwhelmingly” peaceful protest on Wednesday night that resulted in 83 arrests, and praising officers. “The response by the New York Police Department was exactly the right one. It was smart, it was strategic, it was agile. A lot of restraint was shown,” the mayor said as he announced a massive refresher training for the nation’s largest police force in the wake of Garner’s death. “This is a sign of respect for the profession of policing,” de Blasio said of the training. “We put so many other professions on a pedestal and put a huge amount on training. This is a profession that deserves more support.” RELATED: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio pens an open letter after the Eric Garner decision: ‘There is much more to be done.’ Starting this month, all 20,000 members of the city’s patrol force, including 2,500 sergeants and 900 lieutenants, will undergo a three-day training course that will include learning conflict-resolution skills and how to deescalate situations with methods other than force. “Fundamental questions are being asked, and rightfully so, about how we respect people’s rights, how we reduce the use of force and the relationship between police and community,” de Blasio said. The mayor declined to comment on whether such training would avoid a repeat of what happened between Garner and Officer Daniel Pantaleo, but he said that it will lead to “a very different reality.” “This will protect our officers, protect lives of our citizens,” de Blasio said. “I have no doubt that some tragedies will be averted because of this training.”    A man distributes fliers to police officers at a protest in New York’s Union Square on Wednesday. (Kena Betancur/Getty Images)  After the grand jury declined to bring charges against Pantaleo, de Blasio met with clergy and others in Staten Island on Wednesday and then spoke about his personal fear that his African American son would fall victim to police brutality. Lynch said Thursday that the mayor instead should have been telling residents to not resist arrest because it can lead to dangerous and sometimes tragic outcomes for officers and civilians alike. An internal department review will begin into whether Pantaleo violated department conduct policies, just as the Justice Department launches a civil rights probe into the death of Garner, a 43-year-old unarmed black man, which was captured on video obtained by the Daily News and sparked mass outrage and an eventual investigation. A judge also ordered the release of a very limited amount of information about the grand jury investigation, per a request from Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan. That information includes the fact that jurors sat for a period of nine weeks; heard from 50 witnesses, with 22 being civilians and the rest officers, emergency personnel and doctors; and considered 60 exhibits, which included four videos. The judge noted that much of that information had already been widely reported in the media.      The president of the union that represents New York City police officers praised Wednesday's grand jury decision in Staten Island not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the choking death of Eric Garner last summer. (AP)   Donovan had not asked for transcripts of testimony or the exhibits to be made public. In a statement, Donovan said he had no further comment on the grand jury investigation. Union officials and de Blasio did agree on one thing: that more information related to the grand jury decision should be released. Pantaleo “has no qualms if that information is released, because it’s the truth,” Lynch said. “He would like everyone to hear what the grand jurors heard.” "

The Washington Post,L,Expect large crowds for downtown events - The Washington Post," By Robert Thomson December 4 at 9:15 AM  Follow @RT_Thomson    Two separate events near each other in the heart of downtown Washington will put crowds on the streets and add to traffic congestion, particularly during the Thursday afternoon rush. Many Metrobus routes will be detoured or delayed. Drivers who just want to get through the area should steer clear of the John A. Wilson Building (“A” on the map) on Pennsylvania Avenue and the Ellipse (“B” on the map) south of the White House. Here are the travel details for each event. John A. Wilson Building The body of former D.C. mayor Marion Barry will lie in repose at the Wilson Building until midnight in the first of three days of remembrance ceremonies. The Wilson Building is on the south side of Freedom Plaza, on Pennsylvania Avenue between 13th and 14th streets NW. See more from Mike DeBonis about plans for the memorials. Metrorail is likely to be the easiest approach for those attending. The stations nearest to the Wilson Building are Federal Triangle and Metro Center. This page on the Parking Panda Web site can help drivers who want to find and reserve garage parking nearby. The transit authority said it expects the activity around the Wilson Building to disrupt service on these Metrobus routes: 30N, 30S, 32, 33, 36, 37, 39, A9, D1, P17, P19, W13. See this page on Metro’s Web site for details on route changes and skipped stops. The Ellipse The annual lighting ceremony for the National Christmas Tree is set to begin at 4:30 p.m. on the Ellipse. The event usually lasts till about 7 p.m. Several street closings for the event setup are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. Thursday and continue till 10 p.m. The streets to be closed are 15th and 17th between Constitution Avenue and E Street NW. This alone would be enough to disrupt the evening rush hour, but those closings will be extended from 4 p.m. through the end of the ceremony. During those hours, 15th Street NW will be blocked to vehicles between New York and Constitution avenues, 17th Street NW will be blocked between Constitution Avenue and New York Avenue/State Place, and 18th Street NW will be closed to vehicles between D and E streets. The diverted traffic will make congestion even worse than normal throughout the area near the White House and Ellipse. The nearest Metrorail stations are McPherson Square, Farragut West, Metro Center and Federal Triangle. For paid parking options in the vicinity, check this page on Parking Panda. But remember that the closer you get to the Ellipse, the more likely you are to be caught in extra heavy rush hour traffic. Metrobus delays because of the extra traffic can be widespread, affecting routes that link the District with Maryland and Virginia. The transit authority expects these routes will be subject to delays and unplanned detours: 3Y, 7Y, 11Y, 16X, 16Y, 30N, 30S, 32, 36, 37, 38B, 39, 42, 43, 52, 53, 54, 80, D1, D3, D5, D6, G8, H1, L1, N2, N3, N4, P6, P17, P19, S1, S2, S4, S9, W13, X1 and X2. Routes H1, L1 and N3 will begin service at C and 18th streets NW. The X1 will begin service at the 10th Street terminal. Routes 11Y, G8, P17, P19, W13 and X2 will begin service at Franklin Square. Some S2 and S4 buses will turn back near Franklin Square. See more details about the disrupted schedules on Metro’s Web site. The OmniRide commuter bus service plans to make these adjustments on Thursday afternoon: Beginning at 2 p.m., buses will pick up passengers only from the Franconia-Springfield Metro station for eastern Prince William County and at Tysons Corner Metro station for Manassas, Gainesville and Linton Hall. All the regular drop-off points will be served. Service from the Metro stations will continue until 7:30 p.m. except for Prince William and Manassas Metro Direct buses, which will continue operating until their last published departure time. The Maryland Transit Administration advises its riders to expect significant delays through downtown, especially on routes near the White House and the Wilson Building."
The Washington Post,L,"Plunging oil prices spell trouble for Alaska, America’s own petro-state - The Washington Post"," By Steven Mufson December 4 at 10:10 AM  Follow @StevenMufson      Low oil prices are bringing a mountain of budget troubles to Alaska's state government.  (Photo by Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)  What U.S. state is as hooked on oil revenues as Venezuela, Iran, or Russia? Alaska. Plunging oil prices have blown a huge hole in the budget of the oil-rich state, where in recent years taxes on oil production have covered more than half the total budget ($13.5 billion including federal funds and capital projects) and 90 percent of the state's discretionary spending ($6.5 billion to run agencies and schools). Now, with prices under $70 a barrel, the budget deficit could balloon to more than $3 billion, about half of the state’s discretionary spending level. In his inaugural address earlier this week, Gov. Bill Walker recounted his impoverished childhood and his family’s determination to make ends meet after losing almost everything in the 1964 earthquake. It was an allegory for Alaska's current situation. “Today, oil is hovering around $70 a barrel,” he said. “We’re heading into some lean times. There is no reason we cannot turn that around.” Turning it around could be difficult. Ever since the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field starting production in 1977, Alaska has relied heavily on oil revenues. Les Gara, a member of the Alaska state legislature, said that the oil price would have to hit $110 a barrel for the state government to break even. ""No one wants to pay high prices for gasoline, but at the same time we want to fund our roads and schools and opportunities for young people,"" Gara said. Alaskans, especially those in remote areas, pay some of the highest prices in the country for basic goods, such as milk or gasoline. And before oil prices jumped to record high levels over the past four years, Alaska was running far behind on maintenance projects and provided little education aid for its residents. ""While low oil prices are very good for consumers whether in rural Alaska where people rely on diesel fuel or across the country, it is terrible for finding ways to fund disadvantaged kids, foster youth programs, or pre-kindergarten education,"" said Gara. ""So it’s a mixed bag for Alaskans."" The new governor Walker has said he would review several controversial expensive projects such as the Knik Arm Bridge, Juneau Access, and Susitna Dam. He also favors taking federal money for Medicaid, which his predecessor opposed. But don't cry for Alaska too much. The state has built up three different rainy day funds — two of which are dedicated to covering deficits in lean years and the third a sacrosanct $51 billion Permanent Fund, which every year writes checks to every person living in Alaska. On Oct. 2, payments of $1,884 each were paid out. The wisdom of building up such funds was supposed to make Alaska look more like Norway, which has a huge oil-financed investment fund, and less like Venezuela. However, the Permanent Fund is not supposed to be touched to fill budget gaps; it is supposed to help Alaskan families as production in Prudhoe Bay declines. And the two rainy day funds are running a little dry. The Constitutional Budget Reserve was worth $11.8 billion on Oct 31 and the Statutory Budget Reserve was worth $3.7 billion. But the state legislature has voted to transfer $3 billion from those funds to cover part of a $12 billion gap in state's pension funds; Alaska has the seventh worst pension funding shortfall in the United States, according to a Bloomberg News report. Another $3 billion will go to cover the deficit in the fiscal year that will end June 2015. That will leave the Constitutional Budget Reserve with about $9.5 billion, barely more than the remaining pension fund shortfall. ""And that’s assuming today’s oil prices continue, which is a wild card,"" said Gara. "
The Washington Post,L,Many liberals and conservatives find themselves on common ground following the Garner decision - The Washington Post," By Katie Zezima December 4 at 7:45 PM  Follow @katiezez   Controversial court rulings are often followed by protests. Or confrontation. Or social unrest. This week's decision by a grand jury not to indict a New York City police officer in the death of a Staten Island man added an unexpected entry to the list: rare bipartisan consensus. Opinions on a grand jury's decision not to bring charges against a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager were largely split along party lines. Republicans generally approved the decision, while many Democrats did not. The political reaction to a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the death of Eric Garner, who died after the officer put him in a choke hold, has resulted in a rare consensus, with both conservatives and liberals reacting with outrage to the decision. ""There is no excuse that I can think of for choking a man to death for selling illegal cigarettes,"" wrote Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. ""This is someone being choked to death. We have it on video with the man pleading for his life. There is no excuse for that I can even contemplate or imagine right now."" Garner, who died July 17, was being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes on Staten Island. An officer, Daniel Pantaleo, used a chokehold to bring Garner down. His actions were caught on a video, with Garner repeatedly saying, ""I can't breathe."" He later died, and a medical examiner determined the chokehold and compression to Garner's chest had caused his death, which was ruled a homicide. Pantaleo told the grand jury that he had used a wrestling move and did not meant to cause Garner harm. The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Garner's death. So why has this case sparked outrage among some conservatives? First, there's the video evidence -- the dramatic footage showing Garner telling police that he cannot breathe. ""From looking at the video, the grand jury’s decision here is totally incomprehensible,"" conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said on FOX News Monday. Krauthammer also pointed to another source of conservative dissatisfaction with the case. ""[Garner] was selling loose cigarettes, which is in and of itself almost absurd that somebody has to die over that."" Conservatives oppose what they see as government over-regulation, and excessive taxation -- and to many of them, the Garner case represents both. More than a few on the right say the sale of loose, untaxed cigarettes should not be a crime, pointing to New York's extremely high cigarette tax, which has driven a sizable chunk of the market underground. New York City increased penalties for selling loose and untaxed tobacco earlier this year. The results of big government, #NannyStateEnforcement, and @MikeBloomberg ’s excise tax —> #EricGarner . Appalling and obscene. — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) December 3, 2014 The reaction on Capitol Hill has also been strikingly similar from many on both sides of the aisle. Clearly excessive force against #EricGarner. I pray that peace and justice will prevail. — Justin Amash (@repjustinamash) December 4, 2014  Sen. Rand Paul, speaking on ""Hardball"" Tuesday, said he was ""horrified"" by the video. But, as he did following the Ferguson decision, he placed much of the blame on politicians: those who enacted New York's high cigarette tax, and others who directed police to arrest those selling individual, tax-free cigarettes. On Wednesday he told CNN he was ""shocked"" by the grand jury's decision in New York.  ""I don't think it's justified what the police did, but I also think it's bad policy that puts the police in an untenable position. The War on Drugs"" -- which he pointed to in the Michael Brown case as well -- ""does that, and so does an erroneous and excessive tax policy as well,"" he said.  Rep. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-Wash.), the House's fourth-ranking Republican, said she thinks the body should hold hearings into Garner's death. “We all have a lot of serious questions that need to be addressed and we need to understand what happened, why this decision was made,” she said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Thursday. ""I would call for the House to have those hearings so that we can better understand. But we need to take action, appropriate action, making sure our local law enforcement have the training, that they're using appropriate force, which — I think we all recognize these are tragedies and it has raised a lot of questions."" Sean Davis at conservative publication The Federalist wrote, ""The grand jury’s decision not to bring any charges against the officer who killed Garner is inexplicable. It defies reason. It makes no sense.""  New York's Democratic congressional delegation railed against the decision.  ""The decision by a grand jury not to indict in the death of Eric Garner is a miscarriage of justice, it’s an outrage it’s a disgrace, it’s a blow to our democracy, and it should shock the conscience of every single American who cares about justice and fair play,"" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said. Noah Rothman, associate editor at hotair.com, noted the strikingly similar reactions coming from across the political spectrum -- at least for now.  This is one of those moments where left and right could unite. Few seem comfortable with this outcome. Unless recriminations start flying. — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) December 3, 2014       "
The Washington Post,L,New York police union official blames media over Eric Garner case - The Washington Post," By Erik Wemple December 4 at 7:12 PM  Follow @ErikWemple      Visitors gather at a memorial in Staten Island where Eric Garner died during an arrest in July. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)   MSNBC host Tamron Hall this morning interviewed Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, in an enlightening conversation about the case of 43-year-old Eric Garner, who died in July after a New York police department officer put him in a chokehold. The news yesterday that a Staten Island grand jury didn’t indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, has ignited protests and fresh questions about policing in American cities. Mullins told Hall that the current conversation over the case is missing something: “What’s not being discussed anywhere across the board is the totality of what’s involved in policing,” said the police union official. After discussing how the chokehold is banned under NYPD rules and other legal permutations of the case, Mullins said, “Unfortunately — this conversation you and I are having is covering a lot of ground related to the law — and a lot of media is not educating everyone as to what the law is, and what the duties of a police officer are. … Not to put any blame on any one individual, but in accordance with law, he was given a lawful order that he didn’t comply with.” Please, no media-bashing on the Eric Garner case. The only piece of media that matters here is the videotape that shows a white officer (Pantaleo) taking down an unarmed black man (Garner) over some petty offense (selling “loosie” cigarettes) in what should have been a routine and innocuous interaction.

The Washington Post,L,"Washington state man accused of making threats against Darren Wilson, ex-Ferguson cop who shot Michael Brown - The Washington Post"," By Sarah Larimer December 4 at 4:53 PM  Follow @slarimer      Officer Darren Wilson is pictured in this undated evidence photo from the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. (St. Louis County Prosecutor’s Office/Handout via Reuters)  About a week after a Missouri grand jury declined to indict a former police officer for the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager, a Washington state man has been arrested for making threats against the 28-year-old. “What this indicates is the need for vigilance,” attorney Neil Bruntrager told MSNBC in an interview this week, while discussing threats against his client. “And we’re going to maintain vigilance.” Bruntrager is an attorney for Darren Wilson, who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August. Brown’s death sparked unrest in the St. Louis suburb, which continued after the grand jury’s decision was announced in late November. Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department on Saturday, a few days before Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar was taken into custody for allegedly making threats against Wilson. “He takes them seriously,” Bruntrager said of any alleged threats against his client. “His concern is not for him, it’s for his family.” In the months after the shooting, few details of Wilson’s life were publicly known. Those tracking the case mostly knew him from a blurry photograph taken earlier this year. In recent days, he has participated in a televised interview, however, and more photos of Wilson circulated after grand jury documents were released. According to an eight-page complaint filed by the Department of Justice, Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, allegedly started posting about Ferguson on Facebook five days after the Brown shooting, and continued to post comments and news stories as the investigation continued. “Wanted For Murder of Mike Brown,” read a graphic that Abdul-Jabbaar posted in September, which showed Wilson in uniform, the complaint said. Under the graphic, Abdul-Jabbaar wrote: “This dude needs his house sprayed.” “We need to kill this white [expletive] and anything else that has a badge on,” Abdul-Jabbaar wrote on Facebook the day that the grand jury reached its decision, states the complaint, which identifies Wilson by his initials throughout. The complaint, filed before the U.S. District Court for Western District of Washington in Seattle, states that in November, Abdul-Jabbaar began posting that he wanted to go to Ferguson. The day the decision was announced, according to the complaint, he wrote: “Ready to go kill some cops.” Abdul-Jabbaar was arrested without incident at his home in Kirkland, Wash., about 22 minutes outside of Seattle, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington. “Although we each have the right to express our views about the decision reached by the state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, we cannot tolerate violence or threats of violence that are intended to intimidate, and ultimately silence debate,” acting U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes said in the release. “Such threats are crimes, and the individuals who make them must be held to account.” "
The Washington Post,L,Hagel says resignation followed series of conversations with president - The Washington Post," By Craig Whitlock December 4 at 3:19 PM  Follow @craigmwhitlock        Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday that he and President Obama had ""no major differences"" that led to his resignation. (AP)   Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday that he decided to resign after he and President Obama agreed that “fresh leadership” was needed at the Pentagon, but he dismissed reports that he was forced out or that there were rifts between him and the White House. “We both came to the conclusion that I think the country was best served with new leadership,” Hagel told reporters in his first extended remarks since he submitted his resignation Nov. 24, after less than two years in the job. “But I think you have to know when to leave, too.” Before Hagel’s comments on Thursday, neither he nor Obama had given a detailed explanation of what prompted his resignation, saying only that it was the culmination of a series of private discussions between the two leaders since October. White House aides have hinted that Obama had lost confidence in Hagel’s ability to oversee the war against the Islamic State and U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria. Hagel loyalists, meanwhile, have suggested that he had become fed up with White House officials trying to micromanage the Pentagon and that he felt his policy recommendations were being ignored. At Thursday’s press conference at the Pentagon, Hagel downplayed reports of discord, saying “there were no major differences in any major area. Sure, there are always issues of style, and how you get things done, and are things moving fast enough, but this country, as I’ve said, is well served to have a president like President Obama.” Still, Hagel steadfastly declined to elaborate on why he and Obama felt that new leadership was necessary, or to reveal details of his conversations with the president. “With all the speculation and all the smart people figuring out what was said and what wasn’t said, only two people know what was said,” he said. “That’s the president and me.” When Obama nominated Hagel in January 2013, he made clear that he was picking the former Nebraska senator to help wind down the war in Afghanistan, oversee a retrenchment in defense spending and ensure that troops who had served multiple tours in war zones were being taken care of. Although Hagel was a Republican, he and Obama had gotten along well in the Senate, where both had been critical of the Iraq war and pushed for a speedy end to the conflict. As a veteran of the Vietnam War, where he served as an enlisted soldier and was seriously wounded, Hagel spoke with authority about the human toll of combat and how the nation’s leaders should send troops into battle only as a last resort. Hagel still carries shrapnel in his chest from when he was nearly blown up by the Vietcong. During his time as defense secretary, he has occasionally referred to his time in the Army, but perhaps due to his Midwestern roots, he is usually modest and never dwells on the personal hardships he endured. On Thursday, however, he choked up briefly when he volunteered that it happened to be the 46th anniversary of the day when he returned from Vietnam to the United States, having survived a year of the war. “If anybody would have told Sergeant Hagel walking off that plane with my duffel bag where I’d be 46 years down the road, that would have been pretty hard for me to believe it,” he said, just before he ended the press conference. “I mean, the privileges I’ve had have just been tremendous.”"

The Washington Post,L,Jay Gruden could consider adding quarterbacks coach to staff next year - The Washington Post," By Mike Jones December 4 at 4:57 PM  Follow @mikejoneswapo      Quarterbacks Robert Griffin III, left, and Colt McCoy with offensive coordinator Sean McVay on Sunday. (Darron Cummings/Associated Press)  Redskins coach Jay Gruden said that he could consider adding a quarterbacks coach to his staff in the offseason. But the first-year head coach added that he doesn’t believe the lack of a coach with that title has hurt his passers this season. “Yeah, we are going to revisit everything next year, but that is a position we could revisit,” Gruden said when asked if he still felt good about his decision not to have a quarterback coach on his staff. When forming his coaching staff this season, Gruden tabbed Sean McVay as his offensive coordinator, Chris Foerster as offensive line coach, Randy Jordan has running backs coach, Ike Hilliard as wide receivers coach and Wes Phillips as tight ends coach. But Gruden didn’t hire a quarterbacks coach. He did, however, also hired an assistant offensive line coach, a “special projects” and an offensive quality control assistant. Gruden went without a quarterbacks coach, something that only the Redskins and Patriots have opted to do his season, largely because he is very hands-on with the offense, and the quarterbacks overall. The former quarterback also serves as his own play-caller, although McVay also has a role in the game planning, play selections and coaching of that unit. McVay helps run quarterbacks through position drills, handling the same tasks that Washington’s previous quarterbacks coach, Matt LaFleur, did the past four seasons. And offensive quality control assistant Jake Peetz also helps Gruden and McVay with some of the drilling of the quarterbacks.    Head coach Jay Gruden. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)  McVay and Gruden also share duties in running the quarterback meetings. Quarterback Robert Griffin III struggled this season and has been demoted to second string. Kirk Cousins had some bright spots as the starter with Griffin injured for five games earlier this season, but he played his way out of the job because of his inability to minimize turnovers. Colt McCoy has proven to be the most steady of the three quarterbacks. But Gruden said that he doesn’t see those struggles as a byproduct of not having an official quarterback coach. “I don’t regret it, no,” Gruden said about the decision. “Because I work closely with the quarterbacks also, and [McVay], and I figured I didn’t want to have too many voices preaching. But I think next year, if we have a spot on staff, there is a possibility we could add another guy to that area. But I think we have enough people in-house that are coaching the quarterbacks. That’s not an issue. But if we have a spot next year, then we can address it, like we will at every other position.” More from The Post: Haslett disappointed in secondary, but says issues are correctable Redskins brace for Rams pass rush | 2012 draft fixed neither team Jackson, five others remain out | Clark wants to finish strong Reid: For Gruden, the best place for Griffin is elsewhere More NFL:  Home page | Sports Bog | Early Lead | Fancy Stats | Fantasy Follow:  @MikeJonesWaPo | @lizclarketweet | @JReidPost | @Insider"

The Washington Post,L,Winona State gymnast Brooke Baures dies following accident in food-service elevator - The Washington Post," By Matt Bonesteel December 3  Follow @MattBonesteel   Brooke Baures, a member of the gymnastics team at Winona State University in Minnesota, died Monday following an accident at the restaurant at which she worked. [More details emerge about how the gymnast died] According to a report in the Winona Daily News, Baures was found dead Monday night in a food-service elevator at the WingDam Saloon & Grill in Fountain City, Wis., which is a short drive away from Winona State’s campus. The Buffalo County Sheriff’s Department received a 911 call shortly before 8 p.m. Monday from the WingDam Saloon & Grill, and when first responders arrived they discovered Baures’ body in the restaurant’s food service elevator, according to the Fountain City Police Department. Baures was an employee at the restaurant. Baures was pronounced dead at the scene, said Fountain City Police Chief Jason Mork. … Mork said the food elevator, commonly referred to as a dumbwaiter and located off the kitchen, runs between the first and second floors of the restaurant and is generally used to transport bulk food for parties and other events in the space. The opening to the elevator is about three feet by three feet, he said, and was not designed for employees to enter. The lifting mechanism works similar to an electric garage door, he said. Mork told KMSP-TV in Minneapolis that foul play was not believed to be involved. Reached for comment this afternoon, Jason Mork, the only cop in Fountain City (population 859), tells Fox 9, “I highly doubt [Baures] was using [the elevator] to move herself.” She was likely “using it to move food,” he adds. Pressed for more specifics, Mork says, “I won’t get into that… I would need to speculate.” Mork did say, however, that first responders found Baures “trapped inside the elevator… she was found by first responders to have passed away.” Winona State officials spoke highly of Baures, 21, who was a senior from Chetek, Wis. “Brooke had a magnetic personality and a smile that would light up the gym,” WSU gymnastics coach Beckie Rolbiecki told the Winona Daily News. “She was a sparkplug of a competitor and an ambitious, dedicated teammate. “She was one of those athletes who warmed your heart when you’d see her walk into the gym. It’s so hard for all of us to comprehend.”"
The Washington Post,L,"‘Star Wars, Episode VII’: Please, for the love of God, as little politics as possible - The Washington Post","  By Daniel W. Drezner December 4 at 9:39 AM Follow @dandrezner  Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at Tufts University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.      The thought of the next “Star Wars” film being an allegory of politics makes me as scared as actor John Boyega appears to be in this still from the teaser trailer to “Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens.’ (LucasFilm/Disney via Associated Press)  It’s entirely possible that I’ve watched this 20 or 30 times in the past week:  Like a lot of other “Star Wars” acolytes, the trailer was enlightening in that it proved that, despite his best efforts, George Lucas’s prequels could not extinguish my enthusiasm for events that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far way. The debut of the very cryptic trailer also has awakened a debate about whether this next trilogy will address political themes. My Washington Post colleague Alyssa Rosenberg began this debate with a post expressing a new hope that director J.J. Abrams will tackle some political questions head-on: By venturing to a galaxy far, far away, the original “Star Wars” movies managed to shake loose of the allusions to contemporary politics that shape so many fantasy and science fiction movies today. But if the most basic step in a hero’s journey — the decision to leave home – translated to a dusty little foreign planet of George Lucas’s imagining, the most basic question of politics – how to have a better life – can as well. And if J.J. Abrams wants to tell a story about the awakening of an old power and the victory of a new political movement over a sclerotic old system, it is an issue that ought to inform his story and his new characters. Of course, the political wonk empire strikes back, as always. Over at Bloomberg, Jonathan Bernstein sounds a cautionary note:  I’m not sure I agree about wanting more politics. Movies are almost always about individuals. Politics is often about institutions. That’s one reason Mr. Smithism – the idea that all it takes is for one honest person to stand up to corruption – is such a common way of portraying U.S. politics in the movies. It’s easier than explaining how institutions work, or how opposing interests can lead to conflict even though neither is inherently right or wrong.  And over at the Washington Monthly, Seth Masket weighs in as well, suggesting that political themes haunt the franchise like a phantom menace:   [J]ust because [inserting political themes into moves] can be done doesn’t mean it should be, particularly in a “Star Wars” film. Politics was never Lucas’ strength, and it’s not obvious from his previous work that J.J. Abrams has much interest in the subject. And that’s just fine. His 2009 “Star Trek” reboot had almost no politics in it at all and was one of the better sci-fi films of the last decade, faithful to the old franchise but still charting out new territory. “Into Darkness,” however, attempted to address some darker political motivations within the Federation, and it was a complete mess. There’s certainly the potential for some interesting political observations in Episode VII. At least some significant remnants of the Empire clearly remain, for example; I’m curious to know how they survived the Battle of Endor and what kind of control they exert within the galaxy. But I’d be totally fine with little or no explicit political references in the coming films. My fellow bloggers and I will intuit them anyway.  I fear that I have to side with my fellow political scientists here, although there is a middle ground that might be possible between Rosenberg’s hopes and Masket and Bernstein’s fears. The latter two are correct that past correlations are not encouraging: The “Star Wars” films that focused more on politics were easily the worst ones in the franchise, and J.J. Abrams has a very poor track record when he concentrates on anything other than lens flares action-packed space opera. Furthermore, a real problem with Lucas’s prequels is that their narrative arc didn’t really leave this galaxy. “Revenge of the Sith” was so easily viewed as an allegory for the Bush administration’s exploitation of the war on terrorism that the number of similar commentaries on the subject made it seem like an attack of the clones. That said, only a vengeful Sith deals in absolutes, so maybe Rosenberg’s hopes should not be dismissed entirely. To expand on her point, the one thing that both the original trilogy and the prequels have in common is the central narrative. In both trilogies, an obscure, powerless individual on an impoverished planet is suddenly thrust into the most important and pivotal political struggles of the galaxy. In their journeys, both Luke and Anakin are tempted by the Dark Side of power, and their ultimate choices lead to very different outcomes. If John Boyega’s character represents that particular narrative arc, there are ways in which this next trilogy can address politics without getting bogged down in them. That’s a big “if,” however, for two reasons. First, I’m worried about what the political landscape of this galaxy will look like 30 years after the return of the Jedi. The politics of the original trilogy were simple and gripping: a rebel movement opposing a totalitarian dictatorship. The politics of the prequels were more complex — at the expense of things like, you know, characterization. The new trailer suggests that the Imperial forces have not exactly disappeared, which means that the politics here probably will be about a Rebel Alliance facing growth pains as it tries to actually govern. Although the political scientist in me is intrigued by that narrative possibility , the sci-fi geek in me is petrified that these questions will bore the hell out of me while I’m watching — or, worse, enrage me, like Anakin Skywalker’s political pontificating. And we all know what happens when fear and anger enter into the political equation. Second, the stone-cold truth about Lucas’s “Star Wars” universe is that the politics of it are inherently elitist. The whole concept of the Jedi embraces an elitist, cartelistic view of power. Because the Force is awakening in this next movie, the Jedi will still be an ongoing political project in these films. And I’m wary that they can be used to discuss any grand political themes that resonate in our own galaxy. So I hope that Rosenberg’s aspirations are fulfilled — but I fear that our destiny as movie-watchers probably lies with Bernstein and Masket. What do you think?"
The Washington Post,L,More protests underway in D.C. on Thursday - The Washington Post," By Julie Zauzmer December 4 at 8:00 PM  Follow @JulieZauzmer   Protests calling for changes to law enforcement protocols, after the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and others, continued in downtown Washington on Thursday evening.    Protesters march in D.C. on Thursday evening. (Sarah L. Voisin/Washington Post)  Demonstrators standing on the 14th Street Bridge temporarily closed all northbound lanes during the evening rush hour. At about 6:50 p.m., police said that the protesters had left the bridge and were marching west on Constitution Ave., causing street closures as they moved. Starting at 4 p.m., the protesters gathered in front of the Justice Department and began a march that took them near the National  Christmas Tree lighting at the Ellipse — where revelers reportedly could hear the chants of the demonstrators.    Protesters march in D.C. on Thursday evening. (Sarah L. Voisin/Washington Post)  A second march, organized by the National Black United Front, started at D.C. police headquarters at 300 Indiana Ave. NW at 7 p.m. The protesters, more than 200 of whom crowded on the steps in front of police headquarters, said they planned to march to the Wilson Building. Joe Donovan, who is white, said the rally was his third in a week and a half. “I felt a lot of emotions, a lot of anger and confusion,” said Donovan, 24, about hearing that a New York grand jury had decided not to indict the officer who held Garner in a chokehold, killing him. “Now I’m just trying to see what I can fit in. It’s not my struggle, but I’m trying to do what I can.” Washington has been the scene of marches and demonstrations — organized by a fragmented set of activist groups and advertised mainly by social media — almost every day since a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson for shooting Brown, an unarmed black teenager in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. Miles Parks contributed to this report."

The Washington Post,L,The glaring problem with #CrimingWhileWhite - The Washington Post," By Caitlin Dewey December 4 at 2:37 PM  Follow @caitlindewey      (Twitter)  #CrimingWhileWhite, the explosive Twitter hashtag that trended worldwide Thursday morning and racked up more than 300,000 tweets since Wednesday night, is a well-intentioned attempt to expose the different ways whites and people of color are treated by police. It is also an enduring testament to an unavoidable fact: White people can make absolutely anything about them. The ostensible purpose of the hashtag, per its creator, “Tonight Show” writer Jason Ross, is to document racial injustice in policing … from the perspective of white people. As such, the hashtag consists mostly of Twitter users “confessing” to minor crimes for which they were never charged. It’s a head-shaking list, particularly following the deaths of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Here are people shoplifting, driving drunk, swearing at police — and always getting away with it, because they “look nice.” I shoplifted when I was 14 and they let me go because my parents came down and we ″looked like a nice family.” #crimingwhilewhite— Joel Watson (@hijinksensue) December 4, 2014  Got pulled over while driving 115MPH, only got a $80 tickt instead of a felony 4 being cooperative n wearing my seatbelt #CrimingWhileWhite— eli skipp (@skipp) December 4, 2014  At 13 I stole a car with my friends & drove it 2wks before we got busted. Only one charged was black. #CrimingWhileWhite— Cecily Kellogg (@Cecilyk) December 4, 2014  It’s really important to note these inequities, of course. It’s critical that we record and analyze and criticize white privilege, that oft-confounding, abstract concept that describes the pack of unearned advantages you get in life, just by virtue of your race. But there’s profound privilege built into even #CrimingWhileWhite, which is supposedly such a force against it. Consider how fortunate and secure you must be, to feel entitled to talk about yourself in the face of someone else’s overwhelming pain and grief. To be comfortable flinging around light-hearted anecdotes about the police, because those interactions don’t represent any kind of ongoing threat to you or your family. To type 100 characters and stamp them with a trendy hashtag, unafraid of any blowback — because, as per usual, you rule the narrative; yours is the dominant voice. To top it all off, #CrimingWhileWhite has earned fawning, uncritical write-ups on virtually every news site out there, a scale and tone of coverage we rarely see for #BlackLivesMatter or #DyingWhileBlack or any other non-white social media narrative on race. “#CrimingWhileWhite is the only thing you need to read to understand white privilege,” Think Progress proclaimed. But #CrimingWhileWhite doesn’t just document white privilege — it is white privilege, manifest. Don’t get me wrong: I’m sure these tweeters truly do mean well. I’m sure they are genuinely outraged by the police’s treatment of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and other black men killed by white police under polarizing circumstances. But there are subtle shades of difference between being outraged by something — a sort of luxurious, twice-removed feeling — and actually living that something, yourself. That doesn’t mean that you, as a white person, are not allowed to discuss what just happened in New York and Ferguson, and it doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to talk about issues of race in this country. It just means that — maybe this once! – don’t talk about yourself. Several hours after #CrimingWhileWhite began to trend, the writer Jamilah Lemieux started a competing hashtag: It’s called #AliveWhileBlack, and it’s meant to document white privilege, in the justice system and elsewhere, from the perspective of people of color. As of this writing, it’s earned only a sixth of the tweets that #CrimingWhileWhite did. I was stopped 29 times by cops in E. Europe during my 18 months as a Fulbright Scholar. Police racism is a world issue. #alivewhileblack— Terrell J. Starr (@Russian_Starr) December 4, 2014  Cops were called the day I moved into my new apartment in the Castro, waited for my new roommate to get there #alivewhileblack— Mark S. Luckie ☜ (@marksluckie) December 4, 2014  Walking to library. Campus security stops me and asks for ID. Several times. Claims I don’t ″look” like a law student. #AliveWhileBlack— GrooveSDC (@GrooveSDC) December 4, 2014  Went to police station to report that a white man had sexually assaulted me. Was lectured about how I could ruin his life. #AliveWhileBlack— Akilah Hughes (@AkilahObviously) December 4, 2014  white student’s dad refused to let me in my own dorm b/c he didn’t believe i attended #GWU. ″you can’t come in!” he yelled #alivewhileblack— eBae (@audacityofDOPE_) December 4, 2014  … That’s our loss, honestly. Because those tweets say more about white privilege than white people ever could."
The Washington Post,L,U.S. contractor has spent five years in a Cuban prison for distributing Internet equipment - The Washington Post," By Nancy Scola December 4 at 1:41 PM  Follow @nancyscola      Five years to the day after his arrest in Cuba on espionage charges, former U.S. contractor Alan Gross, shown in a file photo with his wife, Judy, is threatening a hunger strike, refusing almost all visitors and predicting he will die in prison if he isn’t freed by his 66th birthday in May, relatives and backers said Wednesday. (AP Photo/Courtesy Gross family, File)  The Obama White House has once again called for Cuba to release 65-year-old Alan Gross, a U.S. citizen who is being described in widely-distributed press reports as an ""American government contractor."" But on the fifth anniversary of Gross's imprisonment on a 15-year sentence, it's worth remembering the nature of the crimes against Cuba's ""independence or territorial integrity” with which Gross has been charged. Gross, working with the U.S. Agency for International Development, distributed equipment intended to get Jewish Cubans online, including laptops, Wi-Fi routers and satellite phones. Those devices look to Cuban authorities to be the tools of subversion. (They look that way to other governments, too, as the new Freedom House report on the state of online freedoms in 2014 makes plain.) The Internet is a particularly fraught question for the Cuban government, which has long believed that it is part of the country's technological sovereignty to limit how Cubans go online. On Wednesday, the White House said in a statement: Five years ago today Alan Gross was arrested for his efforts to help ordinary Cuban citizens have greater access to information through the Internet.  The Administration remains focused on securing Alan's freedom from a Cuban prison, and returning him safely to his wife and children, where he belongs. We remain deeply concerned for Alan's health, and reiterate our call for his release.  The Cuban Government's release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba. Gross, in should be noted, was in Cuba as part of a controversial pro-democracy program, and he represented himself not as a U.S. government contractor but as being in Cuba to do philanthropic work. But any discussion of Gross's imprisonment is incomplete without a recognition that he wasn't in Cuba distributing guns or tank parts. He was passing out equipmentso that people could get online, which is something that the Cuban government considers quite dangerous enough."
The Washington Post,L,"Does Rahm Emanuel miss D.C.? Pardon his French, but no. - The Washington Post"," By Katie Zezima December 4 at 5:43 PM  Follow @katiezez      This guy doesn't like D.C. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File)  Rahm Emanuel, current mayor of Chicago, former congressman and White House chief of staff and forever profanity maven, has some choice words about Washington. And we can't print most of them. Emanuel visited the White House Thursday. Suffice it to say, he does not miss 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. A reporter for CQ Roll Call spotted Emanuel after he cleared security there. Does Emanuel miss the White House? ""No f-ing way,"" he responded. And responded again, exactly the same way, when asked about Congress. So if he hates Washington so much why was he back? ""Money,"" he said. And thus departed Rahm Emanuel, a man of few words -- and fewer printable ones.   "
The Washington Post,L,"What percentage of politicians support same-sex marriage, by state - The Washington Post"," By Hunter Schwarz December 4 at 5:33 PM  Follow @hunterschwarz    About 45 percent of all governors and members of Congress across the country support same-sex marriage, and in all but 10 states there is at least one member of Congress or the governor who does. The percentage of politicians who support marriage for same-sex couples is slightly lower than the percentage of Americans who do. A September Pew poll found that 49 percent of respondents were in favor of gay men and lesbians being allowed to legally marry, while 41 percent were opposed and 10 percent didn’t know. Using information from the Human Rights Campaign and governors’ public statements, the percentage of elected officials who support marriage for same-sex couples was mapped out. Vacant seats were not included in states’ total, and elected officials whose views on marriage were not clear were not counted as being supportive. In Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont, 100 percent of governors and members of Congress support marriage for same-sex couples. In Maryland, there is more than 90 percent support, and in Maine, New Hampshire and New York, there is at least 80 percent support."
The Washington Post,L,I refuse to post a single picture of my baby on Facebook - The Washington Post,"  By Emily Kaye Lazzaro December 4 at 12:17 PM Follow EmilyKayeLa  Emily Kaye Lazzaro is a writer, actor, and playwright based in Somerville, Massachusetts.      iStock  In my Facebook newsfeed, it’s common for brand-new parents to post pictures of their babies as a modern-day birth announcement. I love these posts. I love getting updates on how the baby and mother are doing, and I love cute pictures because I am a human being with a beating heart in my chest. But bad news for my Facebook friends: I won’t be posting pictures of my baby on Facebook. There are pros and cons to this policy. Pro: The smugness of privacy It always felt to me that people who really value their privacy are very important and also have a huge amount of self-control. Like the really cool celebrities. Or people who don’t even have Facebook. Oh man, I wish I could be one of those people. Instead, I periodically pretend like I don’t have Facebook, feel like a million bucks for a week, then cave like that scene in “Flight” and binge on my newsfeed for a few hours. I am not important, and I constantly overshare. I have almost posted baby pictures a few times, but the thing that stopped me, more than my husband’s insistence and my own fear of his image being misappropriated, is the delicious smugness I feel. I think Buster said it best:  She gets off on being withholding. Con: What’s the use of feeling smug if people don’t even know how cute he is?  Beyoncé probably feels great about people not seeing pictures of Blue Ivy because everybody knows about Blue Ivy. If nobody knows about my baby, there’s no way for them to be impressed that I haven’t posted pictures of him. This reminds me of when I started college. I sent a lot of e-mails to my close high school friends, detailing all the new friends I was making and experiences I was having. I was obsessive about communicating the minutiae of my college experience because I felt like if my old friends didn’t know about it, it didn’t happen. Now this is true on a much larger scale. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to Instagram it, did it really happen? I also feel this way about sunsets and times when my dog and cat snuggle and things I bake. Of course sunsets and animal snuggles and baked goods exist, but all of those things, like this time in my baby’s life, are ephemeral. Isn’t this why we’ve been photographing things since the camera was invented? To hold on to moments even as they slip through our fingers? That’s a bit of a reach. Maybe it’s just that I want to share the nice moments with my network because there are so many not nice moments, especially in parenthood. Or maybe it’s because I’m super self-involved and my baby is just an extension of myself. Who knows! Pro: Nobody from the Internet will appropriate pictures of my precious infant to make me look like an idiot. This is a real and personal issue for me, as I made the grievous error of being a blogger and writing about pregnancy and money. Turns out, many people don’t like what I have to say. And some have decided to illustrate their distaste by stealing pictures of me and writing not so nice things. In fact, a tabloid found a piece I’d written and decided to write something about me. To illustrate it, they used Facebook pictures of me, my husband, and my dog (taken from my husband’s account). I was wearing a silly hat in one of them. In another, I’m grimacing and petting my dog’s belly. Using images of me and my husband is bad enough, but my beagle? That is especially low. She already has emotional problems, she doesn’t need this on top of it. Now, granted, my husband’s Facebook privacy settings were pretty weak, and we’ve remedied that since, but the whole situation spooked me good. So, not posting pictures of my baby on Facebook means no Internet strangers can use his image against me. This is the world we live in. Con: It is less easy for people to see how cute my baby is. He is very cute! But nobody knows. Refusing to post pictures of him on the Internet means I am forgoing the dozens of likes and comments and accompanying surges of validation and satisfaction that I have come to expect with major life moments. It’s not even that my close friends can’t see him, I still allow myself to text pictures to close friends and family. It’s the peripheral acquaintances, the people I went to high school with, guys I had crushes on in college. They are my real concern. They will never see how cute my baby is, and thus will never know how great I’m doing and how happy I am. Can I live with that? This, of course, touches on the issue of cultivating our online personas, only revealing the good and hiding the everyday struggles. But whatever, when other people post smiley baby pictures it makes me want to post them too. Forget about the fact that I am still 35 pounds overweight, that’s not part of my image. My personal brand does not include the revelation I had last night that the biggest challenge of new parenthood is not murdering your own baby when he won’t stop crying. Facebook is for happy times. Cute outfits and first smiles and those chubby arms with the rubber-band wrists. If I don’t post cute pictures of my baby on Facebook, that means I have to rely on myself to be impressive. I have to look good and accomplish things in my career and that is hard. At the very least, I have to make jokes in my status updates, without accompanying photographs. As if I don’t have enough going on. Pro: There are other ways The night my son was born, my husband, in a terrified, sleep-deprived haze, spent hours looking for an app we could use to share baby pictures with family and friends. We use 23snaps; it doesn’t let other users copy your pictures or use them on other platforms. And it almost feels like we have freed ourselves from the shackles of Facebook, at least a tiny bit. And it feels less like we are forcing baby pictures down people’s throats and more like we’re sharing with people who actually give a crap, which is nice. Look, I’m certainly not saying this is how every new parent should behave. I’m not even sure how long I’ll last. If it makes you happy, post pictures of your kids wherever you damn well please. This is America. But I will say one thing. Two days ago, we took our seven-week-old son to the beach for the first time. We let our dog off her leash and my husband carried the baby snug on his chest. We smelled the ocean and felt the sand under our shoes and we forgot to take pictures, which initially sent me into a small panic. My baby’s first time at the beach and there is no record of it! Was it reckless of me to not have documented this fleeting bliss? But maybe part of being a parent and the growing up that comes with that will be the ability to just enjoy a moment of peace and happiness with my family, even if the Internet doesn’t know about it. "
The Washington Post,L,We’ve reached a tipping point when Charles Krauthammer is more outspoken on police abuses than Barack Obama - The Washington Post," By Emily Badger December 4 at 10:51 AM  Follow @emilymbadger      Protestors shout at Times Square after it was announced that the New York City police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner is not being indicted, Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2014, in New York. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)  It's a common condolence for politicians to urge angry communities to ""have their voices heard"" in response to signs of systemic injustice. Barack Obama has used the phrase since Ferguson. So has Eric Holder, and even St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch, the night he announced that a grand jury would not indict the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown. The idea, of course, is that a voice is a potent tool for creating change, particularly for people who possess little other power. But the more accurate reality is that change starts to feel imminent not when the likely voices grow louder, but when the unlikely ones start to speak up. This is why it's a big deal — if an awkward commentary on whose words matter most — that conservatives seem appalled, too, by Wednesday's news that a New York Police Department officer won't be indicted in the death of Eric Garner. Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said this on MSNBC in response to the latest grand jury announcement: ""They tell us, at least, a prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich. Well clearly a black man's life is not worth a ham sandwich when you put these stories together.""  Here is Senator Rand Paul, a potential Republican presidential candidate, saying that it's hard to watch the video of Garner's death and ""not be horrified by it"":  And here is conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, on Fox News, calling the latest grand jury decision ""totally incomprehensible"":  Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com For reasons that Aaron Blake points out over at The Fix, the politics around Eric Garner's death have been different from those around Michael Brown's. In the New York case, caught on tape, there are fewer details to dispute, leaving bare some painful points of consensus: An unarmed black man died after an NYPD officer apparently wrapped an arm around his neck, deploying a tactic banned by his department. The man's alleged crime was selling illegal cigarettes. He repeatedly cried that he couldn't breathe as he was dying. That this story has drawn bipartisan condemnation is what makes it feel like a tipping point. The fact that Michael Steele has been more blunt than Barack Obama thus far makes it seem as if liberals and conservatives are finally watching the same event, staring down the same problem, not opposing versions of it. This isn't to say that the voices of protesters aren't meaningful, too. But protest is largely the expression of people who knew that police bias and excessive force were problems before Michael Brown and Eric Garner died. When partisans who haven't said much about these issues before start to speak up, too, that's a sign that a larger swathe of America may be waking up to that reality, too."
The Washington Post,L,"Despite beheadings, Americans are still overwhelmingly against paying ransoms to terrorists - The Washington Post"," By Adam Taylor December 4 at 10:57 AM  Follow @mradamtaylor        Al-Qaeda’s affiliate in the Arabian Peninsula threatened to kill Luke Somers, an American photojournalist, after U.S. commandos attempted to free him. (Reuters)   After the killing of three U.S. citizens by the militant group Islamic State this year, there has been a renewed debate in the United States about the logic of not paying ransoms to terrorists — although many other nations do pay up covertly. That debate may well come into focus again this week, after al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula — the terror network's affiliate in Yemen — threatened to kill Luke Somers, an American kidnapped in Yemen, in a video released Wednesday. In the past, the United States has used moral and tactical arguments to defend its policy, arguing that paying ransoms not only emboldens hostage-takers, but also helps finance terrorism. But there's also a political factor for the U.S. government to keep in mind: According to polls, the U.S. public is overwhelmingly against paying ransoms to international terrorists who take Americans hostage. One recent survey conducted by Quinnipiac University found that just 21 percent of Americans were in favor of paying ransoms to terrorists in some circumstances, while 70 percent felt there were no circumstances in which paying ransoms was acceptable. Ten percent of respondents said they didn't know how they felt. The opposition to paying ransoms can be found among all demographics for which Quinnipiac University provides details. Politically, Democrats were less likely than Republicans to be against paying ransoms, though a majority (56 percent) said that the United States should never pay (31 percent said there were some circumstances under which ransoms should be paid). Among Republicans, those figures were 80 percent against and 13 percent in favor. Both men and women were against paying ransoms, though women were less so (61 percent of women and 81 percent of men). Those from military households fit into the broader trend, with 77 percent against paying and 16 percent finding it acceptable in some circumstances. The only group that seems open to paying ransoms are young adults. Forty-one percent of people ages 18-29 say there are some circumstances in which ransoms should be paid, not that far off the number opposing it (46 percent). It's possible that this reflects a changing attitude to ransoms — many older respondents may have had their opinions formed by hostage crises in the 20th century, for example. The finding also may simply reflect the younger generation's tendency to lean Democratic.      The White House admitted on Thursday that a hostage rescue mission last month in Yemen failed to liberate American Luke Somers because he was not present at the targeted location. (AP)   The Quinnipiac poll was conducted between Nov. 18 and 23, meaning that respondents had had time to think about ransoms after the deaths of James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Abdul-Rahman Kassig (video of Kassig's death was released Nov. 16). This is despite the fact that a variety of prisoners of other nationalities were released by the Islamic State, apparently after the extremist organization received payments — one U.N. expert estimates that the group has received up to $45 million in ransoms. Comparative polling has shown that Europeans are more open to paying ransoms, though they are still generally opposed. The U.S. response fits into a broader history of public opposition to negotiating with terrorists: A September New York Times/CBS poll found that 53 percent of Americans felt that the U.S. government should never negotiate with terrorists in any circumstances, while just 38 percent said they should. Information specific to ransoms is harder to find, but what little there is in polling archives suggests that Americans have been against paying ransoms for a long time. A 1989 Associated Press/Media General poll found 85 percent opposed to the United States paying money to free American hostages being held in Lebanon. In 1980, 76 percent of respondents in a ABC News/Harris poll opposed raising $5 million to free hostages being held in Iran. And way back in 1938, a Gallup poll showed 67 percent of Americans felt it should be against the law for a family to pay ransom to a kidnapper, while 33 percent said no.

The Washington Post,L,Huge shakeup at The New Republic: What does this vanity publisher want? - The Washington Post," By Erik Wemple December 4 at 6:46 PM  Follow @ErikWemple      Sean Eldridge, president, Hudson River Ventures, and Chris Hughes, editor in chief and publisher of The New Republic and a founder of Facebook, attend the Paris Review Spring Revel in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, April 3, 2012. The benefit celebrated the literary magazine’s 200th issue. (Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg)  There was a telling moment at the New Republic’s centennial celebration last month in the stately Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium. New CEO Guy Vidra, recently appointed by owner (and Facebook co-founder) Chris Hughes, took the podium to discuss the magazine’s challenges and opportunities in a digital age, just as any modern-day media mogul would do. When he referenced the name of The New Republic’s top editor, however, he mispronounced it: “Frank FOY-er,” he said. “That’s indicative of his familiarity and interest in Frank’s impact on the magazine, on the website,” says a TNR editorial staffer familiar with the disconnect between the magazine’s new leadership and Foer himself, who has served as editor since 2012, his second stint in the position. This afternoon, a shower of memos sprung from New Republic e-mail accounts, announcing a significant shakeup, as first reported by Politico’s Dylan Byers: Foer was out as editor-in-chief, to be replaced by Gabriel Snyder of Bloomberg Media, and formerly editor of Atlantic Wire and Gawker. In his memo, Vidra wrote of his new top editor, “He is committed – as am I – to The New Republic’s mission of impact, influence and persuasion, but understands that fulfilling that mission in today’s media landscape requires new forms,” reads the memo. “He truly reflects the ‘straddle generation’ of journalists and editors who remain deeply rooted in the qualities of traditional journalism – having worked with brands such as the New York Observer and The Atlantic – but also understands what it takes to create content that will travel across all platforms. We believe he is the right person to help us to maintain the core DNA of The New Republic, while propelling us forward to the 21st century.” In that same missive, Vidra announced that the frequency of the New Republic’s print edition would drop from 20 to 10 issues a year. In conjunction with the print reduction, Vidra promises something chilling: “[W]e will also be making some changes to staff structure. This is not a decision we make lightly, but we believe this restructuring is critical to the long-term success of the company.” Are layoffs coming? Nobody knows. According to one internal source, there was chatter in the office of a mass departure, in large part because the staff was loyal to Foer. “Everyone loves Frank,” says the internal source. Staffers say that Foer found out about his ouster not from Hughes and Vidra but rather through the grapevine, as word of Snyder’s hiring seeped into his socio-professional network. More big news in the memo: The New Republic’s New York arm is moving to “a newly re-designed, expanded office in New York’s Union Square. New York was the original home of The New Republic, and we’re thrilled to further expand our presence here.” (The D.C. office will remain put). And in case you haven’t heard, famed literary editor Leon Wieseltier is out in the purge. A newish, tech-oriented New Republic in a sleek New York office won’t surprise staffers who’ve interacted with Vidra, a former general manager of Yahoo News and former head of business development at The Washington Post, since his announcement as the New Republic’s CEO in September. According to an informed source, Vidra introduced himself to the staff in a meeting where he spoke grandly of the digital imperatives of the magazine. What was absent from the session was any nod to the work of Foer. “There was no deference to Frank,” says a source. Vidra’s insertion comes after some strategic shifting at the New Republic. In 2012, multimillionaire Hughes bought a majority stake in the magazine and determinedly set out to pound Washington with its relevance. He doubled the editorial staff of 15; he hired Foer; he opened a New York office; and he talked big: “I want everyone from Michael Bloomberg to Zadie Smith to Sheryl Sandberg to read The New Republic,” he told the New York Times. Though Hughes had come from the world of technology, his magazine’s initial strategy came from the world of media. The staff build-out created separate and unequal fiefdoms of youngsters who toiled away primarily on NewRepublic.com and more experienced writers who did good, big pieces for the print edition (and which also did well on NewRepublic.com). The websters didn’t stick around: Lydia DePillis left the New Republic for the Washington Post’s Wonkblog; Noreen Malone left for New York Magazine; Molly Redden left for Mother Jones; Marc Tracy eventually left for the New York Times. According to three sources, the Hughes regime realized in mid-2013 that it couldn’t sustain a great print magazine and a great web project at the same time. Its efforts to boost print subscriptions weren’t producing the dividends it needed, nor was it pulling in enough print advertising. So it started to pivot toward a more web-trafficky approach. For this tack, it grabbed the prolific Brian Beutler from Salon.com as well as Danny Vinik and Rebecca Leber, from ThinkProgress. As part of the turn towards webbiness, the New Republic started imitating others last June, launching QED, a boutique-y version of Wonkblog-Vox.com, FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot — you know, smart people explaining stuff with a bit of opinion thrown in. The push toward a digital emphasis hit a new level with Vidra’s hiring. In a recent New York Times interview, Vidra touted a focus on storytelling approaches that “travel well” on the Internet. Seeking a bit more explanation on that topic, the Erik Wemple Blog last month received this explanation from Vidra: Our aim is to find forms of storytelling that resonate with online audiences, not just to drive traffic, but to have readers engage deeply with The New Republic. Our long form journalism is one form of storytelling that readers consistently flock to. Pieces that challenge, provoke, and elevate the discourse perform extremely well online. For example, William Deresiewicz’s cover story on the Ivy League (our most read story of all time), Noam Scheiber’s cover story on Valerie Jarrett, and Franklin Foer’s cover story on Amazon are some of our most read articles this past month. A very relevant example of extending our storytelling into new formats that travel well online is our 100 Thinkers project. We brought 100 Thinkers to life on the web earlier this week after having our developers, designers and writers work collaboratively from ideation to execution. The results have been very positive with readers engaging deeply, spending a significant amount of time navigating through the microsite and sharing it broadly on Facebook and Twitter. While not a 5,000 word essay, it challenges our readers’ assumptions about the world and we’ll continue to experiment with storytelling forms like this. Those are telling words, in hindsight. For one, Vidra cites as aspirational the work of a guy whose firing he just effected (Foer’s Amazon piece, that is). And for another, he lauds Scheiber’s excellent piece on Jarrett, titled “The Obama Whisperer: No one has understood Valerie Jarrett’s role, until now.” Had he cared to include other examples of that New Republic genre, he might have cited Alec MacGillis’s stunning September 2013 investigation of Bill Clinton aide Doug Band; MacGillis’s in-depth profile of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Jonathan Cohn’s investigation into “the barely regulated, unsafe business of looking after our children“; and a whole lot of Julia Ioffe reporting on Russia. Those, and others like them, are the hallmarks of Foer’s second go-round at the New Republic. At the centennial gala, Foer and others, including Wieseltier, waxed grandiose about the New Republic’s history as a journal of ideas, of great debates, of concepts and “blah blah blah.” The celebration, the costs of which the New Republic wouldn’t divulge, offered as party gifts a large tome of great New Republic essays going back to its beginnings. The Erik Wemple Blog spent Thanksgiving break with the book and enjoyed the thinking of Walter Lippmann, Margaret Talbot, Wieseltier and many others. Indeed, the featured works align with the notion of an idea-centric New Republic. Yet Foer in recent years has tacked away from pure thinkiness with his idea-investigative pieces — pieces that have clothed the publication in recent glory. The Jarrett piece, for instance, hopped all around social media, leaving the Erik Wemple Blog absolutely no choice but to open it up. Similar surges of interest around other deeply reported stuff had to delight Hughes. Wasn’t this precisely the stuff that a status-conscious vanity publisher wanted to generate? Yes, says one staffer: “He was totally into it. He was basking in the prestige he was getting from it. This is why it seemed like things were going to be fine.” Now there’s concern that under this staff restructuring and continuing web pivot, such stories won’t be coming out too often: “It’s mystifying that he’s doing something that’s about to make him look deeply unserious,” says the staffer. Perhaps Vidra and Snyder can thread “straddling” operation. We’ll have to wait and see. As they go about their business, they’ll be doing it without the guidance of Wieseltier, who by his own admission isn’t the most webby guy: Leon says he doesn’t do Twitter but he loves you all. — Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe) December 4, 2014  Whether you call him the magazine’s conscience, its guiding light, its curmudgeon or much, much worse, one thing is clear: Wieseltier has been a constant at the New Republic, having served as literary editor since 1983. Upon Hughes’s accession as publisher, Wieseltier struck a tone of conciliation, sounding very hopeful of holding on to his longtime perch: “He has no interest in blogging, which, I have to say, sounded like Mozart to me,” said Wieseltier of Hughes to the New Yorker back in 2012. “In acquiring a new owner, the thing you worry about, it’s the continuities and the discontinuities—what will be continuous and what will be discontinuous. It’s pretty clear that the continuities here are going to be the essential ones. I’m really confident that that includes our politics.” Those continuities held on Wieseltier on staff for a couple of years. Despite all the chatter about web vs. print and “thinky” vs. investigative, his departure is the big story here. After all, regular old editors commonly get tossed from their New Republic offices, while Wieseltier kept on writing, thinking, lecturing. And then a tech upstart booted a Washington institution."
The Washington Post,L,Black males and the cops who kill them - The Washington Post," By Jonathan Capehart December 4 at 6:02 PM  Follow @capehartj      Demonstrators walk together during a protest Dec. 3, 2014 in New York. Protests began after a Grand Jury decided to not indict officer Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner. (Yana Paskova/Getty Images)  Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Michael Brown have something in common: All were unarmed African American males killed by police officers. Now, we are learning that the cops who killed them have something in common. Either they or the department they worked for had serious problems. That these men were still given a gun and badge and were in a position to take the life of a black male without being held accountable is what’s rubbing the nerves raw of African Americans, all Americans. Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner with a chokehold caught on video last July. The death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner. The grand jury opted not to indict him. The Daily News and the Staten Island Advance have reported on two lawsuits involving Pantaleo and racially motivated conduct. A 2012 suit involved two black men who alleged their testicles were “tapped” during an out-in-the-open strip search. According to the Daily News, the allegations were “deemed unsubstantiated — it could not be proven or disproven….” Each accuser got $15,000 when the case was settled out of court. The charges against them were dropped. Another suit against Pantaleo is still pending. According to a July 20 story in The Advance, Rylawn Walker “accuses Pantaleo of arresting him on Feb. 16, 2012 even though he was ‘committing no crime at that time and was not acting in a suspicious manner.’”    Undated photo of Tamir Rice provided by his family’s attorney. (Courtesy of Richardson & Kucharski Co. L.P.A./AP)  Timothy A. Loehmann is the Cleveland police officer who killed Rice in a Cleveland park on Nov. 22. The video shows that the police cruiser had barely stopped and Loehmann was barely out of the car before he shot Tamir dead. Now comes word that Loehmann resigned from his last police job because his supervisor recommended he dismissed because, “I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct the deficiencies.” Issues with a girlfriend were part of the problem. According to NBC News, the deputy chief “cited a report from a firearms instructor who said Loehmann showed up for training ‘distracted,’ ‘weepy’ and unable to ‘communicate clear thoughts,’ as a result of which ‘his handgun performance was dismal.’” Oh, the irony. And then there is Darren Wilson, the unindicted killer of Brown. As The Post reported last August, in his job before joining the Ferguson, Mo., police force, “Wilson kept a clean record without any disciplinary action.” But that force in Jennings, Mo., was so bad the city council disbanded it in 2011. Jennings is 89 percent African American. A city council member told The Post that there were “one or two black members on the force” of 45 employees. Wilson was among the officers let go. “What [Wilson] found in Jennings…was a mainly white department mired in controversy and notorious for its fraught relationship with residents, especially the African American majority,” The Post story notes. “It was not an ideal place to learn.” Perhaps this informed the guilt-by-association mindset he revealed at the grand jury looking into his killing of Brown. “It’s really bad when I’m overseas and more worried about your safety,” a white American friend who is working in the Middle East wrote in an instant message this morning. Then, in one line, he articulated what African Americans have known for a long time: “Cops have more influence over the administration of your constitutional rights than any judge or elected official… [not to mention] your life.” The only bright side to the horror of the past seven days is that more and more white people see that “black lives matter.” Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj"
The Washington Post,L,"After Brown and Garner, limiting the downside of police body cameras - The Washington Post"," By Stephen Stromberg December 4 at 8:04 PM Follow @strombergsteve      A New York City police officer wears a body camera during a news conference about a pilot program. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)  It’s inevitable that more police officers will be wearing body cameras in the coming years. The question should be, under what standards? After a grand jury declined to indict New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo for putting Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold, despite shocking footage of the incident, some have questioned whether more video evidence will matter much. Meanwhile, the Atlantic’s Uri Friedman pushed back Wednesday against the strong post-Ferguson movement to deploy officer body cameras, noting that experts still lack definitive proof that they live up to their hype as policing tools. They make “logical sense,” body camera expert Barak Ariel told Friedman — but researchers are still collecting evidence. That’s not to say, though, that there isn’t any. There are several strong indications that body cameras can improve a range of law enforcement activities, including confrontations that have the potential to turn violent. One sign is the success of police dashboard cameras, which have “increased officer safety and accountability and reduced agency liability,” a recent Justice Department analysis reported. Another is psychological research that shows people tend to be more responsible when they are being recorded. Yet another is on-the-ground experience from early-adopting police departments in the United States and Britain. The Justice report warns that it’s not yet clear why body cameras seem to help. “The decline in complaints and use of force may be tied to improved citizen behavior, improved police officer behavior, or a combination of the two. It may also be due to changes in citizen complaint reporting patterns (rather than a civilizing effect), as there is evidence that citizens are less likely to file frivolous complaints against officers wearing cameras.” But any of these causal explanations would be positive. These considerations and logical sense seem to be enough for policymakers. President Obama has asked Congress for $263 million in federal funds to help equip police departments. That would accelerate a transition that has already begun. If the question of whether the country will put body cameras on more officers already seems to be answered, however, there are still plenty more questions that police departments will have to address from there. For example: Where will they store their recorded video? Will officers be trained well enough to know when it’s appropriate to record and when it’s not — and reliably act on that knowledge? Will public disclosure practices be geared toward effective transparency, witness protection and other worthy goals, or toward shielding officers? And how will police departments ensure that stored, unreleased video — on the cloud, say — is protected from unauthorized access? Homeland security consultant Paul Rosenzweig put it to me this way: If you’re wondering whether storing sensitive police images in the cloud is a potential privacy hazard, “ask Jennifer Lawrence.” “Officers a lot of times are seeing people on the worst day of their lives,” an Albuquerque police sergeant told Justice Department analysts, “and we’re capturing that on video that’s now a public record.” Police departments will have to figure out how various privacy and evidence laws apply to body camera footage. They will also have to fill in gaps. The Body Worn Video Steering Group, an international association of police organizations using body cameras, has developed a policy template that departments can adapt for themselves. Better yet, the Justice Department should produce its own model standards. And before the federal government starts distributing hundreds of millions of dollars, Congress should think about requiring all police departments that get money to take some basic care."
The Washington Post,L,Dangerous Super Typhoon Hagupit on collision course with Philippines - The Washington Post," By Angela Fritz December 4 at 11:31 AM  Follow @angelafritz      Infrared satellite image of Super Typhoon Hagupit on Thursday morning. Hagupit is expected to make landfall somewhere in the Philippines between Saturday and Sunday, though the potential track remains uncertain. (NOAA/NASA and RAMMB/CIRA)  Super Typhoon Hagupit, which exploded in intensity on Wednesday evening, is on a collision course with the Philippines. The only question that remains is where exactly the dangerous storm will make landfall. In the six hours between 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Typhoon Hagupit’s winds ballooned from 115 mph to 150 mph, pushing the storm into “super typhoon” status. It didn’t stop there, continuing to intensify into a 180 mph storm overnight. On Wednesday morning, Super Typhoon Haguput was still boasting sustained winds of 175 mph, with gusts over 200 mph.    Super Typhoon Hagupit’s eye on Wednesday night. (NOAA/NASA and RAMMB/CIRA)  Hagupit has likely peaked at its maximum intensity, though will remain an extremely dangerous storm as it approaches the Philippines over the next couple of days. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center forecasts Hagupit to be the equivalent of a category 4 hurricane as it roars ashore between Saturday and Sunday. While the track forecasts have come into somewhat better agreement since Wednesday, there is still a large amount of uncertainty about exactly where the center of the typhoon, containing the most destructive winds, will come ashore.    Track forecasts on Thursday morning from the three agencies forecasting Typhoon Hagupit. (CNN/Brandon Miller)  The Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which produces forecasts for the U.S. Navy, continues to forecast a track farther north than the other two agencies. The JTWC suggests Hagupit will brush over Northern Samar before making another landfall in the Bicol Region. The forecasts from the other two agencies covering the storm are much more dire for the region of the Philippines that is still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. Both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Philippines weather service are forecasting a track that brings the typhoon ashore closer to the still-devastated city of Tacloban. The threat of Hagupit comes just one year after deadly Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines with sustained winds up to an incredible 195 mph. Tacloban itself felt the worst impacts of the storm, being just north of the eye. Haiyan is the deadliest typhoon on record for the country, having killed at least 6,000 people.    Forecast track as of Thursday morning for Typhoon Hagupit from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. (JTWC)  No matter the agency you rely on, the potential error in each of the forecast tracks is huge. The cone of uncertainty in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center’s track, for example, extends across nearly all of the islands, putting millions on high alert.      Residents in the central Philippines fled coastal homes and stocked up on supplies as an approaching powerful storm brought back nightmares of last year's deadly onslaught from Typhoon Haiyan. (AP)   GMA News in the Philippines reports that 21 regions in the Philippines have been placed under “storm signal” alerts, illustrating the uncertainty in the typhoon’s potential landfall location: The following areas have been placed under Storm Signal No. 2: Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Samar, Biliran, Leyte, Southern Leyte, Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Island, and Siargao Island. Signal No. 1 is raised over Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate including Ticao Island, Cebu City, Northern Cebu, Bantayan Island, Camotes Island, Bohol, Surigao del Sur, Camiguin Island, and Agusan del Norte.    Super Typhoon Hagupit’s outer bands have already reached the Philippines on Thursday. Landfall is not expected until Saturday or Sunday. (Weather Underground)  Super Typhoon Hagupit’s outer bands have already reached the Philippines on Thursday morning. However, as forecast, Haguput has begun to slow down as it approaches the island nation, increasing the duration of the storm’s impacts, and with it the potential for widespread flooding. The center of the typhoon is not expected to make landfall until Saturday or Sunday. In other words, the Philippines will be lashed by Hagupit for multiple days before its impacts finally wane."

The Washington Post,L,Knox County cop fired immediately after photos show brutal choking of student - The Washington Post," By Nick Kirkpatrick April 28  Follow @n_kirkpatrick   Usually, after charges of police brutality, police officials take their time reacting while they follow procedure to determine who did what. But this episode in Knoxville, Tenn., was so extreme and well-documented that the local sheriff fired the officer immediately. Frank Phillips, a Knox County Sheriff’s officer, was fired Sunday night after a series of pictures taken by photographer John Messner were published in the Daily Mail in Britain. They showed an officer identified by the Sheriff’s Office as Phillips grabbing 21-year-old college student Jarod Dotson around the neck and squeezing him until he fell to his knees.    An officer identified by the Sheriff’s office as Frank Phillips is seen choking college student Jarod Dotson while he was being arrested for public intoxication and resisting arrest. (John Messner)  WBIR reports that law enforcement responded to a “disturbance” near the University of Tennessee where a house party with about 800 people had reportedly become unruly and spilled out into the street. According to a police report, Dotson ignored repeated instructions to go inside, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported. Deputy Brandon Gilliam wrote in the official report that Dotson “began to physically resist officers’ instructions to place his hands behind his back, and at one point grabbed on to an officer’s leg.” Messner, a freelance photographer who documented the incident, told The Washington Post that Dotson showed no signs of resisting arrest. Messner’s still pictures, arranged by The Post in the GIF below, show two officers cuffing Dotson’s hands behind his back when Phillips came over and choked Dotson until he collapsed to his knees. Messner said that as Dotson was being pulled up he was smacked in the back of the head, “a snap-out-of-it kinda smack under the circumstances.”    An officer identified by the Sheriff’s Office as Frank Phillips is seen choking college student Jarod Dotson while he was being arrested for public intoxication and resisting arrest. (John Messner)  Jarod Dotson was charged with public intoxication and resisting arrest. He was released from jail on a $500 bond Sunday morning. In a press release on Sunday night, Sheriff Jimmy “J.J.” Jones said: “In my 34 years of law enforcement experience, excessive force has never been tolerated. After an investigation by the Office of Professional Standards, I believe excessive force was used in this incident. The investigation will now be turned over to the Knox County Attorney General’s Office to determine any further action.”"
The Washington Post,L,Could ‘Barry’ sue Lena Dunham over her memoirs? - The Washington Post," By Eugene Volokh December 4 at 5:55 PM  Follow @volokhc      Actress Lena Dunham holds her memoir, “Not That Kind of Girl,” ahead of a book signing in Piccadilly in central London in October. (Joel Ryan/Invision via Associated Press)  A reader writes: I think … VC/Wapo readers (including those sympathetic to Ms. Dunham) would be interested in your thoughts on whether Barry “One” (as the … Breitbart article refers to him) has a potential cause of action against Lena Dunham and/or Random House for negligence, [intentional infliction of emotional distress], false light, libel, whatever (assuming he can prove that he did not rape or otherwise have sex with Ms. Dunham as described in her memoir). At least to me, the question of whether an author can be held liable (consistent with the First Amendment) for intentionally or unintentionally (but negligently, if proved) ruining an innocent person’s reputation or life, is very interesting …. And in the Breitbart article, it mentions that Barry has hired a lawyer, so legal action may be being contemplated (in the Kevin Williamson piece in National Review … Barry expresses that this is taking an immense, negative toll on him and his family). A very interesting question, to which it turns out that there’s a good legal answer (assuming we can figure out the facts). 1. Lena Dunham’s memoir describes her having sex with someone named Barry, whom she labels as Oberlin’s “resident conservative.” Her description seems to me to leave it somewhat ambiguous as to whether Barry raped her, but it does describe some sexual behavior by Barry that at the very least reflects badly on him. There are two passages in which she describes the incident: one in which it comes across as consensual but unsatisfying, and another one that she begins by saying, I’m an unreliable narrator. Because I add an invented detail to almost every story I tell about my mother. Because my sister claims every memory we “share” has been fabricated by me to impress a crowd. Because I get “sick” a lot. Because I use the same low “duhhh” voice for every guy I’ve ever known, except for the put-off adult voice I use to imitate my dad. But mostly because in another essay in this book I describe a sexual encounter with a mustachioed campus Republican as the upsetting but educational choice of a girl who was new to sex when, in fact, it didn’t feel like a choice at all. The pages that follow, which thus seem to purportedly describe what happened “in fact,” give a good number of details of Barry’s alleged sexual behavior toward her; see the Breitbart News story (John Nolte, Big Hollywood) for some of those details. 2. The Breitbart News story states that there was indeed a well-known conservative student at Oberlin named Barry and that he could easily be identified by people who want to figure out who he is — and that he has indeed been so identified by many people. (I indeed managed to do this easily myself.) Kevin Williamson (National Review), a prominent critic of Dunham’s, reports the same. But the Breitbart News story also alleges that the other details in Dunham’s story, such as Barry’s appearance (e.g., his mustache) and campus job (e.g., his having hosted a radio talk show called “Real Talk With Jimbo”), seem to be inaccurate. And the story alleges that there was no one else named Barry who was a prominent campus conservative. From there, Breitbart News expresses doubts that Dunham actually was involved in such an incident with a conservative named Barry. 3. So those are the facts (item 1, which I can attest to personally, having looked at Dunham’s memoir) and the allegations that Dunham’s account is incorrect (item 2, the substance of which I can’t verify personally). Assuming that the Breitbart allegations are correct, would Dunham’s statements be legally actionable, if Identifiable Conservative Barry sues? The answer doesn’t require us to delve into negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress, because this would be a classic defamation case. Identifiable Conservative Barry would argue that  Dunham said things about him that injured his reputation with some people because some people reasonably identified him as the Barry she mentions and yet, those statements were false, in that no conservative Oberlin student named Barry actually did to her what she says was done to her, even if someone else with another name or other identifying characteristics did this, and Dunham knew that the statements were false, in that she knew that no conservative Oberlin Barry did this to her.  Nor does it matter that Barry’s last name was not used. As the Restatement (Second) of Torts says (emphasis and some paragraph breaks added), A defamatory communication is made concerning the person to whom its recipient correctly, or mistakenly but reasonably, understands that it was intended to refer…. Comment b. Person mistakenly but reasonably believed to be intended. If the communication is reasonably understood by the person to whom it is made as intended to refer to the plaintiff, it is not decisive that the defamer did not intend to refer to him. It is not enough however, that the defamatory matter is actually understood as intended to refer to the plaintiff; the interpretation must be reasonable in the light of all the circumstances. It is not necessary that the plaintiff be designated by name; it is enough that there is such a description of or reference to him that those who hear or read reasonably understand the plaintiff to be the person intended.… It is not necessary that everyone recognize the other as the person intended; it is enough that any recipient of the communication reasonably so understands it…. [T]he defamer is subject to liability if he knew that the communication would be understood by the recipient to refer to the plaintiff or was negligent in failing to recognize that this might happen. If the recipient reasonably understood the communication to be made concerning the plaintiff, it may be inferred that the defamer was negligent in failing to realize that the communication would be so understood…. To be sure, if this sort of misunderstanding happens without fault on the speaker’s part, or when it’s unreasonable for people to assume the statement is about the plaintiff, there would be no liability. If I write accurately about something bad done by someone I identify only as Bill, that isn’t a basis for every Bill in the world to sue me, claiming that the statement libels him. I accurately reported the facts, it’s unreasonable for people to assume just based on the name Bill that my statement is about any Bill in particular, and it’s therefore reasonable for me just to call him Bill. Likewise, if I write an obviously fictional story that mentions someone named Cathy, and even give quite a few details, it’s generally unreasonable for people to assume that this is about any particular Cathy (even one who happens to share the description I offered in my fictional work). At least this is so unless there’s some indication that the reference really isn’t entirely fictional; there’s actually some interesting and controversial case law on facially fictional accounts that are nonetheless seen as implicitly making factual claims. But say I write something that on its face seems to be, and is reasonably perceived to be, a factual claim that someone did something bad to me. And say I use a first name coupled with identifying characteristics that would lead reasonable people to perceive that the person is a particular person. People do so reasonably perceive, but it turns out that my account was wrong — the incident actually involved someone with a different first name, or different identifying characteristics. Unless I made a reasonable mistake, I would be potentially liable for defamation. And that would be the Dunham story, if the Breitbart assertions are correct, and Dunham knew (or at least should have known) that the incident didn’t involve an Oberlin conservative named Barry. To be sure, people who knew Identifiable Conservative Barry very well would realize that her story couldn’t be about him (again, assuming the Breitbart report is right), since he never had the mustache that Dunham described and never worked on the radio show that Dunham mentioned. But people who know some details about Identifiable Conservative Barry — he was named Barry, he was conservative, he was at Oberlin at the same time Dunham was — whether because they know him personally or because they track him down using those details, would perceive him as the Barry that Dunham was talking about. And the damage to his reputation in those people’s eyes would be sufficient for a libel claim (again, assuming the facts are as Breitbart reports). 4. But there’s one important twist: Any such libel lawsuit is dangerous for plaintiffs in this situation, even if they are entirely innocent. Right now, only a relatively few people link Identifiable Conservative Barry’s name to Dunham’s story, precisely because his last name wasn’t used. If Identifiable Conservative Barry sues, he becomes Identified Conservative Barry, and many more people will link his name to Dunham’s story. Then, even if he prevails in court, or gets Dunham to publish an apology, some people will have learned of the accusation but won’t hear (or remember or believe) the vindication. This, for better or worse (or perhaps sometimes for better and sometimes for worse), is one of the costs of libel litigation: It amplifies the original accusation, and sometimes it takes a statement that injured the plaintiff’s reputation only among a few people and turns it into a statement that injured his reputation among many — again, even if he ultimately “wins” the case. Sometimes a sad reality, but a reality nonetheless."

Mike Hankey from the American Meteor Society has annotated the image to point out the location of the fireball. (NASA/Bill Cooke via AMS)  A bright fireball lit up the Northeast sky on Wednesday night as it streaked over southern Canada and upstate New York. The fireball occurred at around 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday. The American Meteor Society estimates that the fireball began over Ontario County in northwest New York and traveled west-northwest over Canada before terminating southwest of Toronto.    Estimated path of Wednesday night’s fireball. (American Meteor Society)  “Many witnesses described an increasing intensity before it terminated,” writes Mike Hankey of the American Meteor Society, “a common trait of bolide meteors.” A bolide is a particularly bright meteor that explodes in a flash near the end of it’s path. Nearly 200 sightings have been reported on the society’s website, from Detroit to central Massachusetts and south into the Mid-Atlantic.    A heat map of the fireball reports submitted to the American Meteor Society. (American Meteor Society)  The fireball was seen as far south as the D.C. region, where many of our followers on Twitter were lucky enough to be outside for the event.   @capitalweather Nice fireball seen from Frederick 8:26 pm falling to the north from high northeast. — John Cosby (@JohnDCosby) December 4, 2014    @capitalweather Streak was pretty short, skipped a bit, then made one last green flash. — DaveS (@darsal) December 4, 2014    @JustinWeather @capitalweather Saw a fireball in the sky about 10 min ago in Jessup/Columbia. — Adam Minakowski (@minakowski) December 4, 2014    @capitalweather saw it from purcellville, VA.

The Washington Post,L,"Defense spending bill passes, sequester must now go - The Washington Post"," By Jennifer Rubin December 4 at 6:30 PM  Follow @JRubinBlogger   The National Defense Authorization Act passed the House today with a huge, bipartisan majority of 300 to 119. The bill to fund the military (in the amount of $585 billion) now goes to the Senate where it has bipartisan support. In an emailed statement, majority leader Kevin McCarthy (R- Calif.) summarized its key provisions: “The bill funds troop readiness and also supports our military operations against ISIL in Iraq and Syria, while ensuring increased Congressional oversight on these activities. It also explicitly prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States and denies funding for any terrorist detention facilities on American soil. Notably, the bill also prohibits another round of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process from being carried out in 2015.”    Representative Howard “Buck” McKeon, a Republican from California and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, top right, chairs a hearing with Chuck Hagel, U.S. secretary of defense, not pictured, during a House Armed Services Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, June 11, 2014. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  It did not include a bipartisan measure from Sen. Kristian Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Susan Collins (R-Me.) and others that would have taken investigation and punishment of sexual assaults outside the chain of command. The measure drew harsh objections from the Pentagon and pro-defense lawmakers. A GOP aide sneered, saying senators were in essence “giving a sloppy kiss to an amendment that takes authority out of the hands of military commanders, the guys who know their troops the best, and puts it in the hands of government bureaucrats.” (Building on past legislation, further reforms supported by the military are included in the House bill.) With regard to the substance of the bill, the House Armed Services Committee summary observed: This year’s budget request reflects years of compounding resource cuts to national security. Indeed, President Obama has directed over $1 trillion in cuts to the military since he took office. The President’s FY15 base budget request is $31 billion less than called for in his FY14 budget. His request paid for the cuts by dramatically reducing the size of the military, increasing out of pocket expenses for military families, and cutting vital programs. Armed Services Members are not prepared to accept a smaller less capable force at this time. Members from both parties worked hard to find savings in less critical areas that do not pose the threat of irrevocable damage to the force or the potential to harm recruiting or retention. Still, at current resource levels, tough choices must be made. On military readiness the HASC warned: Our military is experiencing ever growing challenges maintaining readiness as a result of sequestration, leading to a system of tiered readiness where only deploying military personnel are fully trained and ready to deploy. To address this concern the NDAA builds on the work done by Chairman Rob Wittman (R-VA) and the Subcommittee on Readiness to provide over $212 billion for operation and maintenance requirements funding activities such as ship refueling and overhaul, depot maintenance, and facilities sustainment. The NDAA further addresses critical readiness gaps associated with depot maintenance, flying hour programs and base operations support caused by sequestration and repeated resource cuts. These are achieved by diverting funds from lower priority items. Members remain concerned however that if resource trends are not reversed soon, any tentative gains in these accounts will be diminished or eliminated. Consistently failing to meet appropriate levels of combat readiness places our troops at risk. In a moving goodbye speech, retiring chairman Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) admonished his colleagues to end the sequester limits. Asking them to think of the troops, he deplored the “shame” in failing to adequately equip, prepare, pay and care for them. Indeed, the next Congress will need to address the knotty issue of the sequester in order to put the military on sound footing and allow it to plan for the future. “Sequester is Latin for politicians doing dumb things,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) likes to say. In a Capitol Hill interview with me he vowed to take on the sequester cuts. He was candid that refunding defense will require both sides to give something. He said, “There is no social security without national security. . . A strong government starts with a strong national defense.” His idea is to “buy back” most of the sequester with a combination of entitlement reform and closing tax expenditures aimed at discrete businesses. Without opening up all entitlement reform he wants to consider eliminating the Medicare Part D drug subsidy for those making $200,000 or more and extend the budgeting window to stretch out and lessen the yearly reductions. But he will also insist on Pentagon reforms on personnel, acquisition, and retirement to eliminate waste and excess. “I will be leading that fight,” he says. Graham has been consistent on the sequester. “I voted against the sequester,” Graham recalled. “My concern was that when it comes to Congress expect the worst and you won’t be disappointed.” As he predicted, the super-committee failed and we are now cannibalizing our own defense. “Now here we are and everything I feared would come to pass has. I would say to libertarians in my party [who likely will want all tax loophole savings to go to tax rate reduction] security is the first and biggest obligation of the federal government. The tax code is not going to keep ISIL at bay.” He adds, “If we cannot buyback the sequester we have lost our way.” New pro-defense senators will join Graham, but they will be tested with hard votes. They may imagine they can “force” the president to take all the savings out of domestic items, but they can stick to that position or solve the problem,  but not both with this president. They will need to decide if their rhetoric on the primacy of national security outweighs ideological purity on revenue. McKeon has been exemplary in highlighting the need to replenish the military; now it will be up to Graham and his old and new colleagues to get that job done. "
The Washington Post,L,Denard Span has sports hernia surgery (updated) - The Washington Post," By James Wagner December 3  Follow @jameswagnerwp      (Patrick Smith/Getty Images)  Denard Span underwent sports hernia surgery, the Nationals announced on Wednesday morning. The minor surgery was deemed successful, and the center fielder is expected to be ready for spring training. Span said he tweaked that area toward the end of the season but didn’t consider it serious. When he recently started offseason workouts, the injured area felt better but had not improved to the point where he felt it needed to be. He was evaluated and had the surgery. Span tweeted out a photo of himself in the hospital bed on Wednesday morning: God is so good! I doubted whether or not I would make it thru this but he saw me through this! So thankful. pic.twitter.com/U0PggLjKWb — Denard Span (@thisisdspan) December 3, 2014 Sports hernias are strains or tears of soft tissue in the lower abdomen or groin area. Span, 30, had one of his finest major league seasons in 2014, hitting .302 with 31 stolen bases and playing strong defense. The Nationals picked up his $9 million option for 2015 after the season. "
The Washington Post,L,"In the ‘global struggle for Internet freedom,’ the Internet is losing, report finds - The Washington Post"," By Nancy Scola December 4 at 12:30 PM  Follow @nancyscola    The year 2014 marks the moment that the world turned its attention to writing laws to govern what happens on the Internet. And that has not been a great thing, according to an annual report from the U.S.-based pro-democracy think tank Freedom House. Traditionally, countries eager to crack down on their online critics largely resorted to blocking Web sites and filtering Internet content, with the occasional offline harassment of dissidents. But that has changed, in part because online activists have gotten better at figuring out ways around those restrictions; Freedom House points to Greatfire, a service that takes content blocked in mainland China and hosts it on big, global platforms, like Amazon's servers, that the Chinese government finds both politically and technologically difficult to block. In the wake of these tactics, repressive regimes have begun opting for a ""technically uncensored Internet,"" Freedom House finds, but one that is increasingly controlled by national laws about what can and can't be done online. In 36 of the 65 countries surveyed around the world  the state of Internet freedom declined in 2014, according to the report. Russia, for example, passed a law that allows the country's prosecutor general to block ""extremist"" Web sites without any judicial oversight. Kazakstan passed a similar law. Vietnam passed decrees cracking down on any critiques of the state on social media sites. Nigeria passed a law requiring that Internet cafes keep logs of the customers who come into their shops and use their computers. There's a bigger worry at work, too, Freedom House says: the potential for a ""snowball effect."" More and more countries, the thinking goes, will adopt these sorts of restrictive laws. And the more that such laws are put in place, the more they fall within the range of acceptable global norms. Also shifting those norms? According to Freedom House, ""Some states are using the revelations of widespread surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as an excuse to augment their own monitoring capabilities, frequently with little or no oversight, and often aimed at the political opposition and human rights activists."" Indeed, in the United States, too, 2014 has been a time of writing rules about the Internet into law. The Federal Communications Commission will not manage to wrap up work on so-called net neutrality rulemaking by Dec. 31, but there's no doubt that this year marks the first time the American public got hugely engaged in the debate over how the Internet should operate within our borders. It's worth noting that there were a few bright spots elsewhere in the report. India relaxed a rule on online access and content that it had put in place last year after riots in the country's northeast. Meanwhile, Brazil passed an ""Internet bill of rights"" -- called Marco Civil da Internet -- that has both net neutrality and privacy protections. This year also saw the start of a global attempt to create a set of pro-Internet model laws under the banner of the NETmundial Initiative, with the support of Brazil and the nonprofit Internet governance organization ICANN. But that effort is only just now getting off the ground. And as the Freedom House report shows, world leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and others aren't waiting around for its guidance."
The Washington Post,L,Body cameras won’t stop police brutality. Eric Garner is only one of several reasons why. - The Washington Post,"  By Justin Hansford December 4 at 2:02 PM Follow @Blackstarjus  Justin Hansford is a human rights activist and law professor at Saint Louis University School of Law. He is a graduate of Howard University and Georgetown University Law Center.      Video evidence of the fatal chokehold that killed Eric Garner didn’t help indict the police officer. (NY Daily News via Getty Images)  President Obama announced this week a proposal to spend $75 million on body cameras for 50,000 police officers nationwide. He framed this as a solution to widespread distrust of law enforcement in minority communities. But the failure to indict the New York City police officer whose chokehold killed Eric Garner — an incident vividly captured on video — proves just how ineffective Obama’s plan would be in curbing epidemic police violence and racial profiling. The officers who forcibly pushed Garner’s body into the ground knew a witness was recording the incident, and at least one of them spoke to the videographer. And yet, the police were undeterred. They continued using the banned chokehold on Garner as he repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe!” In the Garner case, the cellphone video provided a far superior view of what happened than a body camera would have, and still police suffered no criminal consequences. It’s not the first time this has happened. In September, an Ohio grand jury failed to indict the police officers who killed John Crawford in a Wal-Mart, where he had picked up an air rifle from the shelf. And earlier this year, a man in Oklahoma stopped breathing in a movie theater parking lot after several police officers forced him to the ground when he refused to hand over his ID. His wife filmed the fatal incident on her cellphone, but the district attorney said the officers’ actions were justified. Officers are rarely charged in these kinds of incidents, whether there’s video evidence or not. During the seven years ending in 2011, just 41 police officers were charged with murder or manslaughter after shootings, according to FBI statistics compiled by The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, more than 2,700 homicides by law enforcement were deemed justified. Few entities are given so much authority with so little accountability. Ultimately, body cameras could do more harm than good to the cause of protecting citizens from police violence. Pinned to officers’ chests, these cameras face outward — capturing the behavior of citizens, but not of the police. Their footage provides a one-sided view of the interaction, allowing outsiders to scrutinize the citizens’ every move, but leaving them blind to the police officers’ behavior. For instance, while protesting in Ferguson, I witnessed police pointing guns at nonviolent citizens. Media cameras and citizens’ cellphones captured some of that behavior, as well. But police body cameras only would have shown citizens’ angry reactions out of context, missing the officers’ provocation. Body cameras do much more to capture evidence against citizens than to protect them. It’s lax laws that prevent us from holding police accountable, not a lack of evidence. But the presence of police body cameras will simply lull the country into believing that we can solve the problems of racial profiling and police violence without holding police accountable for their actions. In an environment where state excessive force laws make criminal conviction of police officers for murder almost impossible, a police officer literally has nothing to lose by killing unarmed black men. Even in civil suits, officers are never personally financially responsible for paying for damages — state and local governments cover it for them.  For the officers involved, there is a miniscule chance of either serving time in jail or paying a dime in damages, regardless of whether or not the incident is recorded. This is the textbook definition of impunity. In addition to their ineffectiveness, the  information captured by body cameras raises serious questions about citizen privacy. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure and many jurisdictions prohibit recording of a person without his or her consent if the surveillance takes place in an area of expected privacy. Police enter areas of this type every day. Also, the recent scandals surrounding NSA surveillance of telephone and Internet activity has already demonstrated the nation’s uneasiness about the proliferation of digital surveillance capacity among law enforcement under the guise of keeping us safe. We have yet to fully explore the Fourth Amendment ramifications of this type of constant recording of citizens by police officers. The big brother state stands in direct contradiction to the freedom from unreasonable searches that the Fourth Amendment guarantees us. President Obama isn’t alone in his misguided approach. Across the country, local police departments are considering the use of body cameras and perpetuating the view that this will end police brutality. But if this country wants to get serious about this problem, we should do what government always does when it wants to alter behavior on a systematic level — impose financial penalties. For example, the proposed End Racial Profiling Act would mandate policies that prohibit racial profiling by federal law enforcement and by state and local agencies that receive federal funding. That’s a start on the racial profiling side.  Another proposal that has gained traction locally is the creation of mandatory personal liability insurance for police officers.  Even if cities decide to pay the base premiums for police, the increased premiums for officers prone to violence and brutality would provide a measure of accountability.  That’s a start on the police violence side. In the absence of accountability, financial or criminal, we can expect no changes in police behavior. The roots of the problem are too deep.  For real change to happen, it has to cost them something. More from PostEverything:  What caused the Ferguson riot exists in so many other cities, too Filming police is the American thing to do. As a federal prosecutor, I know how hard it is to charge officers like Darren Wilson"

The Washington Post,L,"The strength, and limits, of de Blasio’s speech about Eric Garner - The Washington Post"," By Jena McGregor December 4 at 9:18 AM  Follow @jenamcgregor      (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio gave a poignant and powerful speech on Wednesday in the wake of a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer who put Eric Garner in a chokehold that led to his death in July. His remarks preceded a night of protests throughout the city that blocked traffic on the city's West Side Highway, prompted ""die-ins"" at Grand Central Terminal, and inspired hundreds of protestors to march through the streets chanting ""I can't breathe,"" Garner's last words. De Blasio's speech is unlikely to blunt criticism of the ""broken windows"" policing approach that may have played a role in what happened to Eric Garner — or in the simmering distrust of police in Ferguson, Mo., where teenager Michael Brown's death sparked riots and national protests. But de Blasio's words, as well as his decision to cancel a bill signing and an appearance at the Rockefeller Center tree lighting event to instead head to Staten Island, stood in stark contrast to the public officials in Ferguson who often seemed absent as the crisis unfolded there. In the speech, de Blasio spoke of the fear too many young people have of police. He sent a signal to those angry on social media, in their homes and in the streets, by echoing the line ""black lives matter"" — a refrain from the protests ""that should never have to be said,"" but that ""our history, sadly, requires."" And, movingly, de Blasio shared his own personal story: the challenges of raising a biracial son in communities where distrust of the police has only grown. ""We've had to literally train him, as families have all over this city for decades, in how to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers,"" de Blasio said. He spoke of the worry, and the very real pain, of being that parent today. Again, he made his remarks personal while also repeating that his concerns are shared by millions of other families. ""Was Dante safe each night? There are so many families in this city who feel that each and every night. Is my child safe? And not just from some of the painful realities — crime and violence in some of our neighborhoods — but are they safe from the very people they want to have faith in as their protectors?"" That ability to empathize may be a unique advantage de Blasio possesses. It's a ""rhetorical strength,"" as the New York Times wrote, that made him appear to be ""trying to preside over the day's events, rather than to steer them."" His wife is African American, his children are biracial, and he can speak about the fear and challenges of parenting them with a credibility that many other elected leaders cannot. And he used that perspective to great effect, speaking as a father and sharing words that had the power to resonated with grieving, angry families. Whatever goodwill his speech engendered will not, of course, be enough to quiet critics who question the policing approach that is associated with the police chief he hired, William Bratton. De Blasio campaigned on ending the police department's controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" tactics, and brought on Bratton a year ago this week to help him do so. But many see the controversial ""broken windows"" approach, which has police aggressively go after small crimes in order to prevent bigger ones, as part of the problem. Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) has called it ""just a cousin to stop-and-frisk."" At the very least, de Blasio should initiate a critical review of the real effectiveness, versus potential damage, of policies that focus on petty crimes. And he should ensure that Bratton's earlier call for a ""fundamental shift in the culture of the department,"" as well as his promises to rid the force of officers ""who [are] 'brutal,' who are 'corrupt,' who are 'racist,' who are 'incompetent,'"" are followed up by palpable changes. De Blasio's speech was poignant because it was personal, credible and empathetic. He demonstrated that he understands this is a time of searing pain for many communities. It was the right speech for the moment. But the next one needs to outline accountable action in reforming a police department that is still much in need of real change.

Two or three of them are old varieties — “old” as in poinsettias that have been around for a mere decade or so, but the others are new kids on the block.   Adrian Higgins has been writing about the intersection of gardening and life for more than 25 years, and joined the Post in 1994. He is the author of several books, including the ""Washington Post Garden Book"" and ""Chanticleer, a Pleasure Garden."" View Archive    Sparkling Punch has big pink blooms with creamy centers; Cinnamon Star has petals — technically, colored bracts — that start lime green before turning to a rich salmon. Visions of Grandeur is full of ruffled, soft-pink blossoms above apple-green leaves. Traditional red bloomers remain the definitive holiday poinsettia, but one in three of Wheeler’s poinsettias is not red.   Novelty poinsettias reflect the most obvious evolution of the plant in recent years, but they are part of a much greater transformation since Wheeler first raised them 30 years ago. Apart from their greater variety, poinsettias have generally become a tougher, longer-lived and ubiquitous mass-market item.   Once a high-maintenance, two-week wonder in mid-December, the poinsettia makes its flamboyant entrance in time for Black Friday and struts its stuff well into the NewYear. This may be good news for the consumer, but for the poinsettia the advances have been a lifesaver.   The Marbella variety of poinsettia. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)  “It was in a state of decline,” said Gary Vollmer, product manager for Selecta, a major breeder and producer of poinsettias for growers such as Bell. Commercial poinsettias are raised from cuttings planted in early summer. The poinsettia’s fortunes today are based on a watershed discovery several decades ago, when breeders figured out how to make the cuttings branch — a breakthrough that allowed growers to produce more floriferous pots with fewer cuttings. (Wheeler’s 10-inch pots contain just three cuttings, which produce a total of 20 or more blooms). But it has been advances since 2000 that have breathed new life into the holiday-season icon. Breeders have been building on early work in Europe to extend the shelf life of poinsettias by selecting a number of related traits. The earliest forms of potted poinsettia, introduced by a California grower in the 1920s, would look primitive compared with the 21st-century article.  Even compared with just a few years ago, today’s varieties have branches that are more upright (less stress for sleeving), have longer-lasting cyathia (the yellow buds in the center of the bracts) and have bracts that are relatively small and stick out (rather than down) to reduce damage.  At Selecta, hybridizers simulate the rigors of interstate truck shipping, warehouse storage, temperature fluctuations and crowding in plastic sleeves as part of the evaluation of commercial candidates, Vollmer said. Poinsettias color up — ripen, in growers’ parlance — in response to the shorter day lengths of fall. Previously, growers had to fool the plants into thinking autumn had started early by shading them with black cloth. Today, hybridizers have bred early-season coloring into them naturally. All these advances have fostered not just an earlier start to poinsettia season but also development of a mass market for an item that was once a premium article of the florist.   The Sparkling Punch variety of poinsettia. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)  Bell greenhouses in Maryland, Virginia and Ohio supply 178 Home Depot stores from North Carolina to Philadelphia, and large-volume growers such as Bell will furnish American consumers with 80 million poinsettias between now and Christmas. This week marks the prime shipping period for Bell — next week will be the peak sales week, much of it driven by sales of poinsettia gifts (predominantly of safe red varieties). The shift to mass-merchandiser sales has also influenced the size of plants and the breeding programs that support them. The Black Friday loss leaders tend to be in four- or six-inch pots, while the upsizing of larger poinsettias, from eight- to 10-inch pots by Costco a few years ago , created a new marquee norm for the big-box sellers, Vollmer said. Because both of those types tend to be red, the proportion of red poinsettias nationally has climbed to about 85 percent of all poinsettias. But Wheeler said his percentage of reds has dropped to 65 percent as novelties have come to the fore in Bell’s Mid-Atlantic market. Some of them are not to my taste — I find the hotter pinks a bit tacky, even with variegation — but no one can deny the eye-catching and festive qualities of a series of similar varieties known as jingle poinsettias — they have oaklike leaves and spotted red and creamy yellow petals. One variety is Red Glitter, another is Sonora White Glitter. Whites can look elegant, but finding a true, clear white is difficult. Poinsettia genetics tend to produce whites that lean to green and others that lean to beige, the latter having a yellow cast to them. I happen to like both, though perhaps not next to each other.  At the Smithsonian’s production greenhouses in Suitland, horticulturists Melanie Pyle and Jill Gonzalez showed me Whitestar, a large-flowered bright white. Whitestar was used extensively for spray-painting when that was a fad. Some retailers still gussy up poinsettias with dye and glitter, but that seems to have retreated to a small segment of the market.  Among the brighter whites, Wheeler commends Polar Bear and Arctic White, a later poinsettia that is pleasantly creamy and with green venation as it colors up, though the bracts are on the small side. There has been much breeding also of the dominant red varieties, again for the traits that growers and retailers are looking for. In some trials, Wheeler said, the color differences in red varieties can be extremely subtle. He grows, among others, Jubilee Red, a strong medium red; Early Orion Red, a rich scarlet poinsettia grown for its early coloring; and Freedom Red, a classic dark red poinsettia.  Culturally, Europeans tend to like the brighter scarlet forms. In North America, consumers favor a deeper, crimson-hued poinsettia, especially if the green leaf color is also a darker shade. But tastes are individual. When it comes to non-red varieties, breeders are keen to find a better white. The purest whites tend to have thin petals, which makes them prone to damage. Because whites make up 10 percent of sales, the discovery of a tough but clear white variety could capture much of that market. “From a breeder’s perspective, that’s the target everybody is going after,” Vollmer said. The other is to find a better maroon-purple. The dominant variety is Cortez Burgundy, which has “beautiful color but a lot of production weaknesses,” he said. Visions of sugarplums may dance in our slumbered heads, but there are some people out there who dream of a purple-petaled poinsettia that grows willingly and can take the rough and tumble of the modern marketplace. “We have been desperately trying to get one for a few years,” he said.  How to care for your poinsettia   ● Buying  You can tell the age of a poinsettia by the stage of development of the green and yellow buds in the center of the “blooms.” These are the true flowers, and the tighter they are, the younger the plant. Poinsettias dislike temperatures below 50 degrees, so they should be taken home in a protective wrapping and certainly not left in a car while you go shopping for two hours. The colored bracts and leaves bruise easily, causing the milky sap to bleed, so they should be handled with care.  ● At home  Poinsettias like a room with bright, indirect light and temperatures below 70 degrees. Keep them away from drafts and sources of heat. They need moderately moist but not wet soil. The pots should not get too dry; don’t wait until they wilt badly before watering. Decorative foil will impede drainage, so you should either make holes in the bottom of the foil, remove it when watering or take it off altogether. Rest the pots on a saucer.  ● After the holiday season   The effortto get poinsettias to survive, regrow and “re-bloom” is burdensome and only worth it if you like a green-thumb challenge. They color up after nine weeks of shorter days following the autumn equinox. If you want blooms before next Christmas, you must keep the plants indoors in a place where they will get light during the day but none after dark. Leaving a light bulb on by mistake will mess up the schedule. You could move your poinsettia plant from a bright room to a closet every day at dusk and back again at dawn, or you could get a life.

The Washington Post,L,"The standing problem in Zivotofsky, revisited - The Washington Post"," By Will Baude December 4 at 3:43 PM   Teaching Zivotofsky yesterday I found myself wondering: why haven’t any members of the Court questioned Zivotofsky’s standing to sue? Zivotofsky is of course the Jersualem passport case pending before the Supreme Court, which is being asked to decide whether Section 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act is constitutional. But has Zivotofsky suffered the”injury in fact” required by the Court’s standing doctrine, and thus required for the Court to decide the case? The district court initially said “no.” It took the Court’s decision in Lujan (and now one could add Summers) to say that a violation of a statutory right isn’t adequate for standing. And it didn’t think that there was any other concrete injury outside of the legal injury. The D.C. Circuit disagreed with the first point, concluding that in general violations of statutory rights do create standing. Co-blogger Eugene K. and Steve Vladeck went back and forth about this earlier this year. Eugene argued that the statute “does not create a ‘right’” and therefore that it can’t support standing. Steve responded that this objection really goes to the existence of a cause of action; the statute does create a right. I’m slow to the party, but I’m wondering about something slightly more basic. What about the district court’s objection, that even if the statute does create a right, that right isn’t a cognizable injury under Article III standing doctrine? In his post, Steve had written “I don’t think there’s any question, as I’ve explained in the surveillance context, that Congress may create non-common-law rights as a general proposition, and then confer standing upon a wide array of private individuals who, through an appropriate cause of action, may enforce them.” And while I’m sympathetic to Steve’s views here, it seems to me that some members of the Court have questioned that general proposition. This was discussed most fervently during the oral argument in First American Financial v. Edwards. Here’s Chief Justice Roberts: Can I — I’m sorry to interrupt you, and I want to pause on that question. You said violation of a statute is injury-in-fact. I would have thought that would be called injury-in-law. And when we say, as all our standing cases have, is that what is required is injury-in-fact, I understand that to be in contradistinction to injury-in-law. And when you tell me all that you’ve got or all that you want to plead is violation of the statute, that doesn’t sound like injury-in-fact. And again: You say so long as the harm is a violation of the law, a legally protected interest. Our standing cases always say injury-in-fact as opposed to injury-in-law. And yet, you’re saying if you violate the law, you have sufficient injury. Now First American Financial was eventually dismissed. The Court has called for the views of the SG in a new case that looks to me like it might raise the question again, Spokeo v. Robins, but it seems to remain an open question whether the injury-in-law skepticism will prevail. In any event: for those Justices who are skeptical, and who don’t accept Steve’s limited reading of Lujan, shouldn’t Zivotofsky’s standing actually be in serious doubt? The standing issue doesn’t seem to have been raised in the principal briefs, although I did find this amicus brief which raises the issues (and relies on Eugene K’s post too). But because standing is jurisdictional, each Justice is supposed to satisfy himself or herself that it exists before they go on to consider the merits. It seems to me that each Justice who doubts standing in First American Financial or Spokeo ought to doubt standing here too. And if not, at a minimum they ought to explain why not.

The Washington Post,L,Hillary Clinton has lost that ‘new car’ smell - The Washington Post,"   Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks in Gaston Hall at Georgetown University in Washington on Wednesday. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)     By Dana Milbank Opinion writer December 3  Follow @Milbank     There was something in the air before Hillary Clinton addressed Georgetown University students Wednesday, but it definitely wasn’t a new-car smell.  It was a faint but unmistakable whiff of indifference.  Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation’s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. View Archive   Facebook Google+ RSS   When the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination spoke in the same place a year ago, the room was reportedly packed. When she spoke in October, Gaston Hall again “was filled to capacity,” the campus newspaper reported; some students lined up overnight and others were turned away. But when it was time for Clinton’s appearance to begin Wednesday morning, half of the 700 seats in the place were empty. After a half-hour “weather delay,” diplomats and VIPs filled a few more chairs, but more than 300 remained vacant when the former secretary of state and first lady walked in wearing a robin’s-egg-blue jacket and her signature pants.  Roughly half a dozen people rose to applaud, and for a terrifying moment it appeared they might be the only ones standing. But slowly, lazily, most of the others struggled to their feet. Maybe it was just overexposure. Clinton began by joking that she’d been to Georgetown more in the last couple of years than her husband, who is an alumnus. This got a polite chuckle. A spokeswoman for the university said that this is the last week of classes, so students may be busy preparing for final exams.  But it has to be a worrisome sign for Clintonistas as they prepare to launch her 2016 juggernaut. President Obama, talking to ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos last month about Clinton’s efforts to distance herself from the unpopular president, said “the American people, you know, they’re going to want that new-car smell.” Doug Schoen, whose polling firm worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign and who now is a Fox News regular, contributed his view that his former client lacks that particular scent. The students who did show up Wednesday did not seem dazzled. They gave another polite chuckle for her reference to Harvard as “that small university up in Cambridge, Massachusetts,” but they were dead quiet during most of her speech. A few took photos with their phones; others fiddled with their hair. Several began trickling out before the 40-minute appearance was over. The main applause line Clinton generated was her reference to another woman joining her on the stage, Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide, who, Clinton said, “belongs to a small but fierce club of women who are proving they can defend their countries as well as any man.” Those who bothered to listen could have heard the rationale for Clinton’s candidacy as she spoke about the need for women to play a greater role around the world in war-fighting and diplomacy. “We know when women contribute in making and keeping peace, entire societies enjoy better outcomes,” she said. “Women leaders, it has been found, are good at building coalitions across ethnic and sectarian lines and speaking up for other marginalized groups. . . . They act more as mediators to help foster compromise and to try to organize, to create the changes they seek.” This is a smart way for Clinton to position herself. Last time, she largely avoided campaigning on her potential to be the first female president, until her famous “glass ceiling” concession speech. The bad news is she’s now tied to Obama’s foreign policy at a time when the world seems to be falling apart.  She has tried, haltingly, to draw distinctions between her hawkish views and Obama’s dovish ways. But there was nothing new-car in Wednesday’s appearance, where Clinton gave a brief exposition on her “smart power” theme and often lapsed into the bureaucratic and the banal.  “I’m a big believer in trying to make decisions based on evidence wherever possible,” she reported. She also spoke, numbingly, of her “commitment to launch a series of practical discussions on the implementation of national action plans,” and of her effort “to call for the institution of a representative to the secretary general to begin at the U.N. level to try to implement what were the sentiments and the aspirations behind these actions.” There was supposed to have been a Q&A following Clinton’s remarks, but the moderator, former Clinton adviser Melanne Verveer, said there was no time for that and instead read Clinton a single question about Syria and Ukraine. Clinton ventured her opinions that Ukraine will have to “rebuild its military forces” and that “Syria is now a multi-sided conflict.” The ride and handling were stable. The acceleration and braking were adequate. But this car was not new.   Twitter: @Milbank   Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

The Washington Post,L,Obama to nominate next secretary of defense tomorrow - The Washington Post," By Missy Ryan December 4 at 2:15 PM  Follow @missy_ryan      Ashton Carter, who is widely expected to be President Obama’s nominee as secretary of defense, testifies on Capitol Hill in February 2013.  (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  President Barack Obama will nominate a new defense chief on Friday to replace Chuck Hagel, who is departing the Pentagon as the United States expands its fight against Islamic State militants in the Middle East, the White House said on Thursday. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters the announcement would be made on Friday but declined to say who the president’s nominee would be. Current and former officials say that Obama will nominate Ashton B. Carter, a physicist and former academic who previously served as the Pentagon’s second highest ranking official, for the job. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, announced that he would depart the Pentagon following weeks of speculation about a rift between the Pentagon leadership and the White House. Hagel, a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war, took over in early 2013 charged with reforming the Pentagon budget and ushering the U.S. military out of a dozen years of war. But senior officials indicated that Obama wanted a change as the U.S. military broadens its operations in Iraq and Syria against the extremist group that captured a wide swathe of territory in both countries. Senior lawmakers have indicated their support for Carter, who as deputy defense secretary oversaw the massive Pentagon budget and its weapons procurement."

The Washington Post,L,Orion test flight scrubbed due to valve problems - The Washington Post," By Christian Davenport December 4 at 10:06 AM  Follow @_chrisdavenport        NASA officials delayed the scheduled launch of the Orion space capsule until Friday due to a last-minute technical problem. (Reuters)   The historic launch of Orion, NASA’s much-heralded, next-generation spacecraft, was scrubbed Thursday because of faulty valves. The decision came after repeated delays caused by strong winds and even an errant boat that appeared to move too close to the launch site. Up until the final minutes before the close of the launch window, NASA officials held out hopes of testing the craft designed to ultimately bring humans to Mars. But after a tense morning, several fuel and drain valves that did not function properly finally forced officials to postpone the mission. The next launch window is Friday at 7:05 a.m. EST. But officials said there was only a ""40 percent chance of favorable weather conditions"" for a launch Friday morning. The uncrewed spacecraft had been scheduled to lift off at 7:05 a.m.Thursday  from Cape Canaveral, Fla., aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket, en route to a 4.5 hour flight that would take it twice around Earth and to an altitude of 3,600 miles-- farther than any spacecraft designed for humans has traveled in more than 40 years. As the morning unfolded, a NASA official had said on the agency's live web stream that there have been a ""number of minor issues,"" but no ""show stoppers."" At one point, the official said Orion ""stands ready for launch"" as crews waited for the wind to die down. In a statement, the United Launch Alliance, the joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that makes the Delta IV rocket, said that while ""the liquid hydrogen fill and drain valves...did not properly close within the allotted time,"" the spacecraft ""has no technical or operational issues and remains ready for launch."" Daniel Collins, ULA's chief operating officer, told reporters Thursday afternoon that the valves ""had gotten cold and a little sluggish in their performance."" He said that the team was ""listening to everything the rocket was telling us. And it told us it wasn't ready to go today. So we'll go make sure we have a happy rocket. And as soon as we do that we're going to get back to the pad and send Orion off for a very successful test flight.""            1 of 6       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                       Skip Ad   ×           Awaiting the launch of Orion spacecraft    View Photos   The test flight of NASA’s next-generation spacecraft was repeatedly delayed and then canceled Thursday.

Speaking on NASA TV Thursday morning, he said that ""Mars is the ultimately goal for this generation."" The Orion does not have any people on board. That's not expected to happen for another seven or eight years. But the test flight will go a long way to eventually getting humans further than they've every gone before, NASA officials say. One of the key tests will be Orion's heat shield, which will face temperatures of 4,000 degrees when the capsule barrels into the atmosphere at 20,000 mph. Officials from NASA and Lockheed Martin, the massive Bethesda-based contractor that built Orion, will also be watching to see how it performs the various ""separating events,"" and how it handles the extreme radiation of deep space. Another key test will be the series of parachutes that deploy to slow Orion down before it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean, which is expected to occur four hours and 25 minutes after takeoff. Mark Geyer, NASA's Orion Program Manager, said that flying the Orion without a crew would allow NASA to test the most risky systems: ""We intend to stress the systems and make sure they behave as we designed them to.” The last time a spacecraft designed for human travel left Low Earth Orbit was the 1972 Apollo 17 mission, also the last time astronauts walked on the moon. Since then, human flights have been restricted to Low Earth Orbit, home to the International Space Station. But Thursday's flight will go 15 times as far. Sometime in the 2020s, NASA plans to capture an asteroid with a robotic spacecraft, then drag it to the moon’s orbit where it would connect with the Orion. Astronauts would then be able to take samples from the asteroid. The big target, however, remains Mars. And Thursday’s test flight will help “put Mars within the reach of astronauts in the 2030s,” NASA says. While the Orion was initially part of a program, called Constellation, designed to return to moon, its mission changed after the Obama administration killed Constellation and made Mars the goal. Thursday's mission would have used a Delta IV Heavy rocket, made by United launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But future Orion missions would use the new Space Launch System rocket, which is still being developed. Bolden has called testing Orion ""a continuation of what Apollo started."" ""We've taken a 40-year hiatus,"" he said. ""And now we're back on track.""  "
The Washington Post,L,"White House, Democrats teaming up on ‘Immigration Strike Team’ - The Washington Post"," By Ed O'Keefe December 4 at 8:12 AM  Follow @edatpost        Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), center, stands with Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) in the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 27, 2013. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  The White House and congressional Democrats are teaming up to form an ""Immigration Strike Team"" to serve as a better-organized rapid response force to counter whatever Republicans do or say about immigration reform in the coming months. The goal, according to several congressional aides familiar with the plans, is to ensure that lawmakers and administration officials are more closely coordinating talking points and media appearances and using all outlets at their disposal to highlight incendiary comments or controversial legislation introduced by Republicans. The move comes as the GOP scrambles to avoid another government shutdown while also finding a way to respond to President Obama's decision to change the nation's immigration policy through executive action. Some Republicans have proposed stripping Obama's executive authority; withholding funds for federal agencies that enforce immigration laws; or ending the president's temporary protection for thousands of children of illegal immigrants. The new strike team project will be bilingual, ensuring that Democrats continue to use their connections to Spanish-media outlets like Univision, Telemundo and popular radio stations in several states to spread their message, said several aides who were familiar with the plans but weren't authorized to speak publicly about them. The White House and senior Democrats have closely coordinated over the past two years of the immigration debate, but the new plan is bringing in some junior members. It comes as many congressional Democrats blame Obama for the party's large midterm election losses. In response, the White House has stepped out its outreach to members through phone calls, in-person meetings -- even doling out seats on Air Force One as chits to build good will. On Wednesday, aides for several House Democrats were invited via e-mail to join what aides to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called an ""Immigration Strike Team."" The message was sent to dozens of spokespeople for several prominent members of the caucus, including members close to Pelosi like Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.); the heads of the Congressional Asian, Black and Hispanic caucuses; a handful of moderate, business-focused ""New Democrats;"" and some with a large following on social media or on Spanish-language television, including Reps. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.). The e-mail address of at least one White House spokeswoman was copied to the message. There's no guarantee that everyone invited to join will consent to do so, aides said. In the Senate, Democratic members of the ""Gang of Eight"" that wrote the bipartisan immigration bill passed last year will be part of the team, according to aides, along with Democrats from states with large Hispanic populations. That group includes Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), plus Sens. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Ultimately, the ""strike team"" hopes to better amplify instances like Durbin and Feinstein's appearances on Sunday morning television talk shows and social media -- or Kaine, who is bilingual, posts of support in English and Spanish. The first formal strike team conference call took place Wednesday afternoon. ""It was very much a 'this is a new group, we'll work together in the coming weeks'"" kind of call, said one aide. Such calls will continue for the foreseeable future. Up first: The group plans to build interest and attention for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for next week that will explore what Democrats believe are the benefits of Obama's decision to take executive action.

The Washington Post,L,New York Mayor Bill de Blasio pens an open letter after the Eric Garner decision: ‘There is much more to be done.’ - The Washington Post," By Abby Phillip December 4 at 2:32 PM  Follow @abbydphillip        New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that those angry with the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer in the death Eric Garner should work for positive change. (Reuters)   In an open letter one day after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called for peaceful protests and pledged to work toward repairing the relationship between police and the community. It was the mayor’s second response to the public outcry following the grand jury’s decision. The first came Wednesday night de Blasio (D) invoked his 17-year-old son, Dante, who is African American. “I’ve had to worry over the years… is Dante safe each night?” de Blasio said at a news conference, hours after the decision was announced. “Is my child safe, and not just from some of the painful realities of crime and violence in some of our neighborhoods, but safe from the very people they want to have faith in as their protectors? That’s the reality.” It was a tough stance for a city mayor to take in response to a case involving his own police force. And the law enforcement community, which viewed his comments as something of a betrayal,  responded with anger. “Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,” Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said at a news conference Thursday. But de Blasio’s willingness to publicly sympathize with Garner’s grieving family and angry protesters is partly explained by the fact that he was speaking from his experience as the father of two black children and as a progressive Democratic mayor, the first elected in New York in nearly 25 years. On Thursday, after a night of protests across the city, de Blasio released an open letter highlighting some of the changes that have already been put in place, some prior to the Garner case. He spoke more about reforms at a press conference on Thursday afternoon. RELATED: New York Mayor, police union officials clash after grand jury decision in Eric Garner’s death Here’s the full text of de Blasio’s open letter: Eric Garner’s death was a terrible tragedy that no family should have to endure. For many across our city and our nation, yesterday’s grand jury ruling compounds feelings of grief with dissatisfaction and anger.As we reflect on the weeks leading up to yesterday’s decision and prepare our path forward, I want to share a snapshot of our short- and long-term plans to improve the relationship between police and the communities they serve. First, this is not the end of the story — only the end of a chapter. The NYPD and the Justice Department will initiate their own investigations. Second, New York City owns a proud and powerful tradition of expression through non-violent protest. Demonstrations and free speech are valuable contributions to debate, but violence and disorder are not only wrong — they are counterproductive. Frustration is understandable. Centuries of racism precede us. But working together, we can turn from that history and make a profound and lasting change in the culture of law enforcement and bring police and community closer together. We’ve already begun to make progress. We’ve dramatically reduced the overuse and abuse of stop-and-frisk, initiated a comprehensive plan to retrain the entire NYPD to reduce the use of excessive force and to work with the community, reduced arrests for minor marijuana possession, and given officers body cameras to improve transparency and accountability. And we know there is much more to be done. Finally, in recent weeks, protesters and activists have adopted a phrase that should never have to be said, but that the stains on our country’s history demand we say: Black Lives Matter. When invoking this refrain, we must be mindful that issues surrounding policing and civil rights are not just an issue for people of color, they’re not just a problem for young people, and they’re not just a problem for people who get stopped by police. They’re a problem for all Americans who care about justice. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Together, we must work to make this right, to work for justice, and to build the kind of city and the kind of country we need to be. And we will. Thank you, Bill de Blasio Mayor"
The Washington Post,L,"DARRIN BELL: From Ferguson to New York cases, ‘Candorville’ cartoonist draws deeply from the personal [Q&A] - The Washington Post"," By Michael Cavna December 4 at 10:32 AM  Follow @comicriffs      Political cartoons by DARRIN BELL (courtesy of the artist/WPWG)    FOR DARRIN BELL, the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and Tamir Rice at the hands of police strike a personal chord. When he draws cartoons about such tragic incidents, he remembers “the talk” he once had with his mother — and anticipates “the talk” he will one day need to have with his own son. “My mother, who’s white, had ‘the talk’ with me when I was around 6 or 7,” Bell, a political cartoonist and creator of the strip “Candorville,” tells The Post’s Comic Riffs. “She was terrified because she’d caught me playing with a water gun another kid had loaned me. It looked like a real gun. She told me I’m a lot more likely to be shot by police than my friend was if they saw me with it, because police tend to think little black boys — even light-skinned ones — are older than they really are, and less innocent than they really are. “We have studies now that prove this,” Bell continues, “but at the time, that was her perception, growing up as she did in the ’50s and ’60s, I thought she was living in the past.” As Bell reads about, and editorially responds to, the recent high-profile killings of black males by officers, he is reminded that more than one cycle continues. “It’s personal because I’m going to have to have that talk with my baby boy in about seven or eight years, about how to behave when police are around, so as not to provoke them … ,” the Southern California-based cartoonist says, “and that’s the kind of talk a parent should only have to have with his child with regard to pitbulls.” Comic Riffs caught up with Bell (author of the Trayvon Martin-alluding “Does the Afterlife Have Skittles?”) to talk about his personal experiences and professional responses in the wake of the latest no-indictment decision involving a white officer and a black man turned fatality: MICHAEL CAVNA: You’re so adept at turning around editorial ideas, and art, quickly. Could you walk us through how you approached thus cartoon once you heard [Wednesday's] Eric Garner/NYPD no-indictment news? DARRIN BELL: There was so much I wanted to say. So many points I wanted to make. I wanted to comment on the difference between how authorities arrest white-collar criminals and the average suspect — especially when that suspect is an average minority. I wanted to address how body cameras will be useless if even a high-quality video of a senseless killing by police doesn’t sway a jury. I wanted to compare it to Ferguson and say it doesn’t matter whether a large, unarmed black man is moving toward the cop — as [Officer Darren] Wilson alleged Brown did — or moving away from the officer, as Garner clearly did in the video. The officer just might see him as a mortal threat either way. I wanted to follow up on the Ferguson grand jury cartoon [I drew] by showing that graffiti being etched in stone, because it’s possible the Ferguson ruling set a precedent — raised the bar significantly from discovering probable cause to discovering guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It’s not a trend yet — three would make a trend — but these two rulings at first glance seem to encroach on the duties of trial juries. I wanted to comment on how far we wouldn’t have to travel along the jackboot spectrum to cover the distance between “unaccountable law enforcement” and “police state.” I wanted to comment on all that. But whenever I have several competing ideas I want to get across, that tells me my ideas are just planets orbiting a star, and it’s really the star I should be commenting on. That’s when it’s time to (at the risk of mixing metaphors) put it all in a crucible and burn away everything until I’m left with the common denominator. That’s how I arrived at this cartoon.         MC:  Your new cartoon of course also speaks to Ferguson. You had a verbally spun Ferguson cartoon the other day [above]. Do you find yourself having a sad and unfortunate wealth of ideas lately on this issue? DB: I do, and it’s one of those times when I really, really hope I won’t have a chance to make use of any of my ideas. But then people keep giving me more chances. MC:  Sometimes I draw editorial cartoons from the head, sometimes from the heart — some are methodical, some are emotional — depending on my connection to the material. How personal, or not, are these Ferguson and NYPD cartoons to you as subject matter? DB: They’re personal, because every time police brutality and police killings of unarmed black men make it into the news, the reaction is the same: Some people reflexively argue that the guy must’ve had it coming. Raising your arm to deflect the blow of a baton becomes an “aggressive movement.” A screwdriver in your backpack becomes a “burglary tool.” Everything you’ve ever done wrong — including ever having been suspended from school — is dug up and becomes proof, in some quarters, that you were a scumbag — a rabid animal who needed to be put down. It’s personal because I know that if I were ever to be killed by police, I would receive the same treatment. Even though I’m the kind of guy who smiles, says, “Yes, officer,” makes no sudden movements, gives them whatever documents they ask for and keeps his hands in plain view at all times. … If one of them shot me, plenty of people would assume I provoked it somehow. And the cop would almost certainly not be held accountable. It’s personal because I’m going to have to have that talk with my baby boy in about seven or eight years about how to behave when police are around, so as not to provoke them. And that’s the kind of talk a parent should only have to have with his child with regard to pitbulls. MC: You lived in the L.A. during the Rodney King verdict, and your [late] granddad might have spoken [to you about] the area’s Watts Riots. In what sort of historical context do you put recent riots over police actions and justice in relation to those key times in L.A. history?  DB: Riots are insane. But the thing is, when you know there’s a historical pattern of this sort of thing happening — when you see it happen again and again before your eyes and so many people not only don’t care, but blame the victim — and you know that tomorrow it can be you or your child that it happens to, and that the ones who do it can do it with impunity, that drives you a little crazy. Rioting is wrong. Rioting is self-defeating, and far less effective than sustained, nonviolent protest. But it’s also a natural reaction to being abused by authorities and having nowhere to turn for justice. America has a LONG history of rioting, by white people as well as black. The LA Riots were one of those spontaneous eruptions of frustration and rage, and then opportunists swooped in to take advantage of the situation and “get free stuff.” That happened in Ferguson too. Every uprising has that: people who are genuinely outraged and flailing in blind rage at the status quo because they can’t take any more … and leeches who come along for the ride. That’s not unique to riots — that’s human nature. In politics, you’ve got statesmen trying to govern, and crooks trying to score. In business, you’ve got people trying to build a fortune and build up the country, and along for the ride are people trying to build their fortune by stealing what little other people have. In war, you’ve got soldiers trying to win and live, and you’ve got those who’re out to pillage and loot. And in policing, you’ve got the majority who are trying to serve and protect, and then along for the ride are those who abuse, steal — sorry, “confiscate” — and murder. Rioters aren’t the only ones who take advantage. They’re not even the most common.    “CANDORVILLE” (2012 courtesy of Darrin Bell/WPWG)  MC: You created an especially memorable “Candorville” week of Trayvon’s post-life train ride. Do you have any plans to handle these two police deaths from the summer, and the no-indictments, in future strips?  DB: Yes, but not those two in particular, because those two aren’t isolated incidents. MC: What do you hope to most communicate to your readers about the state of things on this issue, as a commentator — if not also as a citizen and father? DB: The reason those incidents in particular — and all the incidents that happened in this long, hot summer and fall — provoked such frustration and anger is, they’re representative of what happens regularly in this country. It happens to white people, too, but white people tend to trust the police more than black people do, so they assume in those cases that it was either justified, or an awful mistake that was nobody’s fault. When the Arizona police executed that homeless man who was trying to gather his belongings and leave, as they’d told him to, I expected outrage, and I was ready to comment on it. But America paid attention for a few hours and then shrugged its collective shoulders and forgot about it. Outrage only happens when you notice that abuse of power — which encompasses an entire spectrum from unfair traffic stops, to “confiscation” of valuables and cash without cause, to cops in your neighborhood thinking they have a right to poke their heads out of their windows and demand to know where you’re going, to brutality and finally killing — happens regularly. Outrage happens when you realize that “isolated incident” and “happens regularly” are mutually exclusive concepts. Most police, from what I can tell, are honorable and genuinely trying to just do their job, help people and make it home at the end of the day. But the problem is, they protect their own. They’re comfortable being part of a system that protects the bad apples among them from accountability. They don’t “snitch.” That’s why plenty of people who’ve grown up around gangs view the police as just another — better-armed — gang. But it’s wrong to stereotype cops, to profile them all based on the actions of just a few. Just as it’s wrong to profile people like Eric Garner, to consider a black man to be potentially a violent threat you have to erase just because he’s large and has sold untaxed cigarettes in the past. MC: Anything you’d like to add, from opinions to [personal] anecdotes? DB: This is something I never told my mother, because I was certain she’d never let me go play outside alone again. In light of all that’s happened, I think it’s relevant here: My mother, who’s white, had “the talk” with me when I was around 6 or 7. She was terrified because she’d caught me playing with a water gun another kid had loaned me. It looked like a real gun. She told me I’m a lot more likely to be shot by police than my friend was if they saw me with it, because police tend to think little black boys — even light-skinned ones — are older than they really are, and less innocent than they really are. We have studies now that prove this, but at the time, that was her perception, growing up as she did in the ’50s and ’60s. I thought she was living in the past. And I resented what happened next: She took me to the corner store and bought me a bright-green, transparent plastic water gun. It was humiliating. But she said it would keep me alive, because the police would never mistake it for a real gun. A few weeks later, I walked by myself to the pizza parlor around the corner to play some video games. Along the way, I decided I was Han Solo and I kept “shooting” the bushes, the fire hydrant — and every other inanimate object I could pretend was a Stormtrooper — with my water gun. The only time I stopped shooting was when I knelt down by the side of the road to reload my bright-green, transparent gun in a puddle. I don’t recall the sound of the voice that said “PUT IT DOWN,” but I still remember the officer’s sunglasses, his tie clip, and his hand on his unholstered weapon. I remember standing and freezing. I remember it seemed like it took forever before he holstered his weapon and walked toward me. I remember him saying something about “complaints,” asking me where I was going, asking me over and over where I lived and what I was doing here. I remember him taking away my bright-green, transparent water gun, saying something else to me, and leaving. I remember running home; and I remember wanting to thank my mom for taking away that realistic gun, but instead going straight to my room because I didn’t want her to decide I could never leave home alone again. All I’ll say is this: My 1-year-old boy is never going to even touch a toy gun.

The Washington Post,L,Capitals at Hurricanes: Game 25 discussion thread - The Washington Post," By Alex Prewitt December 4 at 6:55 PM  Follow @alex_prewitt      Capitals defenseman John Carlson notched the first two-goal game of his career Tuesday against Vancouver (AP Photo/Alex Brandon).  RALEIGH, N.C. — Bludgeoned on the penalty kill twice in two games, the Washington Capitals (10-10-4, 24 points) hit the road trying to solve their inconsistencies before the calendar year closes. Nine of their next 12 games come away from Verizon Center, starting Thursday night here at PNC Arena against the Carolina Hurricanes (8-13-3, 19 points). These two teams already met Nov. 8, when Nicklas Backstrom’s overtime goal helped the Capitals overcome a third-period collapse, when their 3-1 lead disappeared. Plenty happened for Washington in the almost four weeks since, but Coach Barry Trotz’s team hasn’t stopped hovering around .500 and fourth place in the Metropolitan Division. Now, the Capitals shipped south hoping to break a two-game losing streak, during which they allowed six power play goals and 10 total. “Our penalty kill hasn’t been that bad, but it goes in times during the year,” Coach Barry Trotz said. “When you get lit up, you get lit up a lot. When you’re able to stop teams, you stop them a lot. We’ve gone through a patch here that’s been pretty messy for us on that end.” They have dealt with messy situations before, like an early-season affinity for costly defensive zone turnovers, or a string of goaltending miscues against the Devils and Blues, or even-strength scoring droughts, each loss seeming to pivot on one glaring issue. This week, as the Capitals packed for Carolina and New Jersey, a certain urgency emerged in the locker room. Time is far from running out, but with an already sizable gap formed between the Islanders and Penguins and the rest of the Metropolitan Division, the Capitals know this month could prove vital. “Too many times where we only have half, three quarters of the guys going,” defenseman Karl Alzner said. “You can’t win like that. You need everybody to go every game. That’s up to each of us to figure out on our own. I know I’ve had some off nights and I go right back to the drawing board. You try to make it better. That’s all we can really do. We have great systems, we have the right coaching, we have all those things in place. It’s us who falters too often.” In meeting with reporters Thursday, Trotz said he would rejigger his bottom six, so the lines listed below might look different once pregame rushes take place. Otherwise, the goaltending matchup, injuries and links hold up. The Capitals fly to New Jersey and practice Friday in Newark at 2:30 p.m. Thanks for following along.

The Capitals handcuffed Holtby on Tuesday against Vancouver with several penalties, so Trotz found little fault there. Still, Holtby has allowed seven total goals over his past two appearances, but is 5-3-0 lifetime against the Hurricanes with a .940 save percentage and 2.23 goals against average. Khudobin, replacing the injured Cam Ward, has not recorded a win this season. He allowed four goals on Nov. 8 in Washington, but since then held the San Jose Sharks to one goal and the Pittsburgh Penguins to three. In his career, Khudobin is 3-1-1 against the Capitals (.910 SV%, 2.94 GAA).

The Washington Post,L,Manila Mart in Beltsville caters to Pinoys and American fanboys alike - The Washington Post," By Tim Carman December 4 at 4:27 PM  Follow @timcarman    Non-Pinoys aren’t so fond of pancit palabok, the woman at Manila Mart told me as she prepared a fresh batch of the Filipino comfort food. They tend to recoil, like vampires, from all the garlic, she said.  Okay, she didn’t drop the vampire reference, but she did emphasize the dish also includes smoked fish flakes called tinapa, which non-natives apparently fear more than death, clowns and Guy Fieri’s donkey sauce. Well, she didn’t say anything about circus performers or equine-named gravies, either, but she did offer to prepare a sample, so I wouldn’t waste my money and, by extension, her labors.    Pancit palabok, a pungent noodle dish with egg, shrimp, garlic and pork rinds served at Manila Mart. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  What she handed me was not a tiny Dixie-cup sample, but a decent-sized Styrofoam bowl that would have sold for $15 on 14th Street NW. Manila Mart’s pancit palabok starts with a tangle of rice noodles coated in a shrimp sauce, garnished with slices of hard-boiled egg, curls of cooked shrimp, scallions and a breadcrumb-like crust of tinapa, crushed pork rinds and fried garlic crumbles. The richness, the funk, the crunch, the pungency, the fishiness: Your palate won’t know which way to turn. To prove that non-Pinoys can be fanboys of pancit palabok, I walked back to the prep area to show the employee my Styrofoam bowl, all but licked clean. “So you like it?” she asked. Not only do I like it, but pancit palabok has become the new romance in my life. Filipino food is enjoying a moment in Washington. It’s been dragged from the shadows by such chefs as Katsuya Fukushima (whose izakaya brunch at Daikaya includes a sisig pork hash) and Cathal Armstrong (who features refined Pinoy dishes at Restaurant Eve as a nod to his Filipino-American wife and partner, Meshelle), as well as restaurateurs Nick Pimentel and Genevieve Villamora (whose recent Bad Saint pop-up had a  line of people waiting to try it).    Customers gather around Emma and Antonio Bioc's Filipino food at Manila Mart in Beltsville. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  But for every chef-driven Filipino plate, there must be three home-style Pinoy restaurants laboring in some suburban black hole without media scrutiny and the instant hipster cachet such attention generates. Take, for example, Manila Mart, which is crammed into a strip-center storefront in Beltsville with security bars covering its windows. The facade all but screams: Eat pavement and go elsewhere. Don’t be fooled: Owned by Filipino natives Antonio and Emma Bioc, Manila Mart may lack atmosphere, but it radiates kindness. Their cafe, with its small clutch of tables, sits in back of the market. From Wednesday through Sunday, the Biocs and team prepare a rotating menu of Filipino favorites, some of which are not displayed on the steam table where all business is conducted. Emma and/or her daughter, Kate Magno, will happily explain every dish available that day, providing samples as needed to sate your curiosity, if not your appetite.    The steam table at Manila Mart in Beltsville. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  It’s easy to understand why chefs have latched onto umami-rich Filipino cuisine. Its cooking borrows from cultures near and far, from China to Mexico, and its blunt flavors are as subtle as Imelda Marcos’s shoe closet. Besides, Filipinos love pork more than David Chang and Sean Brock on a weekend bender in North Carolina. Start with Manila Mart’s pork skewers, which are marinated and grilled, the char darting in and around the sweet-soy flavors. The meat’s tenderness is derived from the same source as its sweetness: the Sprite in the marinade.    Barbecued pork skewers at Manila Mart in Beltsville. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  The skewers are available every day the cafe is open for business. Same for some other plates, including lechon kawali, a slab of boiled-and-fried pork belly, which sounds like a State Fair dare until you bite into it. The crackly exterior quickly gives way to a lush, fatty interior, as yielding as corn pudding. You will eat more than any doctor would advise. The simmered pork in the dinuguan may be an acquired taste: Known as “chocolate meat,” because of the pork’s cocoa-liquor-like sauce, the dish assaults the nostrils with its barnyard aromas and then moves to the palate with its minerally and sour flavors. Dinuguan owes its funkiness to such hardcore ingredients as pig’s blood and palm vinegar.    Dinuguan, a traditional Filipino stew made with pig’s blood and palm vinegar. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  Filipino cuisine, of course, is not an immutable, impermeable object, identical on every one of the 7,107 islands in the archipelago. Emma Bioc, for example, hails from the Bulacan province, famous for its sweets (some of which, such as puto, these tiny muffin-poppers split at the top and exploding with cheddar cheese, can be found pre-packaged on the counter). But she ventures into other areas, such as Bicol, a major Filipino coconut-producing region and the spiritual home of Bicol express, a stew of semi-spicy pork simmered in coconut milk. In Bioc’s hands, the dish expertly balances sweet with heat.  The sheer diversity of dishes at Manila Mart is jaw-dropping for such a small operation. The signature sourness in the tender beef steak, or bistek as it’s known in the Philippines, may taste like lemon juice, but it’s actually the liquid from the Filipino counterpart, this tart little orb called calamansi. The bone-in oxtail in the kare-kare luxuriates in a peanut sauce enriched with the drippings from that long-braised meat. The dense collardlike taro leaves in the house-made laing dish, another Bicol specialty, add a bitter, earthy element to the coconut milk infused with shrimp paste. And the slices of bitter melon in the ginisang ampalaya are no joke: They’d curl the tongue of an amari-aholic.     Kare-kare, a dish of beef oxtail in a peanut stew, served at Manila Mart in Beltsville. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  But no matter what you order, here’s the thing to remember about Manila Mart: The Biocs want to ease you into Filipino cooking. So they dial down the pungent and pepper qualities that may make non-Pinoys nervous, allowing diners to customize their meal at the table. It may be a courtesy to American customers, but it doesn’t taste like a cheat to Filipino cooking.  MANILA MART 5023 Garrett Ave., Beltsville. 301-931-0086.   Hours: Wednesday-Saturday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Nearest Metro station: Greenbelt, with a four-mile trip to the restaurant.  Prices: $5.50-$12.99.   "
The Washington Post,L,The rules of engagement: How militarized police units enforce the law around the world - The Washington Post," By Nicole Crowder December 4 at 11:00 AM  Follow @nicolemcrowder      Members of Belgium’s special forces at their headquarters in central Brussels. (Yves Herman/Reuters)  In 1993 the Justice Department installed the 1033 program as a way to help law enforcement agencies counter drug activities during the United States’ “war on drugs.”  In 1997, the boundaries of law enforcement expanded after Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, granting police and other agencies the right to obtain weaponry for specific law enforcement purposes that would help in making arrests. Many U.S. police departments have since acquired surplus U.S. military hardware: armored vehicles, military-grade weaponry. According to Reuters, since 1996 the Defense Department has transferred $4.3 billion in military equipment to local and state police through the 1033 program. And after 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security allowed local law enforcement to inherit a surplus of military weaponry from wars abroad through federal funds to counter terrorism. The recent clashes between heavily armed law enforcement and protesters in the wake of a police officer killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., have reignited the discussion surrounding the militarization of American police forces. The rules of engagement for police or paramilitary forces abroad allows the use of lethal force using military-grade gear with relatively few restrictions. But with that is a code of conduct, a set of rules, that sharply regulates the wide latitude of law enforcement, and puts into a place a system of accountability. Human rights monitors say police in Belgium are legally entitled to use proportionate force, after a warning, where there is no other means to achieve a legitimate objective. Police may use firearms in self-defense, to confront armed perpetrators, or in defense of persons or key facilities, but never for crowd control. In Afghanistan, “the police can use weapons or explosives against a group of people only if they it has … disturbed security by means of arms, and if the use of other means of force … has proved ineffective.” And Afghan police are required to give no fewer than six warnings – three verbal and three warning shots – before using force in this situation. In India, the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are called on for violent disorder that the police are unable to contain. They require an on-the-spot magistrate’s consent and must issue a warning before each escalation of the use of force, from verbal warning to water cannon and tear gas, then to rubber bullets or baton rounds, and then to firearms. Britain’s law states that “lethal or potentially lethal force should only be used when absolutely necessary in self-defense, or in the defense of others against the threat of death or serious injury.” In Italy, police and the paramilitary Carabinieri follow the same guidelines, which say that the use of weapons is allowed only in the line of duty, when it is an “unavoidable necessity to overcome resistance, stop violence or prevent a [serious] crime,” and that the response must be proportionate to the situation.

The Washington Post,L,Why Apple’s in court over iPod software it stopped using in 2009 - The Washington Post," By Hayley Tsukayama December 4 at 10:59 AM  Follow @htsuka      Two iPod players circa 2009, when Apple stopped putting rights technology limitations on music. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)  Apple is embroiled in another trial this week, with lawyers spending time in a California courtroom debating whether or not the company was acting in an anticompetitive manner toward music player competitors such as RealNetworks between 2007 and 2009. Here's a primer on the basics of this case and what's at stake. It deals with allegedly anticompetitive behavior on the iPod. The case deals specifically with the way that Apple handled files on the iPod between 2006 and 2009. It's hard to overstate the impact that the success of the iPod had on Apple -- and the strategy that it set for every product the company has released since. The iPod represented the first time that Apple successfully linked hardware and software together by tying the iPod to the iTunes store. The iPod certainly wasn't the first MP3 player, but it did end up being the most successful in large part because it was hooked into a store that Apple completely controlled. For many years, users couldn't play songs they'd purchased on other music services on the iPod, and also couldn't play their Apple-purchased music on any non-iPod player. That's the technology being discussed here, though there have been no digital rights management limitations on Apple's music since 2009. But the case has been wending its way through the courts for a decade, and was finally given the go-ahead for trial earlier this year, as the San Jose Mercury News reported. Lawyers say Apple was crazed in its pursuit of market share. The latest accusation lobbed against Apple claims that the company actively erased music purchased from other sites when people updated their iPods. Lawyers arguing against Apple have pointed to this as evidence that Apple was determined to keep iPod users hooked only on its own service, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. That would also keep them coming back to the iPod when it was time to upgrade, since all of the music was locked to Apple's device. According to the Journal's report, attorney Patrick Coughlin said Apple decided to give users' ""the worst possible experience and blow up"" their music libraries in an effort to protect the contracts that Apple worked out with music labels to get music into the iTunes store.  Apple says it was just really worried about hacking. Apple has said that the reason that it scrubbed competitors' music off of the iPod was for security. Apple attorney William Isaacson said that hackers had been trying to put files on the iPod that would help them figure out how to hack the system. Allowing software from RealNetworks and other competitors ""posed a danger to the consumer experience and to the quality of the product,"" Isaacson told the court, according to a report from Reuters. But company officials did say that they purposefully did not tell users that their non-iTunes music was disappearing. As the Journal reported, Apple security director Augustin Farrugia testified that Apple didn't want to ""give users too much information"" on how the software worked -- ostensibly to avoid user confusion. And videotaped testimony from 2011 starring Apple's late co-founder, Steve Jobs, does show that the executive wasn't afraid to play hardball with competitors. In the deposition, Reuters reported, Jobs asked if RealNetworks even still existed,  in response to an opening question about whether he was familiar with the company. (They did then, and still do.) And, when asked if Apple's statement about RealNetworks's software sounded ""angry"" -- including a draft of a press release that likened the company's software to hacking -- Jobs said that a ""strong response from Apple would be a lawsuit."" There's a lot of money at stake... The class action is asking for $350 million in damages for a class of around 8 million people. If Apple loses the case, customers who bought iPods between Sept. 12, 2006, and March 31, 2009, may be eligible for a small payment. That's a lot of cash -- though maybe not quite as much for Apple, which made $8.5 billion in profits last quarter alone. Still, making big settlements is probably not a habit Apple would like to get into. The company has already agreed to pay up to $450 million to settle a class action over e-book pricing. Half a billion here, half a billion there, and those settlements can add up. ...but it's unlikely to change much, if anything, about Apple's current business. For one, even if a judge does find against Apple in this particular trial, the company has shown in the past that it's not at all hesitant about filing appeals. After all, Apple was found liable in a 2013 Justice Department suit for colluding with publishers to raise the price of e-books in 2013 -- a case the company has appealed and has said it will take all the way up to the Supreme Court, if it has to. And, apart from the fact that the technology in question here was phased out in 2009, it's also a fact that the iPod is much less important to Apple's overall business than it used be. In its latest earnings call, the company disclosed that sales were down 28 percent from the same period last year. Apple has also decided to report iPod sales in a category with Apple TV, accessory and Apple Watch sales from now on; the music players used to have their own category on the balance sheet."
The Washington Post,L,Investigation: Afghan shooter ambushed slain Army general at close range - The Washington Post," By Dan Lamothe December 4 at 9:15 AM  Follow @danlamothe      Then-Brig. Gen. Harold Greene addresses a crowd in 2011. He was killed in a shooting in Afghanistan on Aug. 5. (U.S. Army photo)  The mass shooting that killed a two-star Army general and wounded 18 other people in Afghanistan on Aug. 5 was carried out by a lone Afghan soldier who did not have any apparent ties to the Taliban and who simply seized “a target of opportunity,” according to a U.S. military investigation.    This photo of Rafiqullah, 22, is included in a U.S. Central Command report released Thursday. He opened fire on coalition and Afghan troops in Afghanistan, killing Army Maj. Gen. Harold Greene. (Photo released by the U.S. military)  The investigation, released by U.S. Central Command on Thursday, found that Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, of Falls Church, Va., died immediately after being shot multiple times in the pelvis, head and neck by an army private named Rafiqullah, 22, who also was killed in the incident. The report found that Rafiqullah opened fire from a bathroom window in a military police barracks less than 15 meters away from the nearest person he targeted. He had previously expressed disdain for Americans. Greene was the highest-ranking U.S. officer killed in a combat zone since the Vietnam War. The others wounded in the shooting included German Army Brig. Gen. Michael Bartscher and Afghan Brig. Gen. Miyan-Yar Gulalm Sahki. The names of the others wounded are redacted from the newly released documents, but they include 10 Americans, three Afghans and two individuals from Britain. The attack occurred at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University. The facility, in the Qarga district of Kabul province and west of the city, was known as the Afghan National Defense University until this year. Greene, the deputy commanding general of Combined Security Command – Afghanistan, and the others were at the academy to review and discuss a construction project that was underway and highlight the school’s potential to train Afghan officers. The report said that Rafiqullah was not believed to have been a member of the Taliban or any other extremist group. He may have been “self-radicalized” or had a mental illness, investigators found. He fired between 27 to 30 rounds from an M-16 that carried up to 30 in its magazine, and was killed by coalition service members. It “appears the shooting was not premeditated, and the shooter simply took advantage of a target of opportunity provided by the close gathering,” according to the investigation report, completed by Army Brig. Gen. Donald E. Jackson Jr. An Afghan interpreter for a contractor at the academy told investigators that Rafiqullah had expressed dislike for Americans before. The shooter had previously challenged the interpreter on why he worked for Americans, and the interpreter responded that in doing so, he also was helping the Afghan National Army. The answer seemed to satisfy Rafiqullah, the interpreter recalled. The shooter also had grievances with his own Afghan military commanders. He had been denied time off recently, and was frustrated after working a double shift recently while other Afghan soldiers relaxed, Afghan troops said. Some Afghan soldiers expressed surprise about his involvement in the attack, saying he was well liked in their unit. Photographs included in the report released Thursday underscore how close together the ambushed troops were when Rafiqullah began shooting. The photographs were likely available because the shooting occurred during a meeting of senior officers. This image released by CENTCOM shows he attack site afterward. Investigators labeled the window used by Rafiqullah with a red dot:    This photograph shows the site of the Aug. 5 mass shooting in Afghanistan that killed Maj. Gen. Harold Greene and wounded 18 others. (Photo released by U.S. Central Command)  This image, taken 10 minutes before the shooting, shows how close Americans and Afghans were standing at the training academy before the attack. Investigators labeled those who were later wounded with a red dot:    This image released by U.S. officials shows the scene of the Aug. 5 shooting in Afghanistan that killed Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, 10 minutes before it occurred. (U.S. Central Command photo)  The window the shooter used opened outward, limiting the angles at which he could shoot. This photograph released by U.S. officials shows it riddled with bullet holes after American troops returned fire and hit Rafiqullah:    The window Rafiqullah used to open fire on U.S., coalition and Afghan troops on Aug. 5. (Photo released by U.S. Central Command)  Coalition troops cleared the building that Rafiqullah used to make sure that there weren’t any other threats, and found him barely breathing while slumped in a bathroom shower stall. They checked him for explosives, and he died moments later, the investigation found. Some witnesses said they heard shots from within the bathroom after Rafiqullah’s attack, raising the question whether Afghan soldiers inside the building shot at him. Investigators could not determine who fired the fatal shots."
The Washington Post,L,Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly republishes atheist propaganda - The Washington Post," By Erik Wemple December 4 at 9:46 AM  Follow @ErikWemple    Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com This being December, Bill O’Reilly’s annual war on the “War on Christmas” is on. At first glance, O’Reilly’s campaign against atheists is bad for them: In front of an audience of millions, the host bashes their attempts to end governmental recognition of a religious celebration — Christmas, that is — as a federal holiday. He ridicules them. He has called them a “merry band of fascists.” In denouncing them, however, O’Reilly also promotes them. Last year around this time, the Erik Wemple Blog reported that donations to American Atheists Inc. spike after an appearance on “The O’Reilly Factor” or “Hannity.” And surely American Atheists were thrilled with Tuesday* night’s “War on Christmas” installment. For more than five minutes, O’Reilly criticized a campaign by American Atheists to place billboards in southern U.S. cities and Milwaukee. They showcase a child wearing a Santa hat and a message: “Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas is to skip church. I’m too old for fairy tales.” As he trashed the billboard, O’Reilly also showed the billboard. Three times, for a total of about 40 seconds. Helpful producers provided close-ups of the sign as well as wide views of the sign, just so the viewers could sample it from different angles. PR types know this as “earned media.” “I have no complaints there,” says Danielle Muscato, spokeswoman for American Atheists. “Part of the reason that we do these billboard campaigns the way we do them is for press attention as well as just for people driving by.” Muscato says that the group attempted to get a sign placed in Mississippi, but the billboard company declined to put it up because of its “content.” Perhaps the group last night got through to some Mississippi viewers of “The Factor.” *Correction: Original item stated that this segment took place last night. It was Tuesday night."
The Washington Post,L,President Obama’s unilateral action on immigration has no precedent - The Washington Post,"   U.S. President Barack Obama reacts to a protester as he speaks at the Copernicus Community Center on November 25, 2014 in Chicago, Illinois. Obama discussed the executive actions he is taking to address the country's immigration system. (John Gress/Getty Images)   By Editorial Board December 3   THE WHITE House has defended President Obama’s unilateral decision to legalize the presence of nearly 4 million undocumented immigrants as consistent, even in scope, with the executive actions of previous presidents. In fact, it is increasingly clear that the sweeping magnitude of Mr. Obama’s order is unprecedented. Central to the administration’s argument is its contention that the 4 million covered by the president’s order — some 36 percent of the estimated undocumented population of 11 million — is in line with the percentage covered by a comparable action by President George H.W. Bush in 1990. At that time, there were about 3.5 million illegal immigrants in the country; Mr. Obama, administration officials and their allies have said that about 1.5 million of them — the spouses and children of previously amnestied immigrants — benefited from Mr. Bush’s move.  In addition to the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, and Mr. Obama himself, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel cited the Bush executive action as precedent, using the figure of 1.5 million immigrants. However, as The Post’s Glenn Kessler has scrupulously reported , there is every reason to believe that the estimate is wildly exaggerated and based mainly on what appears to have been a misunderstanding at the time. When the measure was announced, Bush administration officials estimated the number who would be affected at around 100,000. While that was followed by some fuzziness and upward revisions, the actual number affected by the 1990 order was clearly a fraction — perhaps a couple of hundred thousand people, at most — of the 1.5 million that Obama administration officials have cited. Even the apparent original source of the 1.5 million figure — Gene McNary, who led the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the time — told Mr. Kessler he believes the number is false and was based on a misunderstanding from testimony he gave to Congress. And no underlying data or methodology to justify the 1.5 million figure has been uncovered. This is not a game of gotcha; facts matter — even in Washington — and so do the numbers. Under close scrutiny it is plain that the White House’s numbers are indefensible. It is similarly plain that the scale of Mr. Obama’s move goes far beyond anything his predecessors attempted. A responsible Congress would have legislated a fix to the nation’s broken immigration system. It is outrageous that Republican leaders in the House refused to allow a vote on a bill that passed the Senate last year. That bill, backed by Democrats and some moderate Republicans, stood a good chance of passing the House and becoming law. Even now, Republicans’ refusal to enact a bill — and their use of Mr. Obama’s order as further pretext for obstinacy and paralysis — is an abdication of leadership and duty.  Republicans’ failure to address immigration also does not justify Mr. Obama’s massive unilateral act. Unlike Mr. Bush in 1990, whose much more modest order was in step with legislation recently and subsequently enacted by Congress, Mr. Obama’s move flies in the face of  congressional intent — no matter how indefensible that intent looks.

When are reverse mortgages due? What triggers early withdrawal penalties? What exactly is covered by Medicare again?
Retirement planning is hard, and most people struggle to understand the fundamentals, according to a new report by the American College of Financial Services, a nonprofit that educates financial advisers. Only 20 percent of people in or near retirement who were surveyed by the group passed a quiz about the basics of retirement planning.
The group quizzed more than 1,000 people, ages 60 to 75, who had at least $100,000 in assets. The goal was to get a sense of how informed people are as they approach retirement, says Dave Littell, a director at The American College. “In some ways we expected people wouldn’t do that great on the test,” Littell says. “We were surprised at just how bad they did.”
People were most stumped by questions about the strategies that could help their money last longer in retirement. For instance, more people said they would get the biggest boost to their retirement income by saving more when they were close to retirement, but in reality pushing back retirement by a few years or delaying Social Security would have a bigger impact, Littell says. (Savings set aside at that stage don’t have as much time to benefit from investment growth, he says.)
Indeed, people often misunderstand the rules about drawing down their assets in retirement, says Gary Koenig, vice president of financial security for the AARP Public Policy Institute. People forget that they need to start taking required minimum distributions from their individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s after age 70 1/2, says Koenig, who was not involved in the study. Others don’t know that taking Social Security benefits at 62 leads to a permanent reduction in benefits, assuming incorrectly that they would start receiving full benefits once they reach full retirement age, he says.
Some of the 38 questions asked in the quiz were far from elementary, hitting on complicated retirement products like annuities. Some were more focused on investing topics like interest rate risk and mutual fund costs. (Do you know what a PE ratio is? Or what is the average lifetime payout for a 65-year-old male getting an immediate income annuity?) Some of the terminology may have tripped people up, Littell says. “Jargon is a challenge,” he says, adding that it can be tough to avoid such complicated terms.
But the confusion also highlighted another risk — people may be over confident about their retirement security. While most people struggled to answer the questions on retirement strategy,  more than half, or 55 percent, said they felt they were prepared to meet their income needs in retirement. Ninety-one percent said they were moderately confident they would have a secure retirement.
The quiz also highlighted one thing that people often get wrong that could increase their chances of running out of money in retirement — how long they are likely to live. Most people underestimate their longevity, putting them at risk of drawing down their savings too soon, collecting Social Security benefits too early and taking a lump-sum payment from a pension plan when they might be better off with an annuity, Koenig says.
