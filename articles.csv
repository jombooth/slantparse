The American Conservative,C,What Not to Do on Iran | The American Conservative,"Michael Makovsky and Bill Kristol have some typically awful proposals for Iran policy:
Congress could immediately pass new and stronger sanctions legislation, which would seek to cut off all of Irans oil sales, a manageable prospect given the current global supply glut and the drop in oil prices of about 30 percent since the summer. Congress could pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force against Iran, to at least make clear it will support the president if he acts. Congress could augment Israels capacity to strike Irans nuclear facilities by passing legislation that would sell Israel 30,000-pound Massive Ordinance Penetrators (MOPs)bunker-busters that can penetrate 200 feet below groundas well as spare B-52s, currently unused by the U.S. Air Force, to deliver them. This would boost our leverage with Iran, send a strong signal of support for Israel, and improve the chances for a successful Israeli strike if that proves necessary.
Congress could do all these things, but all that they would succeed in doing is killing any chance of an agreement with Iran. Imposing new sanctions would sabotage the negotiations, and they would also undermine international support for existing sanctions, which rely in large part on Irans trading partners cooperation to have any meaningful effect. Irans trading partners in Asia and more than a few in Europe would be very pleased with a deal that would allow them to resume their normal business, but they would probably be just as glad to resume that business whether or not an agreement is reached. Additional U.S. sanctions would give them a perfect excuse to resume business as usual, which would make another round of U.S. sanctions as futile as it is foolish. Jim Antle points out this downside of imposing more sanctions in his article today:
A sanctions regime without strong international support may make Senate cosponsors feel good about themselves, but it wont do much to influence Iranian behavior.
I doubt that Congress could bestir itself to pass an AUMF for Iran, since it seems so reluctant to pass an authorization for a war that the U.S. is already fighting, but it would be terrible if it did. Even if the Iranian government assumed that Obama would not act on such an authorization, the fact that it had been passed would be an additional and ongoing reason to distrust any offer the U.S. made. It would give Iran a pretext to abandon negotiations without incurring blame for their collapse. Worst of all, it would leave the door open to war with Iran at some point in the future. That would not only give Iran an excuse to walk away from negotiations, which would be bad enough, but it would give a future administration an opening to attack Iran at will. The threat by itself would probably be enough to strengthen the position of Iranian hard-liners to the detriment of all involved, and it would give those hard-liners another argument for acquiring a nuclear deterrent. Likewise, providing Israel with more weapons to create the impression that the U.S. wants to facilitate an Israeli attack would have much the same harmful effect on the prospects of a peaceful resolution of the issue. Each of these proposals would achieve nothing except to ratchet up tensions in the region and make a new armed conflict more likely, but then I assume that is why Iran hawks favor them.

The American Conservative,C,UVAs Jackie: A Wahoo Tawana Brawley? | The American Conservative,"Magazine editor Richard Bradley, who was taken in by one of Stephen Glasss hoax stories as an editor at another magazine, doesnt buy the blockbuster Rolling Stone story out of the University of Virginia. Why did he buy the salacious facts in the Glass story?:
The answer, I had to admit, was because they corroborated my pre-existing biases. I was well on the way to believing that Vernon Jordan was a philanderer, for exampleeveryone seemed to think so, back in the 90s.
So Stephen wrote what he knew I was inclined to believe. And because I was inclined to believe it, I abandoned my critical judgment. I lowered my guard.
The lesson I learned: One must be most critical, in the best sense of that word, about what one is already inclined to believe. So when, say, the Duke lacrosse scandal erupted, I applied that lesson. The story was so sensational! Believing it required indulging ones biases: A southern schoolrich white preppy boysa privileged sports teamlower class African-American womenrape. It read like a Tom Wolfe novel.
And of course it never happened.
The story of Jackie, the UVA gang rape victim, strikes him as like this. How come? Here:
The first thing that strikes me about it, of course, is that Jackie is never identified. I dont love thatit makes me uncomfortable to base an entire story on an unnamed source, and I cant think of any other situation other than rape where a publication would allow thatbut certainly one can see the rationale.
Then we have three friends who talked to Jackie right after the rape, and apparently discouraged her from going to the hospital or the authorities because they might subsequently be banned from frat parties. Not one of them is named, or interviewed; so the three people who could allegedly corroborate the assault dont.
Then theres the fact that Jackie apparently knew two of her rapists, but they are not named, nor does Rubin Erdley contact them, which is basically a cardinal rule of journalism: If someone in your story is accused of something, youd better do your damnedest to give them a chance to respond. Theres no sign that Rubin Erdley did so. Why not? Did she not know their names? Would Jackie not tell her? Because if Rubin Erdley knew their names and didnt call them, that is horrible journalism and undermines confidence in her reporting. And if she didnt know their nameswell, were back inPatrick Witt-landagain.
Finally theres the narrative of the gang rape itself. It is a terrible storyso terrible that, if it werent for the power of our preexisting biases, we would be hard-pressed to believe it.
Read the whole thing. Theres a lot more, and as someone who believed the Rolling Stone story, which spoke to my pre-existing biases about fraternities (the legacy of my GDI days at LSU), it makes me very queasy. Plus, the story does quote several women by name talking about their experiences with rape at UVA, and the UVA administration behaves in the story like a bureaucracy with something to hide (which doesnt mean that it actually does have anything to hide).
The WaPos Paul Farhi did a piece the other day on Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the journalist who wrote the piece. Its mostly admiring, but:

Some elements of the story, however, are apparently too delicate for Erdely to talk about now. She wont say, for example, whether she knows the names of Jackies alleged attackers or whether in her reporting she approached Drew, the alleged ringleader, for comment. She is bound to silence about those details, she said, by an agreement with Jackie, who is very fearful of these men, in particular Drew. . . . She now considers herself an empty shell. So when it comes down to identifying them, she has a very hard time with that.
The story does take one journalistic shortcut. The alleged assault, described in graphic detail, is presented largely without traditional qualifiers, such as according to Jackie or allegedly. The absence of such attribution or qualification leaves the impression that the events in question are undisputed facts, rather than accusations. Erdely said, however, that her writing style makes it clear that the events are being told from Jackies point of view.
In any case, there have been no outright denials from any party about the alleged crime Erdely reported, a rarity given the relative specificity of the allegations and the enormous impact of the story. Ageneral statement on the mattercame from Phi Kappa Psis Virginia chapter, which pledged its cooperation with a police investigation but said: We have no specific knowledge of the claims contained in the article.

Reasons Robby Soave takes it further:
I have no reason to disbelieve Erdely, and I understand why she would choose not to disclose anyones identity. But sheshouldbe able to confirm that she knows who the attackers are, shouldnt she? Again,wedont have to know who they are, but we should know thatsheknowsor else the story is just one long uncorroborated accusation. And regardless of whether or not the story is told from Jackies point of view, it was written by Erdely, who treats its contents as fact.
And:
However, some of the details do strike me as perplexing on subsequent re-reads. One issue now being raised by skeptics is the nature of her injuries, which sound as if they would have required immediate medical attention. (According to the story, everybody involved was basically rolling around in broken glass for hours.) If the frat brothers were absolute sociopaths to do this to Jackie, her friends were almost cartoonishly evilcasually dismissing her battered and bloodied state and urging her not to go to the hospital.
Tonight, Farhi published an update on the WaPo website confirming that neither the reporter or her editors ever talked to any of the men accused of gang-raping Jackie. This is a big, big problem, journalistically. You can say, They declined to comment for this article, but you have to make a good-faith effort to reach them. It seems clear now that Sabrina Rubin Erdely failed to do this Journalism 101 step  and this failure was evident in the article, for those with eyes to see (this blogs reader Ryan Booth, for one, questioned the article early on). This doesnt mean that the story is false, of course, but it does make it much harder to believe.
If this turns out to be a hoax, UVA will have suffered a devastating loss of reputation  and Rolling Stone will need to lawyer up. Meanwhile, a writer for the feminist blog Jezebel calls Bradley and Soave names for daring to question the story  this, even though both men qualify their criticism by saying quite clearly that the story might well have gone down exactly as RS reports, but the reporter took some real liberties with her writing that warrant skepticism. By the way, Judith Shulevitz at the New Republic is also sounding skeptical. Jezebels scribe forgot to call her a self-hating woman who ought to shut her face. Im sure theyll get around to it.
UPDATE:I was thinking just now, reading the comments, why I shooed away the ordinary skeptical questions that came to mind when I read the story. Im predisposed against liking fraternities, but I have never believed them to be rape mobs (though I think a group of young men and lots of booze are capable of most anything). For me, it was a matter of this Rolling Stone piece playing into a narrative that has come to have enormous emotional resonance within me: a story about a system that, when faced with evidence that the strong within it are preying sexually upon the weak, chooses to ignore or otherwise dismiss the gravity of the crimes, for the sake of protecting its own image. Its pretty obvious why I am primed to believe these claims: because this is exactly what happened, again and again and again, with the Catholic Church. And yet, the familiarity of this narrative does not mean that when it is alleged  within the Church or other institutions, like UVA  that it actually happened. Here I am griping at the Ferguson partisans for believing that Mike Brown has to be Darren Wilsons sacrificial lamb, despite the evidence (because it fit their preferred narrative about How Cops Treat Black People), but I was prepared to believe Jackies story on the basis of little real evidence offered because it fit my preferred narrative of How Institutions Treat Victims Who Have Been Sexually Assaulted By The Powerful. Damn. It seems that its not possible to learn the confirmation bias lesson often enough.

The American Conservative,C,Channing Tatum. Wrestling Picture. Whadaya Need  A Road Map? | The American Conservative,"Foxcatcher, the new film directed by Bennett Miller, is based on a true story. David and Mark Schultz really were gold-medal-winning American wrestlers at the 1984 Olympics. John du Pont really was the incredibly wealthy scion of the du Pont fortune, and he really did lure the Schultz brothers and other young wrestlers to his estate, Foxcatcher, to train for the 1988 Olympics. And (spoilers  lots of spoilers  stop reading if you hate spoilers) John DuPont really did end up murdering David.
But why did he end up killing him? What did the crime mean? Whats thestory here, as opposed to whats merely true?
The film, based on Marks book about his experiences, appears to make Mark the protagonist  its his story. When we first meet Mark, hes living on the edge of poverty, even though hes already won a gold medal, eating ramen for dinner and taking $20 speaking gigs at middle schools. Hes an angry, frustrated, impacted man, his rage at the world  and at his brother, who was also effectively his parent after their parents divorce  bursting out and then being shoved firmly back in.
His life changes when John du Pont enters the picture, inviting him to his mothers horse farm, Foxcatcher, where he has built a state-of-the-art training facility for Mark and his fellow Olympic wrestlers. From the beginning, its clear that du Pont is a deeply odd duck, and it doesnt take long for us to learn that hes potentially quite dangerous  but its not at all clear that Mark understands this. He seems genuinely to buy in to the thoroughly unpersuasive line of bull about America and freedom and victory that du Pont is handing out, seems all-too-willing to call du Pont a mentor, even a father.
Channing Tatum, I have to say at this point, does an exceptional job of inhabiting this emotionally weak and pliable young hulk  the best work Ive ever seen him do. I completely believed that Mark bought into du Pont, and that, once he figured out that du Pont was a problem, and was sucking him into a completely one-sided and destructive relationship rather than actually helping him to win, he couldnt see how to escape it.The structural problem with the film, though, is that Mark never breaks out of that state of dependency.
Du Pont eventually turns on Mark, and offers David enough money to come up to Foxcatcher to be his de-jure assistant, de-facto head coach. Mark resents this, and acts out  until its clear that he cant win on his own. Then his brother saves him from himself, and ultimately facilitates his escape from Foxcatcher and from du Pont, leveraging his importance to the operation to get a guaranteed income for Mark even after Mark leaves Foxcatcher and cuts ties with du Pont.
Mark, in other words, never achieves real independence, emotional or financial. He moves from dependence on his brother (the good mentor and father figure) to dependence on du Pont (the bad mentor and father figure) and back to dependence on his brother. And, from the final scene of the film, it looks like once his brother is dead, he descends into the lurid and degraded world of cage fighting  the final betrayal of his Olympian achievement.
I want to be clear: the problem is not that this is a downer. I love a good downer. The problem is that Marks failure to achieve independence means that the story doesnt really have an arc, and that therefore I dont know what his story means.
Why, after all, does Mark fall for du Pont? I dont mean why does he take the gig  he desperately needs the money, and while the film could do a better job of making it clear why hes so poor (to maintain his eligibility for the Olympics under then-extant rules, Mark had to remain an amateur, which meant not getting paid for any athletic activity), his financial need is manifest. But David has similar pecuniary reasons for compromise, and he never falls for du Pont for a second  hes clear eyed about what hes doing. Why does Mark fall for him?
One possibility is that Mark is responding to the fact that du Pont clearly has some kind of desire for him. Most of the chatter about the film has focused on du Ponts sexuality, and the film can be powerfully critiqued for playing into lurid gay stereotypes. But,as Jordan Schildcrout points out, the real problem isnt that du Pont embodies those stereotypes  maybe the real du Pont was like that  but that he doesnt have much interiority, that the film doesnt really let us know what its like to be him. But that, in turn, is only a fatal problem if this is du Ponts movie. And it isnt. Its Marks. This isnt Gods and Monsters in which the presumably-straight young hulk is just the observer, so we can be seduced by the fascinating older monster along with him. Mark is the point. What does he see in du Pont?
Well, what it looks like to me is that Mark is telling the truth when he says, in words du Pont put in his mouth, that he was looking for a father figure, and he finally found one. Du Pont is a pretty pathetic father figure, but hes one Mark found on his own, and therefore one that can separate him from his brother. The film gestures toward the possibility that Mark is involved sexually with du Pont, but inasmuch as it gestures that way  having Mark frost the tips of his hair, having him wrestle with du Pont at night in the gym  it also suggests that Mark is humiliated by the relationship. The obvious, surface read for that is a homophobic one  Mark is humiliated that a man has a sexual interest in him. But I think a deeper way to read it is that theres a kind of quasi-incestuous betrayal playing out in Marks mind as he realizes that his new father is a weak and emotionally hungry man who just wants to use him. It really doesnt matter whether that use includes sex or not.
But that understanding makes it all the more imperative that Mark achieve some kind of independence. Instead, Mark is saved by his brother, and drifts out of the movie. Du Pont finally kills David  because David took away his surrogate son and love object, and because David refused to say anything nice about him on the hagiographic video he had produced about himself. David forced him to confront his own manifest impotence, and so he had to be killed. And, reading the ending back into earlier parts of the movie, Davids decision to stay with du Pont reads like a sacrifice of his own life to save his brother.
Now, consider how the film would read if, instead, Mark had killed du Pont. Mark is clearlyjealous when his brother arrives. Hes angry at du Pont for saying that the team cant succeed without David  that Marks not good enough. Hes furious at his brother seeing him in the degraded state to which hes fallen (thats clearly how he thinks of it). What if, later, when his brother tries to save him from the meal ticket that he, Mark, had found for all of them, that only heightened his impotent rage, ultimately leading him to kill du Pont.
That would have been a much more lurid film. It might have played even more problematically in terms of what it was saying about the psycho-sexual overtones of the relationship between Mark and du Pont. But it would have kept Mark at the center. The question would have remained: who is this man, and what will he do? And I think it would have been more narratively satisfying.
Thats not how it happened, of course. But then again, there are a lot of other things in the film that vary from how it happened.
For example: Steve Carrells du Pont is a fascinating and creepy creation, and totally real  petty, stupid, emotionally stunted, but real. One of my favorite things about his performance is the way in which he reveals du Ponts human vulnerability at the same moment that he makes it all the more clear how deeply disturbed the character is. The scene on the helicopter, when du Pont takes cocaine and actually smiles as he plays with multi-syllable words; the scene after Mark has given him a haircut, and du Pont thanks him for being such a good friend, unlike his only childhood friend who his mother paid to play with him  forgetting, apparently, that exactly the same pecuniary relationship obtains with Mark. Those kinds of scenes.
What he doesnt seem is obviously psychotic. Which the real du Pont apparently was:
John du Pont was insane. There was no doubt about that, even early on. I only met him a few timeshe didnt regularly attend training sessionsbut even casual contact with John left me with an uneasy feeling. He had a bizarre look in his eyes thats unlike anything Ive ever seen. Even a chance encounter with John just left you with strange pangs of foreboding.
Stories about Johns strange behavior were legion. He had a bad habit of driving inebriated around the estate and crashing into things. On more than one occasion, he drove the car into a pond. He also regularly carried a handgun with him and once, during his 50th birthday party, he inexplicably starting shooting off anAK-47.
By all accounts, in the months leading up to the shooting Johns behavior became even more bizarre. He kicked three African-American athletes off the farm,sayingthat Foxcatcher was run by the Ku Klux Klan andconfrontedone wrestler, Dan Chaid, by pointing anassaultrifle at his chest. The warning signs were there, but it was hard for anyone to admit it.
Why was it hard to admit it? Because all the wrestlers needed that meal ticket. Theres a story there to tell, a lurid parable of America in the 1980s, in which du Ponts wealth lures the wrestling world up to his farm, where he prances about like a mad hatter with an AK-47 and everybody looks away because they need the money. And, again, Foxcatcher gestures toward that film  but the tone of that film is incompatible with the tone of the story of Mark and du Ponts emotionally stunted folie deux.
To see what I mean, consider the difference in tone between Foxcatcher and what is probably the emblematic 1980s movie about money. Like Mark, the Charlie Sheen character Bud Fox in Wall Street,  which came out in 1987, the year in which Foxcatcher is set  is torn between two mentors and father figures: the good one (Foxs actual father, a union leader at an airline), and the bad one (Gordon Gekko). But there the comparisons end. Gekko stands for something; hes an attractive anti-heroic figure. Fox is a young man of promise. Were seduced along with him  because Gekko is the true spirit of the age.Du Pont, by contrast, is repellent from the moment we meet him. There is nothing  nothing  attractive about this man. Hes obviously weak, creepy, stupid and dangerous.
If we read the film is a kind of parable of the malign 1%, with Mark as America,then its a pretty damning comment on America that we were ever seduced by the Reaganite myth. I mean, who but an emotionally weak and vulnerable idiot would ever be genuinely seduced by the likes of John du Pont? On that level, I get the movie, but it feels weirdly displaced in time  a parable of the Great Recession pasted onto the era of greed is good.
By contrast, consider how the film would play out if David were the main character. Mark Ruffalo plays David as a conscientious and fundamentally giving person, without ever making him seem like a goody-goody or somebody without guts in his belly. Hes both a good man and a real man. It makes sense that Mark could get sucked into du Ponts orbit, and couldnt figure out how to escape. What does it mean that David was willing, for the right price, to take his place?
Now weve got a story to tell  a story in which David thinks hes protecting his brother, thinks hes promoting the sport of wrestling, thinks hes doing all the right things. Du Pont can be a monster  he can even be the creepy monster of this film, and not somebody seductive at all. Maybe that very manifest weakness and stupidity is why David, representing the best of America, thinks he can handle the monster of gruesome wealth, accept its suzerainty for the sake of the good it can do. And then the monster kills him.
But thats Davids story. Not Marks.
This has been a difficult write-up for me, because I really like stories in which each character has weight, in which we can even be confused about who exactly is the protagonist. One of the scripts I wrote, the one Im probably most attached to, works that way a bit  though there is a main character, I try to give you the perspective of each of the major characters, see the whole film from the inside as each of them would. Many of Chekhovs plays are like that  is there really a single protagonist ofThe Cherry Orchard orThe Three Sisters orUncle Vanya? I dont think so.
Im just not sure this is that kind of story. Theres a powerful story hidden in this film, about fatherlessness and emotional dependence, about the corruptions of wealth  particularly hereditary wealth  and the impossible demands of American masculinity. And Tatum, Carrell and Ruffalo all give gripping and nuanced performances  plenty strong enough to keep me in the film. Im unequivocally glad I saw it  would be happy to see it again.
I just worry that the truth got in the way of the story.

The American Conservative,C,Europes Conchita Wurst Consensus | The American Conservative,"When the 2014 pan-European Eurovision song contest was won by an Austrian singer doing a drag queen act under the stage name Conchita Wurst, Western media hailed the victory as signaling a new era of tolerance in Europe. No better symbol was needed for the success of liberal democracy in the old continent; Brussels especially was ecstatic, and the European Parliament quickly extended an invitation to Wurst to perform on its premises.
Eurovision is an old event that seeks to promote European unity through entertainment, but the show often instead gives evidence of continued differences and regional conflicts. Viewers phone in to vote on who should receive their countrys points. Old dividing lines often emerge when Greeks dont vote for Turkish contestants, Armenians for Azeris, Russians for Ukrainians, etc.
Reveling in their progressive pride, many may have missed the interesting fact that of all the states that awarded points to Austrias Conchita Wurst, only one, Slovenia, was Slavic. For that matter, Slovenia once belonged to the Austrian Empire and the two countries maintain close ties, which might explain the neighborly support. Conversely, the other six Slavic states were apparently not impressed by the culturally innovative Austria. Indeed, not one former Warsaw Pact country cast its votes for Wurst, nor did Muslim Albania or staunchly Catholic Malta.
One of the unspoken truths of the EUs successive enlargements to the East is precisely the dissimilar cultural values of the new entrants. Many of the new member-states actually vote for MEPs who end up joining the ranks of Eurosceptic parties in the European Parliament. Gay pride parades have met numerous difficulties in the new members societies, and in 2013, one of the most liberal societies of the Western Balkansand the latest member of the EUCroatia, actually voted to ban gay marriage. The same is the case with such current applicants for accession as Serbia or Turkey. Turkeys AKP party governments have dialed back the conquests of Ataturks secularism; Serbia is even more socially conservative than Croatia.
The EU speaks of its power of attraction in the region, an attraction allegedly inspired by shared and universal values. One might recall the EU flags in the background of Mikhail Saakashvilis office during his 2008 wartime broadcasts pleading with the West for help, or more recently those waved during the Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine. Yet while both Georgia and Ukraine wish to join the EU and NATO, even the EUs current eastern members pale in comparison to Tbilisi and Kiev when it comes to homophobia and intolerance. In truth, many of the activists in Georgia and Ukraine promoting the European path are themselves not the most liberal minded peopleeven excluding the ultra-nationalists.
So why do they so desperately see their future in Europe? What drives a nation like Serbia to bend over backwards to ingratiate itself with institutions and countries that were just a few years ago its tormentors and enemies, risking even its historical claima claim backed by an insurmountable pile of international lawto Kosovo? Western polling on the matter clearly reveals that societies in Central and Eastern Europe consistently choose the Brussels and Washington path over Moscows socially conservative message.
The Western narrative is confident that the younger generation, the one organizing the gay pride parades, risking their lives in exposing corruption, serving as the cannon fodder for the dogs and brutal paramilitary forces of authoritarian regimes in the region, will turn around the backward mentality of the regions masses.
There are also large numbers of the new generation that are swayed by less liberal ideas, however. In Russia for example, the Kremlin has cultivated young nationalist initiatives, and the appearance of neo-Nazis and other radicals throughout the region, is certainly not a phenomenon driven by the elderly.
The most important difference between radicals and liberals is that liberals have the political and financial support of the West, and radicals do not. Liberals can promise investment as well as access to a larger export market, radicalsespecially autarkic onescannot.
Through academia, the NGO sector, and industrial delocalization, the Western imprint on these societies exerts an important form of soft power. American and European funding of exchange programs, activism, or simple foreign direct investment, has, since 1989, artificially swelled the critical mass of liberals in these societies. It is in fact impressive to observe the disproportionate number of young adults who in their respective capital cities, professionally depend, directly or indirectly, on some form of Western development aidand this counts double for territories under international protectorate such as Kosovo or Bosnia-Herzegovina.
When highly individualistic liberal westerners looked at the velvet revolutions behind the Iron Curtain, they saw themselves. If the French had rid themselves of absolutist monarchs, the British from authoritarian republicans, and the Nordics from Nazi occupation, then it stood to reason that overthrowing despotic communist regimes was also a path towards a liberal society; this perception held even when some movements were clearly inspired by religious tradition, others by simple economic misery, and all by nationalism.
One of the easy critiques emanating from Moscow these days is that some activists fighting for the new regime in Kiev are neo-Nazis and ultranationalists. While this is true, it also reveals the nature of the alliance between Eastern Europeans and the West: for the former, such an alliance is purely instrumental, serving the purpose of eliciting Western aid to the common anti-Russia cause.
The scholar Stathis Kalyvas describes the utter parochialism of societies different from the West and the purely tactical role played by ideologies in procuring external power assistance for purposes of domestic power conquest. In his words, local cleavages are typically articulated in the language of the wars master cleavage, often instrumentally
This is precisely what happens in the border between Europe and Asia and why high-minded policies invariably end up propping the weaker party against adverse odds. Furthermore, the phenomenon is not new.
By the time the 1848 revolutions had arrived in far-eastern Europe, totalitarian ideologies had taken over Western Europe. Thus, many of the local ethnic irredentist leaders that sided with the invading Nazi armies did so only nominally. From the shores of the Black Sea to those of the Baltic, the social consensus for liberation impelled the native populations to welcome the Wehrmacht as liberators, and to seek to shine a modern national-socialist light on their more primitive desire for ethnic emancipation and Russophobe resistance; hence the Eastern European Spring of the Peoples came into a bad reputation.
Similarly, the multi-national missions or the international community responses carried out today, are embedded in paradoxical strategic interests and serve, often, almost completely symbolic purposes.
Estonian troops are not mobilized to the Central African Republic because they bring unique assets or competencies, any more than Ukrainian and Georgian troops did in Iraq. And it is difficult to discern how soldiers trained for harsh winter conditions in a Slavic area would be of particular use in desert and tropical environments in Africa or the Middle East.
Their true agenda is rather to further add to the rhetorical entrapment of the West: if solidarity and world order demand international contributions, so too one day such contributions will be required to protect New Europe from the likes of Russia.
This is the nature of the Conchita Wurst Consensus. It is an exchange between dissimilar cultures that results in a superficial political compromise. During the communist era, Socialist Bloc citizens had a saying, they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work. Perhaps today it should go, they pretend to protect us and we pretend to admire them.

The American Conservative,C,"Double Feature Feature: 10,000 Hours Edition | The American Conservative","Whiplash, the new film from writer/director Damien Chazelle, will surely earn J. K. Simmons his first Oscar nomination, and may be a contender for other nominations as well. Its an engrossing story about afolie a deuxbetween two strong-willed artistic personalities, and the overpowering drive for greatness. Its simple, its got a powerful drive, and its got a very direct and overwhelming performance. The Academy will eat it up.
Its also got a hollowness at its core, which I dont think will hurt it one bit. It didnt hurt another film that got the Academys attention a few years back, also about an artist consumed with ambition. That film, Darren Aronofskys Black Swan, won Natalie Portman an Oscar for her performance as a driven young ballerina. On the surface, the contrasts with Whiplash are more notable than the similarities  to begin with, Aronofskys film is far bigger, more visually inventive, more overtly expressionist in its method, while Chazelles is a classic small-scale indie film  but I think they have something essential in common that is worth picking at like a scab on our cultures soul. To whit:an unwillingness  or inability  to wrestle something far more elusive than artistic ambition: the true nature of artistic genius.
Chazelles film follows Andrew (Miles Teller), a drummer at a prestigious music school called Schaffer Academy (a thinly-disguised Juilliard). Andrew is determined to become one of the great jazz drummers in history, and the surest ticket to that destiny (as he sees it) is to earn a spot in the studio band run by the famously abusive Mr. Fletcher (played with great gusto by Mr. Simmons). Nobody else sees anything much in Andrew  his father is at best perplexed by his ambition to be a great drummer, and the rest of his family is downright hostile (and Andrew returns that hostility tenfold). But Fletcher sees something in Andrew, and asks him to join his band when Andrew is still a freshman. Thus begins a classic sado-masochistic mentor-mentee relationship, Fletcher alternating between building Andrew up and ruthlessly cutting him down, including humiliating him in front of his fellow musicians, repeated physical assault, and a host of twisted mind games.
Andrew buys in completely to Fletchers theory of greatness, according to which the best way to produce great artists is to demand the impossible of them, and to abuse them mercilessly when fail to deliver, the better to motivate them to try harder.There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job,  Fletcher says, and Andrew smiles in agreement.
Its worth noting that while their meeting of the minds happens very quickly, this particular exchange takes place after quite a bit of plot has washed under the bridge. Andrew has, by this point in the film, already been through several cycles of favor and disfavor complete with tongue-lashings and flung furniture; has already demonstrated the insanity of his commitment by demanding to play the drums in competition immediately after crawling bloody from a car he has just totaled in a horrific accident; and, most important, has already turned on his former mentor in retaliation for his most-recent rejection, resulting in his mentor losing his job. Andrew believed in Fletchers philosophy before Fletcher ever arrived on the scene, and he still believes in it after hes formally rejected him. And sure enough, the film builds to a climax and conclusion that appears to validate Fletchers philosophy completely.
Fletcher thinks of himself as a counter-cultural figure, railing against the prevailing acceptance of mediocrity, but hes just representing another strain in our culture: theTiger Mother, vigorously applying the spur of negative motivation to ultimate achievement. His notion of where greatness comes from is very Malcolm Gladwell; you practice for 10,000 hours, and you at least have a chance. And his currency is external recognition: winning the competition, impressing the audience, getting a job. This is not counter-cultural; if anything, whats notable about Whiplash is how unaware it is of the achievement focus of our culture generally. Its as is nobody in Andrews world had seen The Hunger Games or Divergent or Enders Game or any other piece of contemporary adolescent dystopia pitting children against each other in a brutal contest contrived by adults. Had they done so, they might have recognized Fletcher as a type.
The thing is, its not obvious that most of Fletchers abuse has anything to do with promoting outstanding musicianship, as opposed to promoting a twisted emotional dependence on his personal favor. Fletcher doesnt do any instruction. He doesnt teach. Moreover, theres no sense that there are particular qualities of play to be cultivated; Fletcher is all about accuracy, being on tempo and on pitch. Now, these things are incredibly important, especially for a drummer, but while good musicianship definitely requires these things, its also about feel  indeed, without feel, all the accuracy in the world wont get you anywhere near greatness. But feel is something Fletcher seems to have no interest in. And neither does Andrew  his own practice seems focused, overwhelmingly, on going faster, faster, faster.

Black Swan would seem to start in a similar place when it comes to the question of what makes great art, but to end somewhere different. Its heroine, Nina Sayers (Ms. Portman), is the same kind of driven personality, determined to be great. Shes devoted her entire life to this ambition, spurred on by her former-dancer mother (a deliciously over-the-top Barbara Hershey), and to the exclusion of any kind of social or romantic life. As with Whiplash, the story turns on an unexpected opportunity to move up the ladder  in Sayerss case, to play the lead in a production of Swan Lake. And theres a mentor,Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), who isnt above playing some mind games, particularly pitting her against another rising ballerina, Lily (Mila Kunis).
Leroys main objective, though, isnt to push Sayers to her physical and mental limit  shes already doing that to herself  but to open her up to a more ecstatic dimension of experience; to find her dark and passionate side so that she can actually play the Black Swan as well as the White. It seems that practice, discipline, and ascetic athleticism arent enough. You have to live. You have to feel.
Theres an obviously erotic dimension to this emotional opening-up, but Sayers ultimately finds her dark passion not in that erotic awakening but in finally giving full rein to the violence of her ambition, and killing her rival  at least in her mind; much of the pleasure of Aronofskys film lies in the distinctive way in which he blurs the line between reality and fantasy, and the visceral impact of his own imagination (particularly as it relates to the horror of corporeality itself). In any event, when she finally lets go, she is able to dance the role with the required abandon  but at the price of her own destruction.
That sounds like almost the opposite of where Chazelles film goes  but under the surface, they share something deeper in common, and that is a fundamental lack of interest in the experience of creating art, the reduction of that experience to achievement, to passing some kind of test. We never really understand why Sayers wants to be a dancer, or what she gets out of dancing, beyond achieving what her mother never did. We dont ever really understand why Andrew wants to be a drummer, or what he gets out of drumming, beyond wanting to prove to his uncomprehending family that he is great. The thing itself  the dance, the music  isnt really in view.
Unlike Chazelles, Aronofskys film is aware that his heroine is missing something  but its the wrong something. Its not sex, or the love of the body, that Sayers is missing. Its a love of the dance. And the film  which is so visually striking that you know Aronofsky is in love with his own medium of film  is missing it, too. You dont come away from Black Swan with any feeling for dance.

Artistic genius is an elusive thing. Romantics tend to think of it as something innate, that only needs to be let out. And there is an element of the innate, most often; the great painters, writers, musicians, etc.  most of them started out with a gift. But not all of them, and not all to the same degree. Czanne was not Picasso. Beethoven was not Mozart. Some truly great artists are more labored, and you can tell, while others make it look effortless.
What they have in common, though, is a fierce attachment, a love, of the activity itself, not for the sake of recognition, not as an index of personal achievement, but for the sake of the thing itself and what is being done. And thats even true of drummers, those work-horses of the music world who one too often thinks of as only serving as a kind of background for the real musicians.
For my proof text, Ill offer the documentary, Beware of Mr. Baker. Much of the film is devoted to Ginger Bakers chaotic life and apparently unscratchable itch for personal conflict. But much of it is about the music, the one thing that Ginger Baker loved unequivocally and passionately in a life otherwise marked by a great deal of anger, spite and outright misanthropy.
I came out of that film energized, filled with a ludicrous desire to be as good as Ginger Baker at, well, at anything. Not because I wanted to prove something to an uncomprehending father or an over-controlling mother, but because I could hear, I could feel, what he was doing  and I could see, on his face, thathe could feel it, too. That feeling looked like something worth having, worth more than many more comfortable things in life. Certainly more than praise from the teacher.
Thats the feeling I never got looking at the face of Miles Teller  or the face of Natalie Portman. Thats what they have in common, and it is the saddest thing about both films.

The American Conservative,C,What Are National Rights? | The American Conservative,"Im puzzled by the so-called Jewish State bill currently in the process of making its way into Israeli law.
Not by the politics of the law  that I understand. The law is a classic wedge issue, a symbolic way of spitting in the eyes of ones opponents. Its disgraceful, but its not exactly uncommon in politics.All the right people  that is to say, the left people  will be outraged, and in their outrage will say things that convince all the right people  that is to say, the people on the right  that they had better vote for patriotic parties in the upcoming election.
But would the bill actually do anything?
The original context in which the law was drawn up would be comical were it not so pathetic. The Israeli government demands that, as part of any peace agreement, the Palestinian side recognize Israel as a Jewish State, something the Palestinian side has always explicitly refused to do.When the bill was originally conceived, the notion was that, if Israel were defined in law as a Jewish State, then recognizing Israel would by definition be recognizing its Jewish character  and surely the Palestinians would not withdraw their recognition of Israel as such. Thus: de-facto recognition of Israel as a Jewish State would be accomplished.
This was a ludicrous rationale for a law on its face, because it was obviously not going to work. You cant premise success in negotiating a peace agreement on the idea of tricking the other side into agreeing to something that they dont actually support, or on the idea of tricking your own camp into believing their objectives have been met. This really is playground-appropriate stuff.
But Benjamin Netanyahu, in defending the bill, argued that there was a substantive purpose as well: preserving the national rights of the Jewish nation without, as he saw it, contravening the precepts of democracy:
The state of Israel is a Jewish and a democratic state. These two values are intertwined, and one does not outweigh the other. We promise equal rights for everyone, regardless of religion, race or sex. At the same time, Israel is the nation-state of the Jews only. This combination between the the rights of the nation and the rights of the individual, serves as the central thread in all of Israels founding documents.
What are those rights of the nation that Netanyahu refers to? As examples, Netanyahu cited a flag, anthem, the right of every Jew to immigrate to Israel and other national symbols.
Heres what I find puzzling about this. Suppose that there were a proposal to change the Israeli flag to something less-identified with the Jewish people  say, one of those tricolors the Europeans are so mad for. What would the consequence of the Jewish State law be for such a proposal? Would it be inadmissible for consideration in the Knesset? Would only Jewish MKs be allowed to vote on it? How would the Jewish nation exercise its national rights on this question?
Obviously, these kinds of prohibitions would be transparently undemocratic. But if nothing of the sort is contemplated, what, exactly, is being codified here, other than a reaffirmation of the status quo?
Well, we should be clear about what the status quo means  within the Green Line, not in the territories. It means that Arab citizens can be discriminated against in housing, including state-supported efforts to move Jewish citizens into Arab-dominated regions coupled with local discrimination to keep Arab citizens out of Jewish areas. That they can be discriminated against in education  most Arab citizens are educated in a separate school system from Jewish Israelis (actually, there are three official streams in Israeli education, secular state schools, Jewish religious state schools, and Arab schools, plus a large set of ultra-Orthodox Jewish religious schools that are outside state control but receive state support, plus a small smattering of independent schools, but now Ive probably given too much information). And so forth.
That status quo has substantial majority support among Jewish Israelis. But it does not have overwhelming support among the judiciary. The High Court recently upheld the current law that permits discrimination against Arab applicants in housing in small communities, but did so on a narrow majority on largely procedural grounds. Theres every reason to believe that, even as the country moves right, the judiciary might increasingly flex its muscles against that majoritys efforts to criminalize dissent and sanction invidious discrimination.
This, in my view, is the most tangible practical significance of the Jewish State bill: that it would provide a legal justification for upholding the legitimacy of the discriminatory aspects of the status quo when faced with legal challenge.
The Law of Return, after all, already exists, as does the Chief Rabbinate, the national anthem, the flag, and so forth. None of these are expressions of liberal ideals, but none of them exceptional among nations either  other countries have flags and anthems that reflect or come to embody a national character, established religions are hardly unheard of (particularly in Israels region), and even the idea of immigration preference for the dominant ethnic groupis common among countries with a large co-ethnic diaspora. Theres no plausible purpose to a law that merely reiterates these things that are already established, and no way that passing such a law would secure them against a popular majority that actually wanted to change them  and meanwhile a majority of Israeli citizens is moving rapidly in the other directionpolitically-speaking,so such a liberal majority is not exactly in the offing. The only practical threat to existing arrangements comes from the courts. So thats where I locate the practical import of the law.
The more pressing practical question of identity that Israel needs to deal with, as Ive been saying for years, is whether to grant national minority rights to its Arab sector, which would imply a higher degree of autonomy in questions of land use and so forth. If Israel really does want to remain a Jewish national state while also moving towards something resembling fair treatment of its Arab minority, that would seem to be the direction to go.
Meanwhile: if Netanyahu is really determined to place the question of the Jewish character of the state beyond the reach of democratic politics, I modestly propose that he go all the way,and thereby remove all doubt about where the country is headed.

The American Conservative,C,Grand Strategy Is Bunk | The American Conservative,"Since the 1990s, the teaching and advocacy of grand strategy has become something of a cottage industry. Degree programs and courses are on offer at Duke, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the City University of New York, Temple University, Columbia University, Bard College, MIT, Georgetown, and Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). The countrys leading grand-strategy program, Yale Universitys, is supported by a $17.5 million endowment and has received generous backing from the legendary financier Roger M. Hertog.
Yales program is apparently so well-heeled that in recent years it has been able to recruit such luminaries as retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, Henry Kissinger, and New York Times columnist David Brooks to hold forth on the wisdom and rightness of Americas foreign-policy master plans.
In his unimaginatively titled 2010 book, Grand Strategies, Yales Charles Hill, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz, sought to subordinate the Western literary canon to the service of an interpretive history of interstate politics. The phenomenon of intellectuals who deploy higher (artistic) means to serve base (political) ends is not a new one. As the Soviet dissident Andrei Sinyavsky noted, Soviet literature of the twenties and thirties reveals an odd and unusual friendship between writers and Chekists.
That aside, grand strategy has a pedigree that reaches as far back as the fin de siclearound the time, not coincidentally, that America emerged as a world power in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War of 1898. That year, while visiting his friend John Haysoon to be secretary of stateHenry Adams recalled in his characteristic third-person prose: listening to any member of the British Cabinet, for all were alike now, discuss the Philippines as a question of balance of power in the East he could see that the family work of a hundred and fifty years fell at once into the grand perspective of true empire-building.
Was this the first insider account of the nascent art of Anglo-American grand strategizing? Perhaps. But Henry Adams was too wise to give it overmuch thought. The grand-strategy enthusiast in the family was his younger brother, Brooks. In 1900, Brooks Adams released his book Americas Economic Supremacy in eager anticipation of the timesoon, in his tellingwhen the British would be obliged to pass the torch of world leadership to their former colonial subjects. According to Brooks, in bumptious Teddy Roosevelt-like prose very much the opposite of his older brothers, America must fight her own battles whether she wills or no. From the inexorable decree of destiny she cannot escape.  All signs point to the approaching supremacy of the United States.
And so from the very start there has been an almost teleological aspect to American grand strategy, that inexorable decree of destiny. But if Adamss thinking showed signs of historical (and possibly divine) determinism, the grand strategy of Britains Alfred Mackinder was indicative of a mind held captive by the idea that geography is destiny. His 1904 essay The Geographical Pivot of History put forward the propositionwhich would in some ways be echoed by V.I. Lenins Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism in 1917that access to colonial markets was crucial to the health of the state, and imperial competition would lessen the chances of major class conflict at home. The fight over foreign markets would inevitably, in this telling, lead to interstate conflict.
In 1919, Mackinder published Democratic Ideals and Reality, in which he put forward his famous axiom that He who rules East Europe commands the Heartland: Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island: Who rules the World-Island commands the World. In a sense, Mackinders ideas on the strategic primacy of Eastern Europe and the danger of Russian hegemony over Eurasia are similar to those that guide our newest generation of American Cold Warriors today.
While Mackinder stressed the primacy of land power and preventing Russia from gaining the great inland fortress of the World-Island, American grand strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan stressed the importance of maintaining military superiority upon the seas. In numerous books such as The Influence of Sea Power Upon the French Revolution and Empire, 1783-1812, Mahan put forward the notion that an army could be forced into submission through the application of a naval blockade, which he called the most striking and awful mark of sea power.
By the late 1930s the forerunner to todays grand-strategy courses was taking shape. According to the sociologist John Bellamy Foster, in 1939 the State Department joined forces with the Council on Foreign Relations to form a War and Peace Studies program, with the help of a generous grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The program focused on a geographic region called the Grand Area, which according to Foster was seen to constitute an informal empire, modeled after U.S. domination of Latin America, involving the free flow of capital, under the economic, political, and military hegemony of the United States.
But it was after World War II, in 1947, that grand strategy really caught the imagination of American policymakers. That year George F. Kennan, elaborating upon the ideas of Mackinder and the political scientist Nicholas John Spykman, laid out the first draft of what would become Americas strategy of containment vis--vis the Soviet Union. It was with his Long Telegram that the concept of American grand strategy made its way from the academic periphery to becoming a central tenet in the Washington establishments conception of world leadership.
The results, by and large, have been abysmal. Kennan, realizing what he had wrought, spent the remainder of his long career trying in vain to undo the forces his dispatch helped unleash. After the containment strategy was enshrined as official policy by the NSC-68 report during the Truman administration, successive presidents would attempt to elaborate on the original directive by issuing addendumscommonly and pretentiously referred to as presidential doctrinesof one kind or another. These doctrines, particularly those promulgated during the last 40 years, reveal the shortcomings of grand strategy.
The Carter Doctrine, for instance, declared that the Persian Gulf was now a vital interest of the United States of America and that any attempt by an outside power to gain control of the region would be repelled by any means necessary, including military force. Thus began the countrys four-decade (and counting) commitment to the security of some the planets most noxious regimes. The Reagan Doctrine made even less strategic sense, pledging support for anti-communist insurgents wherever they might be, in places of such intrinsic strategic value as Nicaragua and Afghanistan. The fruits of this policy hardly need to be elaborated.
George H.W. Bushs administration gave rise to a grand strategy that went on to serve as the template for American foreign policy until the Obama administration. The assumptions that underlie Bush the Firsts Defense Planning Guidance of 1992 differ very little from those which animated the grand strategy put forward a decade later by George W. Bush. The National Security Strategy of the United States in 2002 stated, among other things, that the U.S. would act to preclude the emergence of a peer military competitor anywhere in the world.
Now consider: each one of these iterations of presidential grand strategy has resulted in an unarguable diminution of American power, prestige, and treasure. And while it is entirely possible that the strategies themselves were to blame, I suspect the true culprit is the concept. From the beginning, efforts to formulate a grand strategy have too often served to exacerbate an American tendency that some of our more thoughtful statesmen have been only too happy to discourage: a binary view of the world born of a sincerely held belief in the myth of our collective national innocence.
What rankles our modern-day grand strategists about President Obama is partly that he has failed to enunciate an Obama Doctrine. Yet worse, in their eyes, is that his hesitancy seems to be an implicit rejection of the claims of American exceptionalismwhich, from the time of Brooks Adams onward, has been an integral assumption of American grand strategy.

The American Conservative,C,A Fraternity of Rape | The American Conservative,"UVA may be to fraternities what Boston was to the Catholic Church @CaitlinPacific
 W Bradford Wilcox (@WilcoxNMP) November 23, 2014
Brad Wilcox, by the way, is a sociologist who teaches at the University of Virginia. I had heard nothing of the UVA rape scandal until he linked via his Twitter feed to Rolling Stones blockbuster expos of the rape culture among the schools fraternities. Please read this, especially if you have sons or daughters in college, or who will be in college one day.
It begins with a first-year female student named Jackie, invited upstairs by her date, a fraternity brother in Phi Kappa Psi, one of the oldest and most prestigious male Greek organizations on the UVA campus.Here is a serenade from that national fraternitys songbook(the men in the accompanying video are not from the UVA chapter, as far as I can tell):
For she is the sweetheart of Phi Kappa Psi,
The girl of all girls most dear;
Hers is the love that will never, never die,
Thru the fortunes and sorrows that come with the years.
Her eyes speak of promise, most tender and true,
Of happiness soon to be,
For theres coming a day
When each Phi Psi sails away
With his sweetheart in Phi Kappa Psi.
Yeah. So, Jackie was led intoa gang-rape ambush. Rolling Stone reports:
She remembers every moment of the next three hours of agony, during which, she says, seven men took turns raping her, while two more  her date, Drew, and another man  gave instruction and encouragement. She remembers how the spectators swigged beers, and how they called each other nicknames like Armpit and Blanket. She remembers the mens heft and their sour reek of alcohol mixed with the pungency of marijuana. Most of all, Jackie remembers the pain and the pounding that went on and on.
And then, after she escaped:
Minutes later, her three best friends on campus  two boys and a girl (whose names are changed)  arrived to find Jackie on a nearby street corner, shaking. What did they do to you? What did they make you do? Jackie recalls her friend Randall demanding. Jackie shook her head and began to cry. The group looked at one another in a panic. They all knew about Jackies date; the Phi Kappa Psi house loomed behind them. We have to get her to the hospital, Randall said.
Their other two friends, however, werent convinced. Is that such a good idea? she recalls Cindy asking. Her reputation will beshotfor the next four years. Andy seconded the opinion, adding that since he and Randall both planned to rush fraternities, they ought to think this through. The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackies rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep. Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: Shes gonna be the girl who cried rape, and well never be allowed into any frat party again.
The Rolling Stone story reveals a campus culture in which fraternity houses are widely known as places where girls, especially freshman girls (who are too young to get into bars) are invited inside, gotten drunk, and bedded. The story says most of the sex is consensual, but sexual predators flourish among the general culture of booze and sex within the frat houses. Heres the most appalling thing about the UVA story: the colleges administration and many of its alumni defend this culture, either passively or actively.
Throughout the story, you read over and over that the UVA administration refused to make anyone available to answer the reporters completely legitimate queries about what happened to Jackie and other women at the school. Get this: when Jackie went to the dean in charge of handling sexual assault claims (a woman, incidentally), she gave Jackie the choice of calling the cops or letting the university handle it:
Like many schools, UVA has taken to emphasizing that in matters of sexual assault, it caters to victim choice. If students feel that we are forcing them into a criminal or disciplinary process that they dont want to be part of, frankly, wed be concerned that we would get fewer reports, says associate VP for student affairs Susan Davis. Which in theory makes sense: Being forced into an unwanted choice is a sensitive point for the victims. But in practice, that utter lack of guidance can be counterproductive to a 19-year-old so traumatized as Jackie was that she was contemplating suicide. Setting aside for a moment the absurdity of a school offering to handle the investigation and adjudication of a felony sex crime  something Title IX requires, but whichnouniversity on Earth is equipped to do  the sheer menu of choices, paired with the reassurance that any choice is the right one, often has the end result of coddling the victim into doing nothing.
This is what the Catholic Church did. The first case I wrote about, back in 2001, involved an immigrant teenager who was passed around priests in a Bronx parish. When the boys father learned what happened, he went to see an auxiliary bishop. According to the victims lawyer, the auxiliary bishop allegedly pulled out a checkbook and offered a payout in exchange for the father signing a paper giving the Archdiocese of New Yorks attorneys the right to handle his case. The father may have been a laborer and an immigrant, but he knew a scam when he saw it. He left and hired his own lawyer.
And here we see the University of Virginia following a similar script. The deeper you read into the story, the more clear it is that the University of Virginias administration has been absolutely and disgustingly derelict for decades, protecting the reputation of the institution at all costs. Excerpt:
If Seccuros story of administrative cover-up and apathy sounds outrageous, its actually in keeping with the stories told by other UVA survivors. After one alumna was abducted from a dark, wooded section of campus and raped in 1993, she says she asked a UVA administrator for better lighting. They told me it would ruin Jeffersons vision of what the university was supposed to look like, the alum says. As if Thomas Jefferson even knew about electric lights! In 2002 and 2004, two female students, including Susan Russells daughter, were unhappy with their sexual-misconduct hearings, which each felt didnt hold their alleged perpetrators accountable  and each was admonished by UVA administrators to never speak publicly about the proceedings or else they could face expulsion for violating the honor code. For issuing that directive, in 2008 UVA was found in violation of the Clery Act.
Please do read the entire Rolling Stone article.It is no more credible to believe that this phenomenon is isolated to the University of Virginia than it is to believe that clerical sexual abuse was limited to the Archdiocese of Boston. I hope Brad Wilcox is right, and this sparks a nationwide series of newspaper investigations into fraternity rapes and the responses of universities.
By the way, the University of Virginia was finally shamed into action by the RS piece. UVAs president Teresa Sullivan has temporarily suspended all fraternity activity on campus.Youll note in the RS story that many of these UVA administrators are women.
I dont understand the attraction of college Greek life. I will strongly discourage my children  not just my daughter, but my sons  from getting involved with it in any way. Too rapey. I do not want my kids, as college students, to be subject to rape, to participate in rape, or to be in a position in which they are pressured to prove their loyalty to their fraternity, their friends, and their university by staying silent about rape.
I was never involved with a fraternity when I was an undergrad, and never partied at a frat house. It is unjust and inaccurate to say that all fraternity brothers are like the men in this story. But when I think back to how getting drunk was a regular part of campus life for both Greek and non-Greek (including Your Working Boy, for sure) when I was at LSU (this was the 1980s, when it was legal for 18 year olds to drink), it is very, very easy to imagine the same kind of thing that happened at UVA happening at my college, and many others. To be clear: I dont know that it did, or does, but boy, does the Rolling Stone description of the drunken scene outside UVA frat houses, especially during Rush Week, sound familiar.
In other news of powerful men getting away with raping drunk or drugged women, more and more women are emerging with allegations that Bill Cosby attacked them. The Washington Post had a long, brutal story about this yesterday.By the time this is over, there wont be anything left of Cosby. If even a fraction of these stories are true, then good; let justice come down on Cosby, on UVA, and on all who have victimized the weak and gotten away with it.

The American Conservative,C,RIP The New Republic | The American Conservative,"Thats probably it for TNR. It was an interesting and intermittently great 100 years.
 Jacob Weisberg (@jacobwe) December 4, 2014
Thats really all there is to say about the news that Frank Foer and Leon Wieseltier  Leon Freaking Wieseltier, a name thats synonymous with The New Republic itself  have been cashiered (or cashiered themselves) by Chris Hughes, the Facebook dude who bought the magazine. Of course theres a lot more to say about it, but its hard to imagine an epitaph quite like that tweet from former TNR staffer Weisberg.
Oh, wait, heres a great one:
TNR owner Chris Hughes just traded Frank Foer and Leon Freakin Wieseltier for an editor that used to work at Gawker. Nice work, champ.
 Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) December 4, 2014
(And now for some unkind gloating: Frank Foer greeted the debut of TAC with a TNR essay calling Buchanans Surefire Flop. Well, were still here; where he? This is a good time to remind fans of The American Conservative to remember us in your end-of-year giving. Two generous donors have agreed to match all the gifts TAC receives through December 31, up to $20,000  so your tax-exempt donation goes twice as far. Donate here, or be responsible for the first Larison Listicle, if it comes to that.)
TNR is moving to New York City, and will concentrate on being clickbaity, following the strategy of Hughes, who is thirty years old, and the ex-Yahoo! manager he hired to run the venerable magazine, which is now going to focus on being a digital media company. Okay, but the magazines digital media companys journalistic credibility is collapsing in real time. Look:
Dear @TNR and @chrishughes, please immediately remove me from your masthead as a Contributing Editor. http://t.co/au7HNKDvoq
 Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) December 4, 2014
Yair Rosenberg, quoting an unnamed source inside the magazine, reports that nearly the entire staff of senior editors and contributing editors is gearing up to quit.
This makes me think of the freakout among the media and cultural elite when Tina Brown took over the New Yorker back in 1992. At the magazine, 24writers resigned or retired.And you know what? Tina Brown, for all her many faults, revived the magazine, and made it breathe again.
Somehow, this does not feel like a Tina Brown moment for TNR.
I share the shock and frustration of many Washington and New York writers and editors over the death of TNR, but lets remember that TNRs kind of journalism doesnt pay for itself. Magazines like TNR  and TAC  survive thanks to the generosity of donors, or the deep pockets of very rich owners. Whats distressing is that the rich kid who bought one of the most respected titles in American political and cultural journalism has used his millions to destroy it. Its like buying Carnegie Hall and turning it into a Dave & Busters. The digital economy needs to produce a better quality of ultrawealthy philanthropist.
UPDATE: Read every word of Jonathan Chaits eulogy for TNR. Excerpt:
I expect the circumstances surrounding TNRs transformation will be framed as a matter of modernity versus tradition. There is certainly an element of this. At the magazines 100th anniversary gala two weeks ago, where Hughes, Foer, Wieseltier, and Hughess new CEO, Guy Vidra, all spoke, the speeches took a sharply, awkwardly divergent tone. Foer and Weiseltier gave soaring paeans to the magazines immense role in shaping American liberal thought. Hughes and Vidra used words likebrandand boasted about page views, giving no sense of appreciation at all for the magazines place in American life. In a comic moment, Vidra mispronounced Foers name. I happened to run into Wieseltier a few days after the gala, and when he asked me what I thought, I told him he and Foer won the debate.
But the conflict between Hughes and most of the staff ofThe New Republicis not about technology. Foer and the staff, with the exception of Wieseltier, are comfortable with modernity. They are joyous bloggers, and willingly submitted to the introduction of cringe-worthy Upworthy headlines to their stories and other compromises one must make with commercial needs.
The problem, rather, is that Hughes and Vidra are afflicted with the belief that they can copy the formula that transformed the Huffington Post and BuzzFeed into economic successes, which is probably wrong, and that this formula can be applied toThe New Republic,which is certainly wrong.
UPDATE.2: Alan Jacobs has a strong remembrance. Excerpts:
If you hear anyone say, Good grief,The New Republicisnt dead, its just moving to New York and transitioning from being a magazine to being avertically integrated digital media company you can safely ignore that person.The New Republicis dead and Chris Hughes killed it. You can rejoice in that fact, lament it, feel nothing; butit remains a fact.
But those long essay-reviews that Wieseltier ran remained a model for much of my own periodical writing. Even when they were wrong, or widely considered wrong, they were confident, expansive, audacious in the scope of their claims: think of Wieseltiers owninfamous hatchet-job on Cornel West, or Martha Nussbaumsincisive (I say) demolition of Judith Butler, or Ruth Franklins nuanced and complexreading of Jonathan LittellsThe Kindly Ones.
I first came to Washington in the fall of 1988, as an intern with a political consultancy. Thats when I discovered TNR, which was then in its Michael Kinsley heyday. It was a glorious magazine, I thought, and I devoured each issue. Im not sure when I lost touch with it; probably when I left DC in 1995 and moved to Florida to write about movies. In 1999, when I was living in New York and had begun to write about politics more often, I went back to it every now and then, but it just wasnt the same.
Im honestly not sure if the magazine that died today is the same magazine whose demise I mourn, because I havent read it other than the occasional web piece for years now. I do wonder, though, what responsibility I and people like me have for the collapse of magazines like TNR. If enough people had subscribed to it, perhaps it wouldnt have fallen into the hands of the rich young boob who destroyed it. Its too late now, but there are plenty more of us not-for-profit opinion magazines out there who would very much appreciate your subscription  oryour tax-deductible donation.
I am especially appreciative of the TAC donors in my readership who arent conservatives, but who give because they want to preserve our voice on the Right, and in the public square. I need to pay this forward by finding a left-of-center magazine whose voice I appreciate, even if I disagree with its editorial line, and buy a subscription. And I need to re-up my lapsed subscriptions to magazines on the Right. I have so little time to read now that they sometimes pile up, which leads to my forgetting to renew them. But supporting little magazines is important for reasons beyond the information you find in their pages or pixels. The world without The New Republic shows why.

The American Conservative,C,Bringing Back Husbandry | The American Conservative,"Americas agrarian culture is suffering. Todays average farmer or rancher is 58 years old, and on the verge of retirement. Whereas in 1840, almost 70 percent of our labor force worked in agriculture, a mere two percent were doing so in 2000. Most farm operators depend on outside income in order to surviveand In just five years,notesVox, The US experienced a net loss of 90,000 farms.
Yet Forrest Pritchardowner of Smith Meadows Farm and author ofGaining Ground: A Story of Farmers Markets, Local Food, and Saving the Family Farmsays theres never been a better time to get into farming.Pritchard published Gaining Groundlast year, and has already garnered considerable acclaim in the agrarian community. Modern Farmer profiled his book in July 2013.He now travels regularly, speaking at conferences and talking about his farm.
Gaining Ground presented a different face to the sustainable farming movement: Smith Meadows Farm has been in Pritchards family for seven generations, but was steadily losing money. In 1996, I returned from college to my familys farm and found it in complete shambles, he writes. My parents had given up on ever making a profit from farming, and had taken jobs in the city to make ends meet. The land didnt generate enough profit for us to even buy our own food. Our family farm, just like thousands of others across the country, was undeniably broken.
Pritchards book isnt really a story of entrepreneurial innovation (like Joel Salatins works), nor is it representative of the boutique farming that has recently come into vogue. His story is one of renewal, of bringing a dying family farm back to life.

After parking by the farm store, Pritchard greets me with a firm handshake and begins his tour of the farm.Pritchard is a meat farmer, and regularly rotates cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, and turkeys to fresh paddocks of grass. The livestock are never fed animal by-products or given growth hormones or antibiotics.
While we walk over to where the cows are pasturing, I ask Pritchard if he ever intends to expand his enterpriseto grow produce, say, or to sell dairy products. He would rather focus on being a meat farmer, he says. Its not just that he can barter and trade for all the produce he needs at weekend farmers markets; he also wants to keep improving the quality of his current enterprise. You can spend your entire life just focusing on raising one breed of cattle, he notes.
While the farm has grown considerably over time, Pritchard says hes learned to say noto limit his farm to what its capable of producing, and to not stretch himself (or his land) too far.While many farmers have felt pressure to specialize and industrialize their productions in order to turn a profit, Pritchard takes a longer viewnoting that, at his current size and productivity levels, he has built a successful customer base, is garnering a profit, and is still keeping his land healthy.
Pritchard then reminds me of the difference in the air. I realize that, surrounded by animals usually associated with pungent odors of excrement, I can barely smell their presence. This, Pritchard notes, is one of the most noticeable differences between grass-fed livestock and their industrially-farmed counterparts. Livestock who are out grazing all day dont leave the same pungent odors. On thisfarm, all you can smell is fresh air and grass.
Pritchard believes industrialized methods have changed more than just the smell of a farm, however. They have also had a markedly deleterious impacton the next generation of agrarians. For 50 to 60 years, Pritchard says, weve done a great job of creating inexpensive food abundance, and decreasing quality of life and satisfaction [for farmers and their families]. Kids who grew up beside manure lagoons and spray houses, who saw their parents scraping to get by, barely turning a profit,have no desire to inherit such an enterprise. Who wants to sign up for that? Pritchard asks.
In order to savehis family farm, Pritchard has worked hard to make a normal business structure, where you get a return on business. You gotta make a profit. Pritchard also notes that hes careful not to put too much pressure on his son, who is still quite young, to follow in his footsteps. A childhood is an important thing to have, he says. I dont want him to feel forced from a young age. Pritchard himself remembers having a delightful childhood on this very farm, having the ability to roam and explore even amidst chores and schoolwork. He wants to make sure his son has the same experiences, so that he will associate this farm with joy and love, not merely drudgery and duty. This balance of involvement and freedom, exploration and responsibility, creates a deep impact.

After his tour of the chickens and turkeys, Pritchard shows me the pigs, grazing in the back area of the property. As the pigs nibble at my boots,Pritchard tells me that an apprentice once bemoaned the harmful effect they seemed to have on the land. Their fierce appetites turn all green things into piles of mud. But appearances are deceiving: once the pigs have moved on and the soil has rested, plants grow back more lush than ever.
Pritchard crouches down in the dirt and pushes away a clump of trampled sod with his hands. Not all patches of land are as perfect as this, he says, but this is what were aiming for.Beneath the soda natural covering of trampled grass, due to the activity of animals on the propertyare loose, lush clumps of earth. The soil is black and moist, and even in November, sprouts of new grass are pushing up out of the ground.This is new life, Pritchard says. It just takes time to see it.
Pritchard considers himself a soil farmer as much as a meat farmer. As the title of his book suggests, Smith Meadows farm really is an enterprise focused on gaining ground, replenishing and renewing earth that has suffered for centuries, due to chemicals and overwork. With time and careful diligence, Pritchard is trying to reverse the soil depletion of generations past. And he gets as excited about this as he does the beef and chickens that roam the property.
Theres a beautiful longevity to this fixation on the soil. Unlike the consumeristic approach of many farmers, who steadily deplete the health of the soil through overwork and undernourishment, Pritchard is adamant about maintaining the health of the dirt itself.Of course it makes sense that tending the soil will eventually result in a myriad of benefits for Pritchard. His livestock will continue to have lush grass, which will in turn result in their health and future profitability.
But Pritchard is also dedicated to a generational view of farming, and wants this farm to reach its eighth generation of stewardship. It is exactly this sort of generational methodology that encourages farmers to seek the good of their ground, no matter the short-term challenges or difficulties. If a certain piece of property needs to rest for several months (as property grazed by pigs must), Pritchard sets it aside readily. He is looking to the future, and knows that rest is a necessary gift, to the land and to himself.
As Pritchard put it in his interview withModern Farmer,
I think theres probably a bit of a difference between a first-generation person who is very interested in wanting to farm maybe for philosophical reasons, or maybe because they think its a sound business decision and farmers who have been born into the land and have been surrounded by fields and forests and streams and all these things. You have a real sense of stewardship that becomes a multi-generational perspective if its not about one farmer. Its about the generation before and the generation that comes afterwards.
Wendell Berry has pointed this out in countless essays: to him, it illustrates an important difference between modern farming and the classical concept of husbandry. Husbandry is about a more loving, devoted, selfless care than most modern farmers exhibit. Its about cultivating a holistic health, in soil and land, that transcends profit. Husbandry, writes Berry, is the name of all the practices that sustain life by connecting us conservingly to our places and our world; it is the art of keeping tied all the strands in the living network that sustains us. (Renewing Husbandry, 2004.)By making agriculture into a science and an industry, rather than a domestic and familial vocation, we have lost an appreciation for holistic flourishing. The modern farm is understood as a surface on which various mechanical operations are performed, and to which various chemicals are applied, writes Berry. The under-surface reality of organisms and roots is mostly ignored.
But soil husbandry, that appreciation of the land which includes conscientious care for its earth, leads to true health. As Berry writes in his 2006 essay, On the Soil and Health, The soil has living creatures in it. It has live roots in it, perennial roots if it is lucky. If it is the soil of the right kind of farm, it has a farm family growing out of it.

Pritchard finishes his tour of the farm, and we head back to the farm store. The store works entirely on an honor system: people grab the products they want from the meat freezer, and then put their payment in a money box before they leave.
We sit on the front porch, and Pritchard talks about his hopes for the future.Though he wasnt originally interested in outreach, he now sees speaking and writing as his way of giving back.
Every farmer is deeply interested in holding onto their farm, he says. Their biggest challenge is getting on board with the changing narrative of their story. As consumers seek out more organic, sustainably farmed products, some farmers are hesitant to absorb the practices, seeing them as merely trendy.
But Pritchard combats this idea with a vehemence. He believes that organic, sustainable farming isnt trendy, its ancient, multi-generational, and multi-ethnic. Indeed, hes written a new book on the subject, which will be released in September 2015. In it, Pritchard interviews 18 different farmers from around the U.S., sharing their stories and recipes.
Pritchard hopes this book will reach the next generation of farmers. Im worried about the 20-year-olds, he says. Though many young up-and-coming farmers are enthusiastic about organic methodologies, they arent fluent in the business know-how necessary to maintain a farm. You gotta combine sustainability with economics, Pritchard says. You gotta make a profit.
But Pritchard sees the new opportunities provided by social media and burgeoning farmers markets. He sees the rise of CSAs (community-supported agriculture), Whole Foods, and even some middle-man companies (like From the Farmer DC), helping connect consumers with local farms. He sees the popularity of the locavore movement, and his own eager base of customers. And he tells me that farmers today have a colossal opportunity to succeed. Havinglived both sides of it, Pritchard sees a bright future for Smith Meadows Farmand for sustainable agriculture.

The American Conservative,C,Is Clickbait the End of Online News? | The American Conservative,"Recently, clickbait has become one of the most frequently lobbed pejoratives on the Internet, but what does it mean exactly? Many might point to Buzzfeed as the quintessential culprit, with enticingly-titled articles under large yellow tags like LOL, omg, cute, wtf, etc.; but editor-in-chief Ben Smith insists those accusations simply arent true, claiming that their attention-grabbing headlines dont promise more than they deliver and therefore arent clickbait. The Atlantics James Hamblin ponders his claim and mulls on how best to define the phenomenon:
BuzzFeedis great at delivering on the curiosity it creates, but its misleading to say that it doesnt rely on curiosity gaps. Great journalism at every point on the information-entertainment spectrum has long relied on curiosity to draw people into a story that they otherwise wouldnt care about.
Hamblin ultimately concludes that making clickbaiting a sin unique to Buzzfeed isnt fair, as every headline and story competes for attention, with varying amounts of honesty in advertising:
the market demand goes well beyond only the topics that lend themselves toneedingto be told.
Maybe thats the best definition then, of clickbait: Did this post need to exist, or did you just make a thing for the sake of making a thing? In which case, BuzzFeeddoes Clickbait. So does pretty much everyone.
Thus, all article-headline pairings fall on a spectrum ranging from more to less manipulative. Online audiences are understandably upset by this trend of false advertising, or even just by the sinking feeling of being duped as they instinctively click on a pointless (yet interesting) article. But the sheer bulk of viral news options creates odd pressures on online news: traditional news cant always depend on competitive traffic rates, and many websites are essentially stuck feeling they must be as flashy as their competitors. Eventually, everything starts to look and sound a little like Buzzfeed.
Its an understandably depressing phenomenon to those who love the professionalism and respectability of traditional media. For example, longtime readers of Time magazine who subscribe to the publications Facebook feed are undoubtedly surprised when they are barraged with stories like There Was an Entire Category About Beyonc on Jeopardy Last Night and Kim Kardashians Butt Might Just Break the Internet Today. Does this signal a decline in journalism?
Hamblin is not so pessimistic:
Among cynical readers given to labeling everything clickbait, there seems to be an assumption that editors and writers live and die by the number of clicks they generate.Thats rarely true, and only less so as sites move away from banner ads and find better ways of monetizing based on the quality of content rather than the quantity of people exposed. That bodes well for the readers who prefer only-publish-what-we-really-love kinds of sites to high-output hit-or-miss content mills. Some call it the Slow Web movement, or simply the dream.
The Slow Web concept is encouraging in an age obsessed with newness and loudness. If Buzzfeed and its kind are the checkout-stand tabloids of the Internet, websites operating within the Slow Web ideal are the newspapers, and their regular readers are subscribers.
For instance, compare Buzzfeed to Mallory Ortberg and Nicole Cliffes The Toast. This website is about as niche as can be, with articles almost exclusively centered on humorist, feminist interpretations of art, cultural, and literary history. Sure, the Toasts content (entertaining as it may be) appeals to a tiny fraction of web trafficbut to the editors, thats fine. The Toast has its place on the Internet, and it has carved out that space without desperately bidding for universal appeal via clickbait.
In the case of news websites, theres an element of boring that understandably must persist. We cant all be humorists, after all. But news websites can still deliberately craft an online brand that reflects grace, thoughtfulness, and professionalism. The sad online face of Time pales in comparison to the contemplative news space at Hamblins own Atlantic. News services attempting to cater to everyone on the Internet are drawn inexorably towards the lowest common denominatorand at the end of the day, thats not what anyone wants.

The American Conservative,C,The Moral Path to Peace | The American Conservative,"Humanity faces no greater challenge in the 21st century than averting conflict among peoples and civilizations. It is curious and revealing that experts in international relations and political science generally seem not to be beyond themselves with worry that this century might see the war that will make all previous wars look minor. A deteriorating relationship between China and the United States and more arrogance and obduracy in the Middle East are but the most obvious possible sources of a great conflagration.
Superficiality in defining the dangers or delay in addressing them could have horrendous consequences. Yet discussions of how to minimize conflict typically neglect what may be the most important part of the problem. In the West particularly, it is common to assume that general enlightenment will remove obstacles to peacethis despite the fact that we need only look to the century preceding this one, the most murderous and inhumane in all of history, to recognize that the spread of supposedly sophisticated ideas and science does not reduce the intemperance, belligerence, or cruelty of human beings. It only provides them with new means of asserting their will.
Many in the West expect that certain political and economic arrangements will promote peacedemocracy and markets being perhaps the most popular at the moment. They think that universal suffrage and economic interdependence will be salutary. Many hope that international agreements and increasing the influence of the United Nations will keep the peace. Behind some prescriptions for lessening tension there lingers a sentimental notion of the brotherhood of man. As fellow human beings, cant we just hug? Meanwhile, those who consider themselves more realistic favor balance-of-power theorizing.
But most attempts to deal with conflict do not deal in any depth with what may be the very core of the problem, mans moral predicament. Proceeding from a dubious or incomplete understanding of the basic moral terms of human existence, scholars and others exaggerate what elaborate, clever international arrangements or techniques can do to lessen tension. The trouble is that when passions run high even the most efficacious measures can be swept away in the blink of an eye. In fraught, very tense circumstances peace will have a chance only if the actors involved are not only experienced, knowledgeable, and creative, but capable of withstanding, in themselves as well as others, the onrush of rashness, belligerence, and ethnic-nationalistic fervor. Such urges can be tamed in the end only by strong character, including habits of restraint and caution. You want peace? Then you need peaceful individuals.
Yet the subject that may be most important seems largely alien to the Western intellectual elites. I have in mind the moral and cultural preconditions of peace. They are crucial, first, because efforts to avoid conflict are likely to be unsuccessful unless those involved have a certain kind of will and imagination, second, because the relative importance of other aspects of how to deal with conflict are best assessed in light of the most complete view of what makes human beings tick. That the subject of the moral and cultural preconditions of peace receives far less attention than other topics seems a sign that Western intellectuals may not be well equipped to deal with the most pressing problem of the new century. Upbringing and education in the West may have to be significantly revised.
In exploring the issue of morality we must, partly because we find ourselves in a globalizing age, guard against intellectual provincialism, presentism, and other myopia. We need to repair to the historical experience of mankind. We should be willing, at minimum, to question the prevalent view of modern Western intellectuals that moral values are merely subjective or that moral beliefs are just the idiosyncratic creatures of historical circumstance. If we think more historically and internationally, a different possibility emerges. Amidst a wide variety of beliefs in the human past and present the open-minded scholar finds what looks like a shared, if variously expressed, sense of higher values, a universal dimension. The ancient Greeks called these values the good, the true, and the beautiful. The great moral and religious systems give primacy to the good, that is, to moral universality. In these traditions ecumenical research finds far-reaching transcultural and transhistorical agreement on what is the central moral problem of human existence: that the human will is cleft between higher and lower potentialities and man is his own worst enemy.
National arrogance and economic ruthlessness are among the obvious and palpable threats to international harmony, but they are but instances of the more general danger that societies and their leaders, instead of interacting on the level of what is morally, aesthetically and intellectually noblest in each, will interact at their worst, when most self-absorbed, grasping, and intense. Enlightened self-interest, as opposed to crude, short-sighted self-interest, can go a long way towards keeping competing parties from clashing, but a mere coincidence of partisan wills provides no stable and lasting basis for peace. That popular Western culture is today spreading around the world creates a commonality of sorts, but it is a fragile, very questionable likemindedness. This popular culture is almost uniformly disdainful of the moral and cultural traditions of mankind, including those of the Western world, and is perceived by many as a threat to their most deeply held beliefs. Because of its crudities and vulgarities it antagonizes rather than appeals to the more discerning and discriminating representatives of the peoples of the world.
No observation would seem to be more richly confirmed by the historical record than that human beings are morally cleft, to the core, between higher and lower potentialities. Yet this crux of the human predicament is strangely denied or ignored in most Western attempts today to find a way to harmonious and just arrangements. One thinks, for example, of the long-influential moral rationalism of a John Rawls, with its propensity for wholly ahistorical ratiocination. The Rawls who was widely celebrated would have human beings step behind the veil of ignorance and consider policies without regard to how they might affect them personally. Reasonableness would then preside over deliberation, and justice and harmony would be served.
The same fondness for abstract theorizing and reluctance to think historically and concretely marks theories of communicative or deliberative democracy. Sound policy and harmony are expected to emerge from never-ending conversation that excludes no legitimate groups. There is something very abstract and even dream-like about these theories. They assume what must not be assumed, that human beings are interested in listening to competing views. They are not. They want their own way. They think of opposition as annoying and as something to be overcome. What these theorists do not quite realize is that when people do show a genuine willingness to consider the ideas of others, it is because they have learnt to control the passions that would close them down intellectually.
Openness of mind presupposes a special, rather sturdy moral self-discipline and habituation. The framers of the U.S. Constitution set up a system that would encourage debate and compromise. Americans would be governed by their deliberate sense. But the framers were acutely aware that for this system to work those active within it would have to be capable of self-restraint and be willing to respect the views of others. Their system had demanding moral and cultural preconditions. A certain character typeI like to call it the constitutional personalityhad to be available if genuine deliberation were to take place.
More recent theorizing about how to achieve communication and harmony does not explore in depth how to create the moral and cultural conditions favorable to deliberation, dispassionate judgment, and compromise. Exhibiting ahistorical and sentimental leanings, todays theorists simply assume that when people operate in a more progressive, egalitarian setting they will be spontaneously predisposed to reasonableness and to hearing the arguments of others. This is wishful thinking. Theories of this abstract, rather dreamy type have limited value in discussions of domestic politics, and they are wholly inadequate for international relations. There is need for a more realistic, robust understanding of the real sources of open-mindedness and civilized conduct.
In the end, only moral character, supported by general culture, can fortify the self in man that wants openness to argument and respect for others. It used to be regarded as the central purpose of civilization to assist individuals in reining in their least admirable traits so that more admirable ones could be developed. Only protracted moral and cultural exertions and habituation, encouraged by the surrounding society, bring forth people of this kind. In proportion as the people of a society fall short, they undermine not only their own well-being and the cohesion of their society but also international relations.
Until fairly recently, it was taken for granted by most in the Western world, as it was in the East, that human beings are torn between desires that enhance existence and ones that, though they may bring short-term pleasure, are destructive of a deeper meaning and are potentially diabolical. To realize what the ancient Greeks called eudaimonia, happiness, a person must learn to discipline his appetites of the moment, try to extinguish some of them, with a view to his own enduring higher good. Happiness does not refer to a maximization of pleasure but to the special sense of well-being and self-respect that attends living nobly and responsibly. It is for the sake of this higher life that a person foregoes momentary pleasures and advantages.
The good life has many aspects and prerequisitesmoral, intellectual, aesthetic, political, and economicbut there was widespread agreement in the old Western society, whether Greek, Roman, or Christian, that realizing lifes higher potential ultimately depends on the persons character and quality of will. A person who lacks the strength to act rightly cannot achieve happiness by dint of intellectual brilliance, imaginative power, or economic productivity.
According to the old Western tradition and corresponding traditions in the East, society should encourage the kind of working on self that will build meaning and worth into personal and social existence. Whether the goal is the happiness and nobility of a worldly life of the kind that Aristotle and Confucius advocate or the special peace of holiness in which religion culminates, there is no substitute for the protracted, often difficult effort of will.
Note carefully that the most important measure of progress is the quality of actions performed. I am the way and the truth and the life, said Jesus of Nazareth. The statement implies that its validity could be tested only in practical action. In Buddhism, the right Way is the diligent working on self to extinguish needless or destructive desire. In the Dhammapada, which is attributed in its general spirit to the Buddha, we read about the path to Nirvana: You yourself must make an effort.
In the West, the most radical and influential challenge to this view of mans moral predicament came from Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). Rousseau was, among other things, the main intellectual inspiration for the French Jacobins, who spearheaded the French Revolution that started in 1789. For Rousseau, the old view of human nature is profoundly mistaken. Man is not chronically torn between good and evil. There are in mans own nature no lower inclinations, certainly no original sin, as Christianity alleges. Man was born good. In his primitive, presocial, natural state, man was pure, simple, peaceful, and happy, and that remains his nature. The evil in society is due not to some perversity in man but to perverse norms, habits, and institutions. Destroy that society, and mans goodness will be released.
Rousseau and his many followers pioneered a revolution in the understanding of morality that continues to reverberate. Virtue ceased to be a matter of character and right willing. It became primarily a state of feeling and imagination, an attribute of the heart. Rousseau gave prominence to tearful empathy, pity, as a sign of human nobility. The old measure of moral virtue was loving, responsible action. Good conduct was the outgrowth of sometimes painful self-scrutiny and a diligent working on self. But for Rousseau man was good by nature, so there was no need for man to be on guard against his own lower impulses. Neither was there any need for traditions, social groups, or institutions to buttress morality. On the contrary, it was by liberating man from such traditional constraints that natural goodness would reassert itself. Rousseau and his followers shifted the central struggle of human existence from the inner life of persons to the social and political arena, where the virtuous had to defeat evil forces.
Rousseaus redefinition of morality, which by itself had a profound influence in the modern Western world, coincided historically with the kind of rationalism that seized the initiative with the Enlightenment. Its conception of reason was heavily slanted in the direction of mathematics, geometry, and natural science. Representatives of the Enlightenment rejected the traditional view of man as superstitious and unscientific. They had no place for ancient moral wisdom. A happy life was not dependent on moral character but required a fundamental restructuring of society according to enlightened ideas.
Rousseauistic sentimentality and Enlightenment rationalism might seem to be wholly different approaches to life, but they became close and frequent allies. Both belittled the need for moral character. Selfishness, ruthlessness, avarice, and conflict were not due to any chronic human weakness but could be overcome by remaking the social and political exterior. Sentimental idealism and rationalism came together in social engineering, dreamy idealistic visions of the future providing the goal and technocratic manipulation providing the method. In the area of international relations, sentimental virtue and technocratic thinking eventually combined in the idea of an enlightened and vaguely egalitarian global culture, often summarized in the term democracy. According to this ideology, the historically evolved characteristics of peoples, societies, and civilizations will soon give way to a proper transnational ideological homogeneity. History will end.
This notion of emerging global harmony neglects the central issue of moral character. Equally troublesome is the presumption that persons, societies, and civilizations should give up their traditional distinctiveness. Let me suggest, to the contrary, that what might actually be the most conducive to cordial relations is to cherishnot disdainhistorically evolved identities, though to cherish them in a particular manner. It is not contradictory or even paradoxical to view this respect for historical particularity as a kind of cosmopolitanism. It is a cosmopolitanism that would encourage particular persons, societies, and civilizations to be themselves while living up to their own highest standards.The cosmopolitanism I have in mind affirms both cultural distinctiveness and pan-cultural unity, which it can do because each is anchored in a similar moral and cultural striving. In order to assist peace, political, economic, scientific, and other efforts to reduce conflict must be informed by moral realism, most especially by a recognition of the need for leaders to have self-control and a corresponding cultural sensibility. I call this approach to peace cosmopolitan humanism.
I hasten to add what should be obvious, that sometimes cultural diversity expresses provincialism, intolerance, and brutality and is a major source of conflict. Diversity that is not humanized by moral and other universality but manifests self-absorbed eccentricity engenders friction and instability. Nationalistic arrogance and bullying caused terrible upheaval and suffering in the last two centuries. The great problem with what is ordinarily called multiculturalism is that it is quite unable to distinguish between diversity that enriches and diversity that degrades human life.
The history and culture of a people is the source of its social cohesion, outlook on life, and sense of direction and self-worth. Its past shapes it in countless ways, some of which are not even visible to the superficial eye. Every people has less than admirable traits of which it would do well to try to divest itself, but it also has admirable qualities and great achievements in which it can take pride. These must be absorbed and appreciated anew by each generation. Efforts in the present to improve society need to be adapted, through creativity, to the historically evolved cultural heritage. A people cannot give its best without being itself. To impose on a people a supposedly superior pattern of conduct that is wholly alien to its traditions produces disorientation and a split personality: the alien patterns can only produce mechanical and artificial imitation, while putting the people at odds with its deepest sources of self-respect and meaning.
When people in different societies develop what is most admirable in their culture, however, they may at one and the same time be cultivating their own heritage and a common human ground, to the extent that their work is inspired by the universal values of goodness, truth, and beauty. As they culturally enrich their own society, they strengthen their ties to other peoples. Though inevitably marked by the distinctive past and present of their particular society, their cultural efforts are in their expression of mans higher humanity a bridge to equivalent attempts in other societies.
Genuine human universality has nothing to do with uniformity. It consists of universal qualities that are always adapted to the historical circumstance of time and place. This is done by means of human creativity that synthesizes the universal and the particular. Cosmopolitan humanism is based on the recognition that many different, historically formed cultural identities and individual creative acts can manifest one and the same higher quality of inspirationthough obviously more or less successfully in particular cases. Representatives of different cultures can come together as fellow human beings not despite but through their cultural individualities, the latter sharing not all particulars but the same quality. 
Cosmopolitan humanism, then, simultaneously and indistinguishably cherishes the unity of purpose that is intrinsic to pursuing lifes higher values and the diversity that must characterize attempts to realize that potential.Moral and cultural activity at their best affirm the unity by harmonizing and dignifying the diversity and affirm the diversity by varying and enriching the unity.This humanizing discipline contrasts sharply with universality that is understood as distinct from and even opposed to particularity and as abstract rather than concrete and particular.
In the Western world especially, it is widely assumed that a culture of enlightenment, democracy, and equality is far along in supplanting the ancient moral and cultural traditions of the world. But supposed progressives seem not to realize the extent to which social and political arrangements that they deem desirable and even take for grantedincluding respect for individual rights, rule of law, freedoms of speech and association, and toleranceactually evolved from the old moral and cultural traditions that progressives deem expendable or unacceptable. Many of their designs for society and the world are parasitic on old character traits that they have no plans for trying to preserve. They want behaviors of a certain kind but do not attend to their moral and cultural preconditions.
If there is any truth about human nature in the ancient moral and religious traditions, the progressive mind ignores or downplays the greatest threat to domestic and international peace: that man is his own worst enemy. This is the case not only, as enlightened intellectuals might concede, in that man is sometimes less than fully rational but also in that he is prone to letting egotistical passion and rashness run roughshod over conscience. Leaders and people who are able to show the appropriate self-restraint are such because they are in the habit of scrutinizing and purifying their own motives. Protracted moral and cultural efforts have shaped their character, limiting the self-indulgence that puts them in conflict with others.
Because historical circumstances vary so greatly, societies are bound to differ in how they approach and express respect for higher values. Yet there is among the ancient civilizations of the world a remarkable confluence of moral and cultural sensibility. It includes far-reaching agreement about what constitutes admirable human conduct and good leadership. From China to Europe and the United States there is a rough consensus on the attributes of a great man or gentleman. He is first of all a person of moral integrity. Of particular relevance in this discussion of prospects for cordial relations is the belief that the exemplary person exhibits self-restraint, humility, modesty, dignity, and good manners. The ancient Greeks warned against hubris, against the belief that you are one of the gods. For Christianity, the greatest sin is pride. Our primary moral obligation is not to condemn the weaknesses of others and demand that they improve but to attend to our own weaknesses. Christianity roundly condemns the conceit and moral evasiveness of always finding fault in others. In the words of Jesus of Nazareth, Take the log out of your own eye first, and then you will be able to see and take the speck outof your brothers eye.
The notion of universality that I associate with cosmopolitan humanism contains no implication that persons, peoples, and civilizations should conform to a single model of life or that universality can be imposed by means of political engineering. It may be helpful to contrast genuine universality with a type of universalism that today is particularly common and influential in the United States. I am referring to an ideologically intense variant of the Enlightenment mindset that assumes a single political system is desirable and even mandatory for all societies and should be everywhere installed, through military means if necessary. I have called this ideology the new Jacobinism. The French Jacobins summarized their putatively universal principles in the slogan freedom, equality, and brotherhood. They saw France as the redeemer of nations. The new Jacobins speak of freedom and democracy, and they have anointed the United States.
It is important to understand how radically that form of universalism departs from the older Western tradition. Although proximate in time, the ideas behind the U.S. Constitution of 1789 and those behind the French Revolution of the same year are fundamentally different. The framers of the Constitution held a view of human nature and society that was essentially classical and Christian, whereas the French Jacobins were inspired by Rousseau.
According to the classical and Christian traditions, moral virtue is indistinguishable from personal character. It is first of all a form of self-rule. It means subduing and ordering the passions. Jacobin virtue, by contrast, is primarily and directly political. It is a sense of moral superiority, of being a benefactor of mankind. Because it thinks of itself as a desire to improve vastly the lives of others, this virtue feels itself entitled to the power needed to change the world. This virtue, then, is not a wish to control and improve self but a wish to control and improve others. Far from curbing the will to power, Jacobin universalism stimulates it.
The U.S. Constitution assumes a need for the opposite, to restrain power, that of the people as well as that of their representatives. Americas leaders were not interested in ideological crusading. They hoped to set a good example for others, not impose their will on them. But the new Jacobins radically re-interpret what they call Americas Founding principles. These principles belong to all mankind, they assert, and they justify armed American global hegemony.
The U.S. Constitution granted to the central government only limited and shared sovereignty. It left power for the most part in state and local institutions and, above all, with the people themselves in their private capacities. The purpose of the constitutional arrangement was unity in diversity. The union of states would help harmonize and draw strength from diversity, not abolish it.
Because neo-Jacobin universalism favors abstract, ideological homogeneity and disdains particularity, it runs counter to old American attitudes and Western traditions. In practice as well as theory, abstract universalism means a lack of respect for regional or local diversity and for the special needs and opportunities that they reflect.
It does not follow that the most common form of modern multiculturalism with its cult of diversity and its so-called historicism offers a humane alternative. By its frantic and therefore disingenuous denial of universality, postmodernism makes history chaotic. Without a unity or continuity of human experience, no consciousness could exist. There could be no history, only wholly disjointed and therefore meaningless experiential fragments. It is different with what I call cosmopolitan humanism. Though it recognizes and affirms the variety of human existence and its inevitably contextual, contingent, historical character, it sees particularity as potentially expressive of universality.
In political theory the school that most sharply attacks historicism is that of Leo Strauss. Interestingly, postmodernism shares with anti-historicist universalism, whether of the Straussian or neo-Jacobin variety, the assumption that universality and particularity are incompatible. The postmodernists attack universality in the name of radical historicity. The anti-historicists disparage historical particularity in the name of ideological universality. Neither side recognizes the possibility of synthesis of universality and particularity, a potential that is central to cosmopolitan humanism.
The dialectical and synthetical relationship of universality and particularity may be suggested in the most general terms. The good, the true, and the beautiful do in one special sense lack specific form: they are magnetic qualities that an infinite number of yet to be completed moral acts, philosophical thoughts, and works of art may have. But in a different sense the good, the true, and the beautiful exist for us only in historical particulars: they are embodied in countless acts, thoughts, and works of artin loving, morally responsible behavior, wise books and lectures, outstanding poems and compositionswhich come alive in the present as we relive and try to absorb them and let them inspire more of the same.
Far from being an ahistorical, abstract standard, genuine universality must be freshly discovered by individuals for themselves in their time and place. It must find expression in concrete particulars. The resulting variety enriches and deepens mans historical existence. Because universality has no other opportunities for articulation than the historical circumstances of persons, it can have no single manifestation, only a single qualitative form. Although true universality creates qualitative affinities across borders, it is inimical to a global uniculture. Goodness, truth, and beauty reveal the common human ground as they show themselves in the uniqueness and distinctiveness of persons, peoples, and civilizations.
This kind of particularity harmonizes diversity. It makes for more than a flimsy and transitory unity. When peoples and civilizations cultivate their selfhood at the highest level, their efforts are not only compatible with unity. They are the unity. To the extent that unity is possible among human beings, it is achieved through diversity.
It should be possible to see, then, why cosmopolitan humanism is indistinguishable from patriotism, that is, from a proper love of ones own society. The genuine patriot, as distinguished from the self-absorbed, arrogant nationalist, cherishes what is admirable about his own traditions, as judged by transnational, universal standards. Without the patriots deep rootedness in his own cultures sense of goodness, truth, and beauty he would not have the preparation and sensitivity to appreciate comparable efforts in other societies. Moral, intellectual, and aesthetic phenomena from around the world that strike rootless, ill-informed, ill-prepared observers as having nothing in common are found by the patriotic cosmopolitan to be both qualitatively kindred and intriguingly, appealingly different.
Cosmopolitan humanism contrasts sharply with the prescriptions for regional or global unification that are advanced by people who have no deep cultural roots and who for that reason are at home in no particular place. For such pseudocosmopolitans no truly common human ground exists and no truly transcultural appreciation is possible. Peace has to them no special moral and cultural preconditions. The dominant breed of Eurocrat exemplifies the type. Just as this person has no strong attachment to any country, so does this person have scant interest in history and even less in the philosophically demanding issues of morality and culture. The typical Eurocrat makes do instead with a smattering of trendy ideas. It is anomalous and potentially dangerous that people with little familiarity with and even a strong prejudice against the moral and cultural traditions of mankind tend to set the tone in discussions of how to achieve better international relations.
A technocratic and presentist cosmopolitanism is not merely ill-conceived, it positively undermines prospects for lessening tensions by diverting attention from what peace and unity most require: that persons, peoples, and civilizations put a resilient check on self-absorption and arrogance and cultivate what is best in their traditions. To stress that need is to make a central philosophical point, but it is first and foremost an urgent call for greater realism in addressing the problem of peace. It is realism in keeping with the shared moral and cultural heritage of humanity.

The American Conservative,C,Deconstructing Western Civilization | The American Conservative,"Damon Linker has a characteristically sharp piece about New York magazines 6000+ interview with an anonymous zoophile  in this case, a man whose fetish involves sex with a horse. Linker connects to my initial blog post about this thing, and shares my revulsion at what the magazine has done, and what it means:
[T]his is a very big deal, in cultural and moral terms.No, not the fact of bestiality, which (like incest) has always been with us, but the fact of an acclaimed, mainstream publication treating it as a matter of complete moral indifference.
As I said in my post, its not that this interview is going to make people heretofore disinclined to copulate with animals change their minds. Its that a piece like this is a canary-in-the-coalmine cultural moment. Linker:
Why, then, is theNew Yorkinterview a big deal? Because its perhaps the most vivid sign yet that, in effect, the United States (and indeed the entire Western world) is running an experiment  one with very few, if any, antecedents in human history. The experiment will test what happens when a culture systematically purges all publicly affirmed notions of human flourishing, virtue and vice,elevation and degradation.
But Linker says there are two problems with my analysis (and with the trad reaction in general).First, he says that we trads are wrong to blame relativism for this, saying that its more accurate to put the fault down to an absolute ethic of niceness, by which he means an increasing refusal to condemn, because that would be mean. I see what hes saying here: its not that people affirm bestiality, but that they refuse to condemn it because hey, if thats someones choice, who am I to judge?
(Of course we know from extensive sociological research that the Millennial generation, at least, can be quite judgmental on a number of topics. But the ones they suspend judgment on are matters of religion, and matters of sexuality. In those cases, niceness reigns.)
I take Damons point, but I think this is a distinction without much of a difference. If niceness is the ethical rule here, then how is that not de facto relativism?
Linkers claim that disgust is not a sound basis for setting moral rules is harder to dismiss. When I was growing up in the 1970s, there were still a number of people who had visceral disgust at the sight of interracial couples. That has abated, thankfully, but its still present in some people. Same deal with gay couples. This is a case in which relativism is an important factor to consider in moral reasoning. It doesnt mean disgust is irrelevant to our moral decisions; disgust can be a good general guide to right and wrong. But it does mean that disgust cannot be dispositive, and that we must look past our reactions of disgust and analyze the moral facts of a situation dispassionately. Seeing an 89-year-old man kissing his 26-year-old wife may prompt feelings of disgust, but it tells us nothing about the morality of an elderly man marrying a much younger woman.
But if disgust is not dispositive, and we are taught to believe there is no objective basis outside of consent  a very, very thin barrier  for deciding right and wrong, particularly in sexual matters, then the attitude the New York interviewer, and the editor who approved this interview, take towards the horse-screwer is completely understandable.
Linkers second criticism of trads  that we may say, as I did, that our civilization is galloping toward Gomorrah, but in fact we do not know where this is headed  is a truism. Yes, we may turn this around, but on current trends, Im not sure on what basis we do that. As Damon rightly says, we dont have any precedent for running a society in which there is no commonly shared basis for determining right and wrong. Is emotivism and procedural liberalism a solid basis for sustaining a society and a civilization over the long run? I think not. Damon professes not to know, but I read in these lines radical doubt:
Can we do without a publicly affirmed vision of human flourishing? Fulfilling personal preferences (whatever they happen to be), seeking consent in all interactions, and abiding by the imperative of universal niceness  is that sufficient to bring happiness? Or will a world that tells us in a million ways that we are radically undetermined in our ends leave us feeling empty, lost, alone, unmoored, at sea, spiritually adrift?
Read the whole thing. Its worthwhile. Let me say this again: the danger to society is not that a significant number of people are going to start having sex with animals. The danger comes from a society in which a significant number of people see no real justification for condemning those who have sex with animals. It is to concede that we are no different from animals.
Earlier this year, writing in the Jesuit journal America, psychologist Thomas McGovern wrote about the lost generation of young American Catholics. Its a review of Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smiths new book Young Catholic America,which is about how emerging adult Catholics are abandoning the faith in droves.McGovern writes:
Having taught psychology, religion and ethics at three public universities, I can report that a majority of the multigenerational and multiethnic students who took my courses self-identified as former Catholics. Evangelicals brought fervor to discussions and composed essays using biblical quotations and popular pulpit wisdom. With gratitude for an eye-opening semester, the Latter-Day Saints students gave me inscribed copies of theirBook of Mormon. Others spoke of a vague spirituality enabling them to be comfortable in and with their lives. The Catholic students, as this books sub-title about emerging adults (i.e., ages 18 to 23) signals, were mostlyout of faith and gone.
Young Catholic Americadescribes the results of the National Study of Youth and Religion, conducted by telephone surveys and personal interviews for three waves (2002-3, 2005, 2007-8) of a longitudinal study. The respondents were 13 to 17 years old at the beginning and 18 to 23 at the last data collection point. Parents, pastors and ministers of religious education and higher education and secondary school educators will find here thought-provoking sociology-of-religion explanations for how, when and why this sample of young people became who they are and what they dont believe and dont do any more.

Baby boomer readers may gasp at the historical analysis of their parenting summarized in Chapter 1. Centrifugal forces from 1970 to 2000 generated increasing pluralism in American thinking, labeled by these authors as a vulgar version of post-modernism. (One of my true-believer science editors labeled postmodernism the anthrax of the intellect.) With truth and standards fragmented in the larger culturethe center did not holdits effects exacerbated values conflicts within the church in the United States. The authors declare at fault the inability, and sometimes unwillingness of the parents of the Catholic and ex-Catholic emerging adults we studiedand those half a generation earlierto model, teach and pass on the faith to their children. At precisely the same moment, older, more communal, taken-for-granted forms of religious practice and catechesis were eroding and sometimes collapsing in American Catholicism.
McGovern goes on to say this is not just a Catholic thing. He speaks of research showing that undergraduates in the liberal arts are abysmal at articulating anything theyve learned from their college educations  a university communitys core faith. About Catholics, McGovern says Smith et al.s research shows:
According to this study, three factors foster increased religiosity. First, teens must have strong bonds to religiously committed and supportive family and friends. Second, beliefs must be internalized; faith ought to be a persons most useful compass for daily decisions, despite myriad secular guides that saturate their life experiences. Third, as Aristotle noted about civic virtue, faiths principles must be learned first and then behaviorally practiced often.
It makes sense that this must be true for virtue, period, not just religious virtue. This, of course, leads us to philosopher Alasdair MacIntyres After Virtue, which concerns, broadly, the fate of a society and civilization in which the concept of virtue as a binding and authoritative code barely exists.
I will link here to that infamous New York magazine interview with the zoophile, whom Ill call Mr. Ed, but I want to reiterate the strongest warnings. There are no graphic, NSFW images attached to it. But it is incredibly disturbing. I think its important for those with strong stomachs to read, so you will get an idea of a) how utterly vile this mans practices are, and more importantly, b) how he uses the all-too-familiar rhetoric of emotivism, tolerance, and understanding to justify his preferences.
Sooner or later, its going to be the Benedict Option, or chaos. If you will not have God, you had better pay your respects to Mr. Ed.

The American Conservative,C,SWPLs & Eric Garner | The American Conservative,"
A striking comment by reader Bobby, on the Eric Garner death:
I largely move among SWPLs (and probably even qualify as one). I do yoga, eat lots of kale, buy most of my meat and fish from Whole Foods, and get haircuts and massages twice a month at my local Aveda salon. But unlike most SWPLs, I didnt grow up in some upscale manicured suburb. Instead, I grew up in a working-class town in rural northeast Indiana. Some of my closest high school friends have lives that differ markedly from mine.
We ask police officers to make split-second decisions in rapidly evolving situationssituations in which they could easily be injured or lose their lives. We SWPLs wouldnt touch those kinds of jobs for anything. Heck, we last got a callous when we forgot to wear gloves to a spinning class. And, yes, we love the city. Oh, we love the city. That is, as long as those kids from blue-collar suburbs are here to keep it safe for us. I cant count the number of times Ive heard someone say, Bucktown is just as safe as Naperville. And why is that? Its because some guy from Berwyn with a criminal justice degree is making sure that the crime thats occurring 1 mile to your west stays 1 mile to your west. And we SWPLs throw a fit if that guy from Berwyn ever lets that crime seep into our ever-so-safe urban enclave.
But when that 510, 170-pound kid from Berwyn is asked to handcuff a belligerent 63, 300-pound man, we throw a fit because he *gasp* used something that looks like a choke hold. We watch the video of the event over and over again on our iPads from the locally owned coffee shop, where we safely sit and sip on our manual-pourover $6 cup of coffee made from unwashed Ethiopian Yirgacheffe beans grown by a fair-trade cooperative. And, as we analyze it, we pick apart everything that occurred in the 10-second clip. We feel outrage as we take another 40-cent sip, and then dash off to our morning yoga session with Pablo, the former professional soccer player from Costa Rica. Oops, we almost forgot our coconut water.
Strong stuff. What are SWPLs (pron. swipples)? They are the kind of white people satirized by the blog Stuff White People Like.
By the way, Bobby is gay. I suppose this will freak out Mark Joseph Stern, who will like come undone when he discovers that Bobby is empathetic toward the blue collar people with whom he grew up.

The American Conservative,C,Jeb Bushs Victory Plan | The American Conservative,"Jeb Bush outlines a curious political strategy:
Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida was blunt Monday night: If he runs for president in 2016, he will not pander to his partys conservative base in the primaries.
Mr. Bush said at The Wall Street Journals CEO Council in Washington that Republican candidates must be willing to lose the primary to win the general [bold mine-DL], without violating your principles.
This suggests that Bush has forgotten something that his brother learned during his first campaign. When George W. Bush started his campaign, he initially ran against the Congressional GOP and presented himself as a relative moderate, the so-called reformer with results. Many Republicans thought this to be a clever imitation of Clintons New Democrat pitch at the time, but once Bush faced some semi-serious competition from McCain he quickly figured out that he needed to rally conservative voters. So Bush set out to make conservatives believe that he was one of them. Thanks in no small part to McCain and conservative voters dislike for him, Bush was successful in this, and unfortunately for all of us many conservatives identification with Bush persisted for a long time. To some extent, his father had done the same thing in 1988 by presenting himself as Reagans heir. Bushes can certainly win the Republican nomination, but they have to do it by getting primary voters to forget that they are Bushes.
Now Jeb Bush is describing a campaign that would mimic the early part of his brothers first run without any attempt to replicate the later, more successful part. The problem with this isnt that a relative moderate cant win the Republican nomination. In fact, it is rarely the case that the relative moderate hasnt won. Jeb Bushs mistake here is in thinking that a candidate can run what the article calls an unapologetically pragmatic bid and still prevail. Most conservative voters are used to being taken for granted during the general election, and theyre usually willing to play along provided that they think that the nominee shares their priorities. However, the would-be nominee has to convince them first that he is mostly on their side on major issues. If Jeb Bush thinks there are a lot of Republican voters hungering for bland centrism with a dynastic name attached to it, he is in for an unpleasant surprise.

The American Conservative,C,The Uses and Abuses of Historical Analogies | The American Conservative,"Richard Fontaine and Vance Serchuk consider the different historical examples that policymakers and politicians cite in their foreign policy arguments:
In their choice of historical analogy, politicians and policymakers often reveal more about their foreign policy worldview than do conventional partisan or ideological labels.
Thats true as far as it goes. What tells us even more about a persons foreign policy assumptions is how often he falls back on historical analogies and how varied those analogies are. For instance, when a neoconservative or hawk invokes 1938 in response to every single crisis or major event overseas, that mostly tells us that he probably has a very superficial grasp on the particulars of current events. If everything can be reduced to a comparison to the Munich conference and its aftermath, there is no need to make the effort to understand the present-day crisis on its own terms. It also suggests that the person making this comparison is more concerned to score ideological points rather than he is interested in offering relevant analysis. By the same token, citing 1914 as a cautionary tale is potentially just as misleading. While there are tensions between major powers, there is much less danger of a a war between them today than there was a hundred years ago. Invoking the start of WWI can be just as lazy and reflexive as shouting, Munich! We should always want our government to be careful about extending treaty commitments to client states, and we should always want it to exercise caution and not overreact to foreign crises, but most of the lessons they draw from 1914 dont need the example of 1914 to make sense to us.
Historical analogies can sometimes be useful when they are used to inform a debate and give an audience greater perspective on current events, but they are very often used in crude attempts to shoehorn modern events into convenient ideological stories that advocates for a certain set of policies want to tell. Used this way, analogies are necessarily misleading. They are intended to mislead people so that they accept a policy recommendation that may or may not have made sense decades ago in a completely different situation. They are also used to substitute for analysis of the current situation on the remarkably blithe assumption that if it worked there, it will work here. It was this sort of pseudo-historical thinking that informed much of the Bush administrations overconfidence in its ability to turn Iraq into a Western-style democracy: we did it after WWII. When Iraq war supporters werent relying on memories of the post-WWII occupations, they allowed the experience of post-1989 eastern Europe to misinform them about what to expect after regime change in Iraq.
We saw the same sort of shoddy argument during the Libya debate, relying on the Kosovo precedent as proof that a good intervention could work, and the Bosnia example has been endlessly used as a crutch for the extremely bad idea of intervening in Syria. Not coincidentally, this involved exaggerating the success and ease of the earlier Balkan interventions in order to make intervention in Syria seem more appealing. To the extent that opponents of the Libyan war even talked about Iraq, it was to point out the obvious dangers of overthrowing a countrys government with no plan for what followed, but opponents of intervention in Libya didnt need the Iraq example to make the case that destroying the Libyan government would be destabilizing and irresponsible.
The authors continue:
Parallels from the past too often are put forward less to focus debate and discussion than to shut them down.
I agree. Thats why it is instructive to pay attention to which side in these debates most often reaches for historical analogies to use as cudgels in this fashion. It is most often the proponents of action and leadership that are quickest to resort to these analogies, because they tend to be the ones most prone to making dire and alarmist warnings. Describing the present as a replay of the 1930s or 1970s is commonplace among hawks, because they are eager to portray their policy preferences as bold opposition to appeasement and/or decline. In general, supporters of a more restrained foreign policy dont rely on these comparisons as often or as much to argue against specific interventions, since they are only too aware of how often the historical record has been abused in previous debates.

The American Conservative,C,The Dante Club | The American Conservative,"
Eight years ago, San Francisco teacher Callen Taylor saw a need among the students in her school:
Mission High is composed of mostly low-income, minority students, many of them new immigrants learning English. The schools curriculum concentrates largely on modern, multicultural literature as a way to engage students in reading. While Mission students do read a couple of Shakespeares plays and a smattering of other classics before graduation, much of the Western canon never crosses their desks.
Callen Taylor, 30, teaches social studies at Mission and said many of her students lack cultural currency. They have no knowledge of Greek mythology or Renaissance artists or ancient Rome.
She was made especially aware of their gap in knowledge when they returned to Mission last fall after having participated in a variety of summer programs along with wealthier students from other schools. They told her theyd felt intimidated.
They felt like why are all the kids smarter than us? Taylor recalled. Why does everybody seem to know Greek mythology? How do they know Jupiter is the same as Zeus? A lot of people would take that for granted.
Her solution? The Dante Club.
She started a Saturday morning club in which twelve kids would get together and read through the Infernotogether, and talk about the poem. Taylor got the idea after doing Bill Stephanys and Ron Herzmans NEH-sponsored summer program in Siena, in which a select group of high school teachers learn how to make Dante come alive for their students. You can apply for the 2015 program here and as someone who has both been to Siena and benefited massively from Herzmans teaching on Dante via the Great Courses, I cannot encourage you strongly enough to do so. Anyway, this is what happened when Callen Taylor came home from Siena:
She returned to Mission to learn her students had felt ill prepared for their summer programs and believed the Dante Club could give them more confidence. She suggested they all meet the next weekend  Labor Day weekend  to start reading Dante. And they all showed up and havent turned back.
Its a hard poem, and I cant believe they come. Every weekend, Im shocked that they come and want to read it. And they like it! Taylor said. It gives them confidence academically and when they get that, they want more.
She said theyve especially seized on the idea of fate, which plays prominently in Dantes work.
They like that idea  is it fate or do we have control in our life? Taylor said. For kids in poverty, it seems like a lot of their life is up to someone else.
The kids told the San Francisco Chronicle reporter that reading Dante had changed their lives. Readers of the newspaper collected money to send these impoverished kids to Italy, on the Dante trail, and off they went. So now, eight years later, the reporter has done a follow-up piece to see what happened to the club members. It turns out that nearly all of them have done well  and they credit their teacher and Dante for paving the pathway to success.
The highlight of the Dante Club came when the group traveled to Rome, Florence and Siena together on a two-week adventure. Most of the kids had never traveled beyond their initial moves to San Francisco. They marveled at the Sistine Chapel, the statue of David and the rabid Italian fans watching the World Cup.
That was the best experience of, like, my life, Jimenez said. It was crazy. To me, it was amazing.
Lim said she thinks often about the trip to Italy and that the art museums were her favorite part. She said that without Taylors guidance and perseverance, she and the other Dante Club members never would have read the masterpiece or taken the once-in-a-lifetime journey.
This club provided me a different perspective and outlook on life, she said. Who would have thought that a few inner city students would learn so much from the work of Dante Alighieri?
This week and next, I am in a time of extremely intense writing, revising my Dante manuscript. Im writing it in part for readers like these kids, and for teachers like Callen Taylor. If posting is light here in the next few days, know that Im not wasting time.

The American Conservative,C,Federalism Can Still Save Religious Liberty | The American Conservative,"We live in a post-Christian America, broods the insightful natural pessimist on morality and religion, Rod Dreher, writing two long pieces on hisThe American Conservative blog that feature theologian Peter Leithart coming to this dramatic conclusion about government and Christianity in America today:
Weve fooled ourselves for decades into believing that Christian America was derailed recently and by a small elite. Its tough medicine to realize that principles inimical to traditional Christian morals are now deeply embedded in our laws, institutions and culture. The only America that actually exists is one in which marriage includes same-sex couples and women have a Constitutional right to kill their babies. To be faithful, Christian witness must be witness against America.
Specifically, Leithart had predicted beforehand that Tax exemption will be challenged, and so will accreditation for Christian colleges and schools that hold to traditional views of marriage. Once opposition to same-sex marriage is judged discriminatory, no institution that opposes it will be unaffected. He justified his pessimism by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalias dissent in Windsor:
In the majoritys judgment, any resistance to its holding is beyond the pale of reasoned disagreement. To question its high-handed invalidation of a presumptively valid statute is to act (the majority is sure) with the purpose to disparage, injure, degrade, demean, and humiliate our fellow human beings, our fellow citizens, who are homosexual. All that, simply for supporting an Act that did no more than codify an aspect of marriage that had been unquestioned in our society for most of its existenceindeed, had been unquestioned in virtually all societies for virtually all of human history. It is one thing for a society to elect change; it is another for a court of law to impose change by adjudging those who oppose it hostes humani generis, enemies of the human race.
Dreher concluded with an even darker insight, from Catholic Cardinal Francis George:
I am (correctly) quoted as saying that I expected to die in bed, my successor will die in prison and his successor will die a martyr in the public square. What is omitted from the reports is a final phrase I added about the bishop who follows a possibly martyred bishop: His successor will pick up the shards of a ruined society and slowly help rebuild civilization, as the church has done so often in human history.
Dreher bases his grim view from the passion on the matter exercised by the other side of the debate. He recalled that Maggie Gallagher had reported on a 2006 Becket Fund conference about the now EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum who, raised as an Orthodox Jew, was open enough to attend the symposium with the goal of showing gay respect for religion. Yet, it turned out to be a limited type of respect.
To Feldblum the emerging conflicts between free exercise of religion and sexual liberty are real: When we pass a law that says you may not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, we are burdening those who have an alternative moral assessment of gay men and lesbians. Most of the time, the need to protect the dignity of gay people will justify burdening religious belief, she argues. But that does not make it right to pretend these burdens do not exist in the first place, or that the religious people the law is burdening dont matter.
Feldblum believes this sincerely and with passion, and clearly (as she reminds me) against the vast majority of opinion of her own community. And yet when push comes to shove, when religious liberty and sexual liberty conflict, she admits, Im having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.
And it appears that public opinion is now on the side of the gay community. Case closed.
Is America really on the verge of a civil war in which Christians replay the early persecutions? Actually, the most recent Pew survey finds only a plurality of 49 percent in the U.S. support gay marriage but also that 51 percent still think such marriages are sinful. Gays may have won the marriage law but they still lack the legitimacy they demand. The public is split down the middle on whether caterers and florists who have religious objections should be able to refuse services to gays. As far as political elites, region and urbanization play big roles. California has required churches to purchase insurance that includes abortions. Oregon required bakers to supply gay marriage ceremonies. Washington state sued to require a florist to garnish for a gay marriage. Catholic dioceses in Washington D.C. and Boston have left adoption services because forced to refer children to gay couples against church policy. The city of Coeur dAlene, Idaho demanded married, ordained Christian ministers running a wedding chapel, marry gays. The New England Association of Schools and Colleges threatened to revoke their accreditation of Massachusetts evangelical Gordon College if it did not change its policy on homosexuals.
This division reflects that of U.S. politics and culture generally: left and right coasts verses middle America, blue verses red states, sophisticates verses rednecks, religious against secularists, conservatives against liberals. The difference is that power has shifted radically left through the Ivy League elite-dominated Supreme and lower federal courts. But does this mean civil strife? Leithart recommends that discriminated-against Christians witness peacefully even at the cost of reputation, economic opportunity and income or even more serious repression. James Davidson Hunter has long recommended shunning politics and especially national policy and going local to reconnect with Jesus and community. Are the catacombs, then, the only remedy for traditionalists determined to follow their faith as courts take decision-making from local control?
Fortunately, federalism is not that brittle. While granting national appeal courts a strong hand against the states on gay marriage, the most recent Supreme Court decision actually turned the matter back to the states for administrative disposition. National courts have limited ability to write their own marriage laws and even with their oversight there is much room for state action to limit the damage as traditionalists await future changes in the complexion of federal courts and law-making.
Before the Supreme Court ruled, 24 states more-or-less voluntarily adopted or accepted same sex marriage. That means remedies are potentially available in the other 26 states to consider legislative remedies to preserve, in some manner or another, marriage between one man and one woman as a unique relationship. The fact that Republicans now control two-thirds of state legislative bodies makes this possible. At least some gay marriage supportersfor example law professor James G. Dwyerrecognize there is a sufficient state interest to pass federal judicial rational-basis review in treating traditional marriage distinctively based upon the unique biological composition of such unions in producing children and perhaps even because children may benefit more under such relationships.
State regulation of marriage itself could remain minimal as at present, being basically a contract between the couple being married. Only with children and the possibility of their abuse, or in separation or divorce is state regulation of marriage per se common. Marriage could even be a purely private or religious contract without government controls other than offering an alternative state contract for those who might prefer one and for all of them being enforceable in state courts. Divorce and separation options could be specified in the original contract, perhaps with limited additional state oversight. When children are involved, the law could distinguish between different child situations: most sections of traditional state child protection law could be re-organized under the title of biological family law and new titles added for adoption and artificial insemination for other child custody originations, which clearly present different issues. Rational differences could be deduced and the state interest in each identified, including any empirical benefits to children under different relationships.
Significant privatization is essential for marriage and social policy generally if force and severe civil conflict are to be avoided. Justice Anthony Kennedys main concern was to provide equal material benefits to homosexuals as granted to heterosexual couples under Federal laws. That can easily be achieved by granting all welfare benefits to individuals, to children through whoever has legal custody. As far as anti-discrimination laws, these were adopted as an extreme means to combat the extreme evils of slavery and legal segregation. Over time, new aggrieved groups demanded equal remedy for less cause. Applying such laws to sexual preferences and religious disagreements on morality would be momentous. The European religious wars of the past are not appealing futures and make no mistake, a secular demand for moral equality is a religious claim under a different label. One need only look to the Middle East to see what we should want to avoid. Any real reform of marriage must take place freely in what future pope Joseph Ratzinger then called an attitude of non-conformity toward the dictates of current fashion.
Conditions change. Christian marriage did not even require clerical witnesses for its first millennium. The state did not control marriage in Britain until 1754 or in France until the Revolution, before America broke free of both. Catholic marriages were not recognized in the United Kingdom until 1836. Meanwhile, American federalism provided the means for cooling things off. It managed tensions well enough to take extremely diverse colonies, from Puritan New England, to Anglican Virginia, to Quaker Pennsylvania, to Catholic Maryland, to mixes of these and others throughout the colonies and early states finally developing into a nation by allowing each to develop independently and freely. It failed in 1860 with a civil war but slowly a rose again to a reasonably peaceful, just and prosperous America in modern times.
The U.S. is divided once again by strong views on social policy and wisdom suggests the solution once again is regional diversity, federalism, and a live-and-let-live culture. Without them, Dreher, Leithart, and George might just be proven prophetic.

The American Conservative,C,Why the Dishonest Charge of Retreat Endures | The American Conservative,"Michael Cohen reacts with disbelief to Bret Stephens book, America in Retreat:
How can anyone make an argument like that? After all, the evidence that America is not in retreat and has not forsaken a role of global engagement during the Obama presidency is so obvious it is barely worthy of discussion. 
Cohen and I have both made the observation before that there has not been any U.S. retreat from the world. It is worth debating whether there should be significant changes in U.S. foreign policy, including the withdrawal of some U.S. forces deployed in Europe, the Gulf, Asia, but the fact of the matter is that nothing like this has happened or was ever likely to happen under Obama. The charge of retreat (or disengagement in its milder form) is specious and blatantly dishonest, but it continues to be made because it is a useful line of attack for hawks to make against any form of internationalism that isnt as aggressive as theirs. 
Like other bogus claims in foreign policy debate (e.g., isolationism), the charge of retreat is useful precisely because it is misleading and false. First, it puts the target of the accusation on the defensive and distracts attention from the horrible foreign policy views of the person flinging the accusation. Refuting garbage accusations eats up time and energy that might be more productively used in some other way. Casting their opponents as advocates of retreat helps hard-liners to pretend to be the only real internationalists in the debate, and it lets them set the terms of the debate so that anything short of their preferred policies can be equated as retrenchment. That helps hard-liners to drag the debate in their direction by constantly redefining what policies constitute retreat and which are consistent with U.S. leadership. Conveniently, their opponents are always supporters of retreat no matter what the opponents policies happen to be. Obama can conduct a foreign policy that is at least as objectively hawkish and aggressive as any modern president of the last forty years, and he can still be pinned with the retreat and neo-isolationist labels because he hasnt done as much as the hard-liners want him to do. In truth, much of Obamas foreign policy record is appallingly bad, but that is because it has frequently been in line with the kinds of policies that hard-liners support. That is another reason why hard-liners are so eager to portray the Obama record as a retreat: it allows them to disavow the consequences of the administrations failed interventionist policies that they favored.

The American Conservative,C,Against the Mob | The American Conservative,"Let me make my position clear: I dont know whether Jackie was raped at a University of Virginia fraternity house. It might have happened. There is an investigation underway now, as there should be. Ari Schulman points out that there is still reason to believe that Jackie is telling the truth, and that Richard Bradleys celebrated debunking of the Rolling Stone story has problems of its own. This is important to keep in mind. As Ari says, we dont fight confirmation bias from one side with confirmation bias from the other.
What was very wrong, though, was for Rolling Stone magazine to run a blockbuster story that takes the position that the rape actually happened, when these facts have not been established. Hanna Rosin and Alison Benedikt at Slate write:

Erdely is a veryaccomplished magazine writer. She has written about many difficult subjects before, including anOB-GYN who was convicted of fondling his patients. (She didnt talk to him either, but she did include a sentence saying he could not be reached for comment. Plus, he had already been convicted.) She must know the basic rules of reporting a story like this: You try very, very hard to reach anyone youre accusing of something. You use any method you can think of, including the jerk reporter move of making a surprise, in-person confrontation. (Sarah Koenig, the host of theSerialpodcast, provides a good example of reporter due diligence.) You try especially hard if you are writing about something as serious as a gang rape accusation. Sometimes, what results is a more layered version of the truth. Sometimes, the answer you get makes the accused seem even guiltier (e.g., Bill Cosby,asserting through a lawyer, that all the dozens of accusations against him are fabricated).


If you fail to reach the person, you write a sentence explaining that you triedand explaininghowyou triedas a way to assure your readers that you gave the person a chance to defend themselves. Were not sure whyRolling Stonedidnt think that was necessary.

This is Journalism 101. And then, whether they realize it or not, Rosin and Benedikt answer their own question:
We found Jackie and she agreed to talk to us. Then, at the last minute she backed out. She had already been interviewed by theWashington Postfor a story that has not yet run, and she had picked up that the media had some doubtssomething that she is understandably sensitive to. What became clear from talking to Jackies supporters at UVA is that the community of victim advocates operates by a very specific code. The first thing as a friend we must say is, I believe you and I am here to listen,  says Brian Head, president of UVAs all-male sexual assault peer education group One in Four.Head and others believe that questioning a victim is a form of betrayal, because it will make her feel judged and all the more reluctant to ever speak about what happened. None of the people we spoke to had asked Jackie who the men were, and in fact none of them had any idea. They did not press her on any details about the incident.
See how this works? Sensitivity to the alleged victim of a violent crime is commendable. But to take that sensitivity to the point where her viewpoint is exclusively privileged simply because of her claimed status as a crime victim is dangerous, because it sets the stage for potential injustice. If Jackies story was fabricated, then an unspeakable injustice has been done to the Phi Psi fraternity, the Greek system at the University of Virginia, and to the University of Virginia itself. How will they get their reputations back?
Im not letting myself off the hook here. As I said yesterday, I believed the Rolling Stone story when I first read it, and consciously pushed aside doubts I had about the reporting  specifically the obvious fact that Jackie is the only source for what supposedly happened that night, and the fact that the reporter didnt have as much as a No comment from any of the alleged rapists. Why? Partly, I think, because of a lingering bias against fraternities, the legacy of my long-ago college days. Mostly, though, because my years of writing about the Catholic sex abuse scandal has powerfully biased me towards believing victims who accuse powerful institutions of covering up sexual violence to protect the image of the institution.
This is wrong. It is one thing to have observed that institutions tend to behave a certain way. It is another to believe without sufficient evidence that an institution and the people within in behaved that way, because hey, thats what people like that do. If you think you are above doing this, you are lying to yourself. As embarrassed as I am to be confronted with evidence that I chose to ignore red flags in this story because it fit a narrative that made sense to me, I am glad of it, because it reminds me how fallible human judgment is.
The writer Caitlin Flanagan, who wrote a hard-hitting Atlantic story about fraternities and rape, told Slate that if Jackies story turns out to be false,it is going to cause so much trouble in the area of reforming fraternity sexual assault, I cant even tell you. Similarly, the more campaigners hold on to Michael Brown and Ferguson as a symbol of police brutality and racism, the less willing many others are going to be to take a real problem seriously.
It is all too easy to forget that real people stand to be really hurt by false accusations, especially when a system set up to adjudicate them is biased towards one side or the other. As minorities and the poor know all too well, the deck has historically been stacked against them in court. I know of at least two specific cases from where I live, in the Deep South, from back in the 1930s and 1940s, in which black men were killed by powerful white men, who never had to answer for it in court. In one case, a mob called by the sheriff lynched a black man for raping a white woman. It emerged afterward that the two had been lovers, but had been caught, and the woman accused the man of rape to save her own skin. Of course the sheriff believed her. They knew that a white woman would never willingly have sex with a black man. There was no need for a trial (and if there had been a trial, rape was not a capital offense); the sheriff got a mob together and they strung the black man up. Days later, the womans conscience broke, and she confessed that they had been lovers.
Nobody ever answered in court for the extrajudicial murder of that black man. It would have been unthinkable back then. Black lives didnt matter.
Now, think about what the UVA student Brian Head said to Slate:
Head and others believe that questioning a [rape] victim is a form of betrayal, because it will make her feel judged and all the more reluctant to ever speak about what happened.
The sheriff and his mob didnt question the supposed rape victim in that case. She was white, her alleged rapist was black. What more did you need to know? And look what happened.
Is this really the mentality we want to encourage?
It is impossible to guarantee justice in this life. None of us can fully overcome our biases; we are human beings, not machines. But we are required to work hard to do so, and to put in place procedures that keep us from going off the rails because of our own biases. Giving any person the privilege of being believed simply because of their race, gender, sexuality, social status, or any such thing that has nothing to do with their character, is to lay the groundwork for injustice.
One of the reasons I am a conservative is a deep distrust of the mob and its passions. There is something so sweetly intoxicating about losing yourself in the crowd, and being carried along with it, especially if you believe your cause is righteous. The crowd becomes a mob when it loses control of itself, and cannot be stopped until it has its release, sometimes through a scapegoat. Caiaphas helped incite the mob to scapegoat Jesus, saying, You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.
This is what we are up against when the mob decides that the pursuit of truth in a case is secondary to vindicating what we might call the mythological truth. That is, it is better for one fraternity to die than that the cause of stopping sexual violence on campus perish. Or: it is better for one undergraduate woman to be raped than the reputation of the university and its fraternities perish.It is better for one Ferguson cops freedom to be sacrificed than that the cause of fighting police racism and brutality perish. Or: it is better for one black guy to die than public confidence in law enforcement fighting perish.
Civilization is only possible through the submission of the passions to reason. Civilization is not possible when the mob rules. Mobs arent just rioters on the street. They can be crusading journalists in a newsroom, or campus professors and activists. Any time you have a group of people who are willing to sacrifice others, and the truth, for the sake of vindicating a myth or cause dear to them, you have a mob.
Because all of us are capable of that, all of us are potential members of a mob. If you want to stop mob rule, confront it first in your own heart and mind.

The American Conservative,C,Jindals Boilerplate Hawkishness | The American Conservative,"Rosie Gray finds Bobby Jindal trying hard not to annoy too many Republicans on foreign policy:
In a roundtable meeting with reporters before appearing onstage, Jindal came down on basically every side possible in Republican foreign policy.
Gray says that he is trying to to displease as few people as possible, but for the most part the people that he went out of his way to placate are the hard-liners in the party. Thats nothing new for Jindal. When he has previously tried saying something on the subject, he has made all the predictable noises about American exceptionalism and leadership. He even endorsed the silly and dangerous idea of a League of Democracies in his book. His instincts and voting record in Congress have been conventionally hawkish, and his reliance on Jim Talent and John Bolton for advice confirm that he is listening to all the wrong people. Finally, his position on Syria is terrible:
Jindal said he thinks that destroying ISIS shouldnt mean the United States should be deterred from our longer term goal of removing Assad.
So in addition to supporting the current unnecessary war, Jindal is in favor of regime change in Syria that would produce even more instability and violence. He also said that every option needs to be on the table to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power, which lines him up with most other would-be 2016 candidates in their willingness to back an attack on Iran. While he claims to reject the idea that the U.S. should be the worlds policeman, it is difficult to find any crises where he thinks the U.S. shouldnt be actively involved.

The American Conservative,C,Eric Garner & Police Brutality | The American Conservative,"
Yes, the Staten Island grand jury saw and heard a lot more evidence about the police killing of Eric Garner than any of us did. Maybe their decision not to indict was justified. Maybe. But based on the video of the incident, I cant imagine how. It was brutal, their takedown of Garner. That cop killedhelped to kill Eric Garner with that chokehold, which is forbidden by the NYPD. Then his colleagues dogpiled Garner, even after he said he couldnt breathe. How can a grand jury not even see this as worthy of a trial? There is not even a question of the cops lives being in danger from Garner, as there was in the Mike Brown killing.
This is deeply, deeply disturbing. The grand jury proceedings had better be released. Im trying to be fair about this, knowing that the grand jury had access to weeks of testimony that none of us do, but the video is damning. I dont blame people at all for protesting this (though God, please let them be peaceful).
Here is what Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore had to say about it. Excerpt:
Im stunned speechless by this news. We hear a lot about the rule of lawand rightly so. But a government that can choke a man to death on video for selling cigarettes is not a government living up to a biblical definition of justice or any recognizable definition of justice. We may not agree in this country on every particular case and situation, but its high time we start listening to our African American brothers and sisters in this country when they tell us they are experiencing a problem.
For those of us in Christ, we need to recognize that when one part of the Body of Christ hurts, the whole Body of Christ hurts. Its time for us in Christian churches to not just talk about the gospel but live out the gospel by tearing down these dividing walls not only by learning and listening to one another but also by standing up and speaking out for one another.
Maybe, just maybe, a trial would have found these cops not guilty of negligent homicide in Garners death. But based on that video, how can there not even be a trial? This is messed up.
UPDATE: Reader Bobby, who is a lawyer, writes:
I watched the video, and Im not sure what those favoring indictment are seeing. To proceed with an indictment, there has to be some evidence of criminal intent. Thats true even for criminally negligent homicide. I dont see anything in the video to suggest that the officers did what they did with criminal intent.
Like the Darren Wilson case, this is a case for the civil courts, not the criminal courts. And I think thats what these grand juries ultimately decided.
UPDATE.2: More wisdom from Bobby:
We all make mistakes at work. The difference is that most of us arent called upon to carry out our jobs in life-and-death situations. These police officers, all of whom were smaller than the perpetrator, were called upon to arrest a large, belligerent, man who was resisting arrest. Moreover, he had spent the previous 1-2 minutes lying to the police officer, which doesnt give his much credibility when he later protests about his alleged breathing problems.
Moreover, I think we have to take into account the expectations we place on police. As white-collar professionals take up residence in the city, we expect police to create an environment that makes us feel as safe as wed feel on the streets of Rye or Harrison. We expect police to make sure that we dont have to encounter annoying nuisances like Garner during our walks to work. But we want them to do it in a way thats neat and clean, and that doesnt expose the messiness of the racism thats implicit in what were asking them to do.
I was recently riding the train in Chicago. After an annoying black man was escorted off the train by police, I overheard a young woman say the following.
I dont understand why theyre still here. We dont have low-skill manufacturing jobs for them anymore. If theyre not going to conform to societal expectations, its simply time for them to go back home to Mississippi. Its much easier to be poor and have no skills in the country and in a warmer climate.
Weve long since stopped trying to address the problems of urban poverty. The goal now is to contain it and to isolate it to a few neighborhoods that lie far from places where respectable people go. And whether we admit it or not, were not simply asking police to keep us safe; were also asking them to make sure that the refugees remain invisible when they step outside of their refugee camps.
UPDATE.3: Reader Polichinello, quoting from Bobbys post, then chiming in with a remark of his own:
I dont understand why theyre still here. We dont have low-skill manufacturing jobs for them anymore. If theyre not going to conform to societal expectations, its simply time for them to go back home to Mississippi.
LOL.
Thus we have the SWPL master plan for their hipsterburgs. Cleanse their metropolises of blacks, and if the rubes in places like Ferguson protest all the new Section 8 neighbors showing up with their social pathologies, call them racist.

The American Conservative,C,Ferguson Is Not Palestine | The American Conservative,"In the morning e-mail came something from the activist group CODEPINK, headlined From Ferguson to Palestine, Come Out to Join Us. Listed were various events: a vigil for Michael Brown at the Justice Department, a meeting of fighters for social justice at a popular Washington cafe the following evening, similar events in that vein. Also on the list was a talk by professor Richard Falk, formerly UN special rapporteur on Palestine, to discuss Israels latest land grab around Jerusalem.
CODEPINK is not alone in seeking to connect Ferguson to Palestine: pro-footballer Reggie Bush tweeted something about it over the weekend, andAnnie Robbinsof the important Mondoweiss website publicized the Bush tweet. Then theresthis: a post by a board member of the right-wing Zionist group StandWithUs, connecting anti-Palestinian Israelis with the Ferguson police, both holding the line of civilization against peoples full of rage and an unjustified sense of their own victimhood. There was some Twitter pushback against the StandWithUs post, and theTimes of Israeleventually removed it. The pro-Palestinian website Electronic Intifada portrayed this as some sort a victory, rather as if the Palestinians had won the right to possess Ferguson as their symbol. Rania Khalekwrites that Zionist organizations are rattled by the growing displays of solidarity between people in Ferguson, Missouri, and Palestine. While its true that suchsuch displays are growing, I doubt seriously that any Zionist organizations are rattled by them. If they have any political savvy, and they surely do, they would instead welcome itas did the StandWithUs board member.
Why? Well, for starters, Palestine really is occupied, and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have no political and civil rights, and those who reside in Israel proper are now being told that Israel can take away their citizenship at any time.
Ferguson, by contrast, is a complicated situation. The one simple thing about it is the fact that if Michael Brown hadnt leaned into a police cruiser in order to assault a police officer and to try to seize his gun, he would be alive today. As always there is a broader social and historical context: a considerable amount of police brutality directed at blacks, exemplified by episodes likethis,on top of many layers of American history in which blacks were enslaved, and after emancipation, subject to fierce legal and customary discrimination. I largely agree withJohn McWhorter, who asserts that throughout America there are large segments of the black community who consider the police morally bankrupt, and that this is a huge national problem. It is certainly a problem with no easy answer. There wasnt one in the 1960s when finding a decent, family-sustaining job was achievable for most people willing to work regular hours, and it is no easier now in an economy far far more geared to rewarding the very rich, highly skilled, or very talented, while the working class has lost ground steadily for 40 years.
The thing about Palestine, however, is that it is actually not that complicated. Resolving the issue in a fair and practical way is of course difficult. But it has long been an article of faith among pro-Palestinian activists that if Americans could see the land-grabbing, see the checkpoints Palestinians are subjected to, see the difficulty of trying as a student to commute through roadblocks and checkpoints to Bethlehem University from Ramallah, they would understand that Palestinians are subject to a blatantly unjust and racist regime, facing conditions no American would put up with for a moment without resisting. And they would see that this Israeli regimeheavily subsidized by American tax dollarsis animated by ideologies sharply at odds with American values, at least with how those values have evolved over the past 50 to 100 years. Perhaps Israels treatment of the Palestinians resembles South Africa under apartheid, perhaps it resembles the American South of the pre-civil rights era; perhaps it is worse than both. It does not, in any way, shape, or form, resemble Ferguson, Missouri, where all American-born blacks possess the same constitutional and civil rights as white Americans.
To the extent that the American left succeeds in creating an impression of some sort of rhetorical and moral equivalence between Ferguson and Palestine, describing both venues as places where a virtuous, oppressed people confronts brutal and murderous white racism, they will harm the prospects of Palestinian struggles ever being considered sympathetically by a critical majority of Americans. For the fact is, the more Americans learn about Ferguson, the less sympathy Michael Brown and his cause receives. The young man surely should not have been shot to deathOfficer Darren Wilson probably blundered in a dangerous and chaotic situation. But to hold Brown blameless is something that most Americans wont do.
Before the grand jury decision was announced, aHuffington Post YouGov pollindicated that only 22 percent of whites thought that Officer Wilson was culpable, versus 64 percent of blacks. After the release of the the grand jury report, after Ferguson residents showed their displeasure by widespread looting and burning, after mainstream news shows showed the Brown family lawyer getting decimated in on-air debates about the facts in the case, after Michael Browns stepfather mounted a podium to tell Ferguson residents to burn the bitch down, the poll numbers are not going to shift more in favor of the racist whites versus innocent blacks narrative. That the United States is so divided racially, on this issue and others, is, of course a national problem. But it is surely not one which Palestinian activists should seek to exploit by linking their cause to the losing side.
In all of this, of course, are echoes of the American 1960s. The activism of that decade began with a movement of civil rights activists, white and black, risking their lives to secure for blacks in the South their fundamental constitutional rights. It expanded with opposition to the Vietnam war. It reached a crisis point when liberalism, the dominant ideology of the age, had to confront the reality of black rioting in northern cities, demonstrating how complex the racial issue was, how difficult it would be resolve it. Part of the Left soon embraced the idea that any black demand, any black behavior, was justified. Some New Left theorists advanced the notion that ghetto blacks were a revolutionary vanguard in the mother country. Off the Pigs, Power to the People did, really, become a New Left slogan. (Pigs was the common epithet for police officers. Off meant kill.)Black Panther chicadvanced to the salons of the Upper East Side. It wasnt especially obvious to everyone at the time, but these were sign posts that the movement had imploded, had driven itself mad, and was so committed to hating whitey that it was on the road to becoming essentially irrelevant to any serious politics in America.
There are more than a few whiffs of that era in the current Michael Brown madness. Most Palestinian activists realize that if they could win for their people in historic Palestine the rights possessed by each and every black citizen of Ferguson they would have gained a victory of world-historic proportions. Nevertheless one can understand the temptation of connecting to a movement in America that does at this moment seem energetic and hip, which seems to be treated with enormous deference and respect in the dominant media, and which must seem for all the world like an unstoppable emergent groundswell. Added to this is the important if seldom-noted fact that black members of Congress have, on average, been far more ready than their white colleagues to see the need for justice in Palestine, and have been more willing to question and challenge the self-righteousness behind Americas blind and often murderous policies in the Mideast. The connections emerging from those sentiments should, of course, be welcomed and nurtured.
Ferguson however is a bridge too far. Nothing could please the Likud coalition more than to see the Palestinian cause linked, in the minds of the average, mainstream American, to that of the Ferguson rioters. For the pro-Palestinian left to work to reinforce exactly that linkage will be seen as dreadful mistake, for which Palestinians will surely pay a higher price than American leftists will.

The American Conservative,C,"Chris Rocks, Chris Rolls | The American Conservative","There will be something to irritate almost everyone in this Frank Rich interview with Chris Rock, but you know what? There are some real gems here too. I love that Chris Rock. Excerpts:
What do you make of the attempt to barBill Maher from speaking at Berkeley forhis riff on Muslims?
Well, I love Bill, but I stopped playing colleges, and the reason is because theyre way too conservative.
In their political views?
Not in their political views  not like theyre voting Republican  but in their social views and their willingness not to offend anybody. Kids raised on a culture of Were not going to keep score in the game because we dont want anybody to lose. Or just ignoring race to a fault. You cant say the black kid over there. No, its the guy with the red shoes. You cant even be offensive on your way to being inoffensive.
When did you start to notice this?
About eight years ago. Probably a couple of tours ago. It was just like,This is not as much fun as it used to be.I remember talking to George Carlin before he died and him saying the exact same thing.
More:
Before Obama arrived, you were saying that thered been Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, and then black leaders in America became like substitute teachers.
I mean, you got to realize, theres not a need for it the way there was. Back then, we needed that guy for our day-to-day existence. Now you only feel the need in special cases. So, okay, Ferguson goes down. Youre like,Oh, itd be great if we had a guy.
When Al Sharpton goes down to Ferguson, it feels like a media ritual rather than an actual civil-rights action.
Its a revival, where King was doing an original play. Its a good part. The lead is open.
One more:
Where else besides Ferguson would you hypothetically want to interview white people?
Id love to do some liberal places, because you can be in the most liberal places and theres no black people.
I assume one such place is Hollywood.
I dont think Ive had any meetings with black film execs. Maybe one. It is what it is. As I told Bill Murray,Lost in Translationis a black movie: Thats what it feels like to be black and rich. Not in the sense that people are being mean to you. Bill Murrays in Tokyo, and its just weird. He seems kind of isolated. Hes always around Japanese people. Look at me right now.
Were sitting on the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking Central Park.
And theres only really one black person here whos not working. Bill Murray inLost in Translationis what Bryant Gumbel experiences every day. Or Al Roker. Rich black guys. Its a little off.
Whole thing here.

The American Conservative,C,The Greatly Overrated Rubio | The American Conservative,"Josh Kraushaar touts Rubio as the Republican front-runner:
The leading contender for the GOPs presidential nomination is polling at a measly 3 percent in two new national surveys testing Republican primary candidates. He wasnt even included in Bloombergs November poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters. Hes been overshadowed by the medias obsession with brand-name candidates, like Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, even though his profile is more compelling than either.
Kraushaar can claim that Rubio is the leading contender for the nomination if he wants, but there doesnt seem to be much to support that. As Scott Conroy points out this week, it isnt at all certain that Rubio will even seek the nomination. For my part, I have guessed that Rubio wont run at all and will focus on his re-election bid. Conroy also notes that the buzz that Rubio has generated the last few years has not resonated much outside of his home state. Rubio already lost some of the early support that he had enjoyed when he was being prematurely built up as the answer to the GOPs woes. Many politicians temporarily benefit from speculation about their aspirations for higher office, and Rubio was no different. Rubios problem is that his boomlet happened two years ago, and political journalists and pundits have mostly moved on to look at other potential candidates.
The case for Rubio may seem strong at first glance, but makes no sense under closer scrutiny. For instance, take Kraushaars first claim that Rubio can win support from both the establishment wing of the party and tea-party activists. That may have seemed true when he was first elected, and it might have been true two years ago, but I dont think it holds up today. Now many of the activists that originally supported him feel that he betrayed them on immigration, and many establishment Republicans dont need Rubio when they have other candidates that will give them what they want. Rubios anemic polling in early states cant really be explained by lack of name recognition. It is more likely that his old supporters lost interest in him as they learned what he did in office.
So it is a remarkable stretch to say that he is the most electable Republican in the 2016 field when he is in single digits nationally and in early primary states. Even in Florida, he averages 13% support. Rubio has won exactly one statewide race in his career, and that was an odd three-way contest in an exceptionally Republican years. Assuming that Rubio is most electable because of his biography makes even less sense. Most Hispanics arent going to be interested in voting for a conservative Cuban-American, and young voters arent likely to be impressed by a foreign policy hard-liner in his forties. A child of the 1970s whose thinking and arguments are still mostly stuck in the 1980s will have little or nothing of interest to say to the generations that came of age since then.
Kraushaar places a lot of emphasis on Rubios background in foreign policy, but for all practical purposes his background is not noticeably more extensive than that of other first-term senators that have also shown an interest in the subject. Its true that Rubio has spent a lot of time talking about foreign policy issues, and he clearly wants to be known for his hawkish views (while disavowing the label and baggage associated with it), but that doesnt make him that much more qualified than most of the other possible 2016 candidates. While Rubio may be comfortable talking about foreign policy, he isnt likely to appeal to anyone except other hard-liners. His record as a vocal advocate for new military interventions is more likely to be off-putting to many of the somewhat conservative voters that often decide primary winners. Hawkishness by itself wont be a liability for him among Republican voters, but he has pigeonholed himself as one of the most consistently aggressive hawks in the Senate. Despite support specifically for the war against ISIS, the public still doesnt have any desire for a foreign policy as aggressive as Rubio prefers.

The American Conservative,C,Ukraine and NATO | The American Conservative,"Christoph Schult criticizes NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg for commenting on possible Ukrainian membership in NATO:
And herein lies the problem: Only a small minority  comprised primarily of the Baltic states and Poland  currently support Ukrainian accession to the alliance. All others adhere to the principle that each accession should not only be beneficial to the new member, but also to the community as a whole. Its difficult to see at the moment how Ukraine might benefit NATO.
In that sense, there is only one right answer in response to Poroshenkos musings. Its the one formulated by German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. I see a partner relationship between Ukraine and NATO, but not membership, the foreign minister told SPIEGEL ONLINE last week.
Or, to put it more simply, the question of Ukrainian membership isnt even on the agenda.
Indeed, NATO would be better off if it explicitly ruled out the possibility of future Ukrainian membership and laid this issue to rest once and for all. The optimal time to have done that was several years ago when Ukraine affirmed that it would not join any military alliance, but instead the alliance insisted on keeping the door open to Ukraine. Since the new government has changed Ukraines position on alliance membership once again, it is up to the alliance to dispel any illusions about the countrys prospects of joining. Merely stating the obviousthat most NATO members dont want Ukraine in the alliance and Ukraine wont be permitted to joincould help reduce tensions with Russia and could possibly make a political settlement between Ukraine and Russia easier to reach. Ukraine isnt ever going to be part of NATO because it would be a huge liability for the alliance, and it is long past time for U.S. and alliance officials to make that clear.

The American Conservative,C,A Chuck Hagel Postmortem | The American Conservative,"As a follow-up to my discussion with Stephen Walt, I wanted to say a few more words about Chuck Hagels tenure as Secretary of Defense.
When Hagel was originally hired, I questioned the consensus that his nomination signaled a shift to a more restrained foreign policy:
Its pleasant to think that the President actually wants Hagels advice, but that strikes me as somewhat unlikely. First of all, the President, by all reports, takes most of his advice from a very close circle. Though Obama got a favorable impression of him in his brief time in the Senate, Hagel isnt in that circle. Second, whats Hagel going to offer advice about? Handling the DoD? Hagel has expressed an interest in trimming the fat at Defense  but thats very different from seeming like the sort of person who would be effective at out-maneuvering vested interests who will oppose that trimming. Handling Iran? Hagels shown a real interest in an approach that emphasizes the desire for normal relations over one that assumes a confrontational posture is the only realistic option, but thats not the same thing as saying that he has any particular regional expertise. Handling Congress? Was Hagel a notably effective Senator?
Another possibility is, as noted, that the President wanted to make a point  to signal that he was interested in a less-confrontational foreign policy, and in modestly reducing military spending. But if he wanted to send a signal, why send it tentatively?
Meanwhile, the opposite interpretation is also possible: that the President wanted someone like Hagel to endorse whatever his policies already are. . . . And a third possibility is that President Obama didnt think that carefully about the symbolism of the choice, but thought of Hagel simply as a Republican I can work with that would earn bi-partisan points for bringing him in. That would have been foolish of him, but you know, discounting the possibility of incompetence is rarely wise in evaluating what goes on in Washington.
I concluded as follows:
[T]he real question is whether Hagel would be effective at managing the Pentagon. I dont have any particular insight on that question, but its not obvious to me that Hagel fits that particular bill. The last Secretary of Defense I can recall who muscled material reductions in military spending was a fellow named Dick Cheney. And look what he turned into after 9-11. So you really never can tell.
Now, in the wake of Hagels departure, were getting news stories like this one, claiming that Hagel was largely kept out of the loop of decision making (which we already knew), but also that Hagel was hardly the advocate of foreign policy restraint that his boosters might have assumed, specifically advocating a firmer line on Russia than the Administration was willing to take. That doesnt surprise me too much, as Hagel was also responsible for over-hyping the threat posed by the Islamic State before the White House had settled on a response.
To be fair, the heart of Hagels criticism, as articulating in that WSJ story, is that the U.S. has not been sufficiently clear in its policies, that weve lurched from strong statements to weak actions  which is, I would agree, a very fair criticism  and that we dont have an overall strategy. Hagel correctly understood that the Administration approach of asserting American centrality in every conflict while being very cautious about actually committing resources was causing foreign observers to question Americas true level of commitment. But he wasnt willing to advocate either a more outright hawkish approach to these conflicts, or an outright more restrained policy that took American intervention off the table.He didnt want to oust Assad but he wanted to be clearer about our goals in Syria. He wanted to de-escalate tensions with Russia but he wanted to do more to rein in Putin and reassure our European allies. He thought we needed to consider creative options but he didnt advocate a position different than the ones Mr. Obama was pursuing.
Hagel was frustrated by the indecision and lack of strategic thinking at the highest level. But he was similarly indecisive and had no particularly noteworthy strategic insights to add. He became a vehicle for expressing the dissatisfactions of the Pentagon with the President rather than someone who could successfully bridge the growing gap between the President and the Pentagon.None of which surprises me at all  its entirely in keeping with the impression I formed of Hagel when he was a Senator.
The challenge for advocates of a more restrained foreign policy remains the same as it has been for a generation now since the end of the Cold War. We either have to accommodate the rise of other powers by bringing our own policies more into line with their interests, which might facilitate working in concert to maintain order internationally  or we have to accommodate the rise of other powers by actively withdrawing from areas in which they have greater interests than we do, effectively giving up on the idea of concerted maintenance of international order in favor of something more closely resembling a spheres-of-influence approach.
But neither alternative is particularly popular. We  both the foreign policy establishment and, if we are honest, the American people  seem prefer lurching between trying to maintain hegemony on the cheap, and trying to maintain it more expensively. Both Hagel and Obama have done their share of lurching. We should assume that the next two years will feature more of the same, regardless of who Hagels successor is.

The American Conservative,C,Iran: We Need to Talk | The American Conservative,"Nuclear negotiations with Iran have been extended, but the incoming Republican Senate majority isnt enthusiastic about them.
Were definitely getting played by the Iranians, says Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, a leading proponent of sanctions.
Extending talks with Iran wont achieve the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free Iran, concurs Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
The negotiations have been much waste of time, according to another conservative observer, since the chief negotiator was not to be trusted.
Actually, this last quote comes from a hard-line Iranian newspaper. Despite the well-worn talking point that diplomacy plays into the hands of the ayatollahs and the mullahs, Iranian hard-liners are as skeptical of talking as John McCain.
You cannot trust the Great Satan, the Iranian army deputy chief of staff has been quoted as saying. The Great Satan promises but does not deliver.
Diplomacy will be deeply unsatisfying for American policymakers expecting zero uranium enrichment or Iranians who want zero Western sanctions. But support for this course doesnt require any undue faith in either Tehrans intentions or the Obama administrations competence.
After the Iraq War, invading and occupying Iran to shut down any nuclear program is out. Our viable options beyond blithely accepting Iranian assurances it is not building a bomb are limited.
The West can work to prevent an Iranian bomb through aggressive and intrusive international inspections. Or we can hope some combination of bombing and sanctions will either persuade Tehran to abandon any nuclear ambitions or cause the Iranian people to overthrow their government.
Senate hawks argue that bombing Iranian nuclear sites could set the nuclear program back further than the interim deal. But few argue U.S. or Israeli strikes could end it permanently.
Bombing would not only delay Iranian nukes at a greater human cost, it would risk rallying young, reformist segments of the population behind the ayatollahs. It would harden Iranian support for the nuclear program not just as a matter of national pride but as a guarantee of the governments survival.
Over time, our intelligence about where the nuclear sites are would deteriorate relative to what we would learn through inspections. And the idea that sanctions and bombings will produce a pro-American response from the Iranian populace simply flies in the face of human nature.
A sanctions regime without strong international support may make Senate cosponsors feel good about themselves, but it wont do much to influence Iranian behavior. Just ask the Cubans, whose communist tyranny has outlived the Soviet Union by a quarter-century, about the embargo.
Is an Iranian nuclear deal guaranteed to work? No. Senate Republicans point to the failure of the 1994 pact with North Korea, negotiated by the Clinton administration with the help of Jimmy Carter (making it a perfect symbol of disaster for conservatives) as an example of what could go wrong.
But this example also illustrates the limits of the more hawkish alternatives. Absent some unacceptable level of aggression by North Korea, who really counsels war as the solution?
The Republican congressional majorities of the 1990s didnt like the North Korean framework either. But the actual policies they were free to contemplate fell short of their rhetoric about overthrowing a rogue regime.
Many Republicans sense that their options arent much better with Iran today. Thats why a joint letter from the incoming Republican senators, whose foreign-policy views are on average more Tom Cotton than Rand Paul, asks for comprehensive inspections of suspected nuclear development sites and is silent on military force.
Inspections are not perfect, but their track record is preferable to other options.
After more than a decade of U.S. war in the region, is Iran weaker or stronger? How about militants like the Islamic State or jihadists in post-regime-change Libya? Does international law prevail, or the law of unintended consequences?
To ask these questions is to answer them. Perhaps this time it is better to jaw-jaw than to war-war.
It may be possible to avoid both an Iranian bomb and war with Iran. Its certainly possible to end up with both a war and a bomb.

The American Conservative,C,Galloping Toward Gomorrah | The American Conservative,"A couple of nights ago, I ran across a lengthy interview in New York magazine, titled, What Its Like to Date a Horse. I thought it was a satire of some sort. Its not. Im not linking to it, because it is sick, sick stuff. Its incredibly graphic, and I had decided not to write about it. But the more I thought about the thing, the more disturbed it made me. Heres why: Whats significant is not that this deranged behavior happens. It has no doubt always been with us. Whats significant is that this interview appears in a mainstream magazine.
Says the zoophile in the interview: I love me. I love who I am. I love my sexuality.  I wish we could talk more openly about sex and alternative sexual interests, or just sex in general. He says that if we could do that, maybe so many zoophiles wouldnt kill themselves. More:
Since theres so much stigma attached to being a zoophile I imagine that means you dont tell many people. Does it cause a split personality? What is it like for you to have a sexuality thats not really accepted or understood?

Im really lucky to have my wife, because nobody would ever guess.  Having said that, though, you are quite correct that its something that makes people feel confused and alone, and they have no idea what to think about what they are, and they cant talk to anybody. Ive heard stories of people getting shock or aversion therapy. I really dont understand the hatred.
Do you wish you could be out and proud?

Absolutely. Ive always been a very political person, and one of the reasons I started seeing a therapist is because I found that lately Im having trouble with what people say about zoophiles. The same arguments over and over again, and nobody can support me because they get labeled. Its been very hard dealing with those emotions and the heaviness of what it would be like to get caught and whats being said and done to zoophiles, and the fact is, rather than actually engage with us, people would prefer to ignore us.
What have I done? I am a normal, average, hardworking guy. I pay my taxes, I make fairly good money, I have a nice house. I have dogs, I have ferrets, I have cats, a couple of rats, chickens in my backyard Ive saved from places where they were just going to get killed. What have I done thats so wrong? What is so wrong about physical contact between [myself and an animal]? And it does bring a weight. The experience of being a zoo adolescent was extremely lonely. I had no one to turn to, nobody to ask questions, and even if I had trusted someone I feel now like I would have gotten bad, heteronormative advice. It was a silent day-to-day struggle.
Yes, well, heaven forbid that somebody would give a freak who wants to poke a horse bad, heteronormative advice.
Princetons Robert George writes on his Facebook page:
First, please, somebody tell me that the interview in New York Magazine entitled What Its Like to Date a Horse is a fake or some sort of spoof. Second, I will not post it here, because it is too disturbing. I urge friends not to read it unless you have a very, very, very strong stomach. I mention it, reluctantly, only to show that anyone who thought we had already reached the bottom of the slippery slope is mistaken. The descent into Gomorrah continues. I believe it can be reversed, but not simply stopped. This far and no farther, is not an option. He who says A, says B. Once a set of premises is adopted or endorsed, logic carries one to certain conclusions. One may have a subjective wish (rooted in an aversion, or preference, or lack of interest, or whatever) to where the logic of a position takes one, but a wish (or an aversion, or a preference) is not a principle.
Hes right. Again, I stress that the most disturbing thing about this is not that people who do this exist. Its that a mainstream American magazine has published something this unspeakably perverse. And not just any mainstream magazine: New York has been a trendsetter since the 1960s. Under its current editor, former New York Times-man Adam Moss, New York has won a slew of National Magazine Awards, including being named 2013s Magazine of the Year. This isnt an Al Goldstein rag. This isnt even the Village Voice.
Theres no way around it: New York magazine is mainstreaming bestiality as an alternative sexuality. Its just different. Who are you to judge, you bad heteronormative person? How does his relationship with the mare affect you, huh?
One extremely tasteless and morally revolting interview in a leading magazine is not the end of the world. But it is a signpost. Its not going to make everyone run out and get an animal boyfriend or girlfriend. But it does attempt to weaken an important taboo by giving a sympathetic forum to a deranged man whose behavior deserves the strongest condemnation, and who personally needs help.Its important to pay attention to this for exactly the reason Robby George says. Ideas have consequences. If your idea is that all consensual sex is good, or at least beyond judgment, and that sexual desire is its own justification, then you have met your consequence in New Yorks anonymous zoophile. If you can stomach reading the thing, its rather remarkable how the perv defends himself and his desire using the language and reasoning we have all become familiar with in other contexts.
(And by the way, if the only thing you have to stand on to condemn Captain Equus here is that his girlfriend cant meaningfully consent, then, well, you are ridiculous.)

The American Conservative,C,COIN Is a Proven Failure | The American Conservative,"In late October MSNBCs Ronan Farrow asked retired Army Lt. Col. John Nagl to give viewers a deeper understanding of the fight between the Islamic State (ISIS) and Kurdish fighters around Kobane. Widely credited with writing the book on successful counterinsurgency (COIN) operations, Mr. Nagl said, weve got 1,500 guys on the ground, but theyre not as far forward as they need to be to make a real, immediate impact on the battlefield. He and a number of COIN experts argue that along with 15,000 U.S. ground troops, Iraqi, Kurdish, and Syrian rebel soldiers can defeat ISIS. Before making any decisions, American leaders should first consider this: despite what is often claimed by a host of advocates, the COIN theories upon which these recommendations are based were in fact demonstrable failures in both Afghanistan and Iraq. We must not sacrifice any more American lives and harm American interests any further by acting on theories that are likely to fail again.
It has been taken as an obvious truth by many Americans and major media outlets that the counterinsurgency strategy brought to Iraq by former general David Petraeus in 2007 turned a near-certain defeat into an historic victory. There were two key fundamentals from which many believe victory sprang. The first was that American troops needed to leave U.S. bases and live in the neighborhoods with Iraqi citizens, the second that a surge of troops would give Baghdad breathing space to form an inclusive government. Instead of leading to success, however, these twin pillars may have contributed to the failure.
In a study published earlier this year by the National Defense University, authors Sterling Jensen and former Iraqi general Najim al-Jabouri wrote this of the Americans effectiveness in Anbar province cities: [t]he surge did not have a role in the Anbar Awakening. Surge troops that came to Anbar in 2007 were not seen as useful In fact, U.S. troops in general were not seen as useful even before the surge
But the authors possibly most pointed finding was that the causal factor behind the eventual drop in violence had little to do with either the increase in U.S. troops or the new strategy: If not for al Qaedas murder and intimidation campaign on Sunnis, and its tactic of creating a sectarian war, the Anbar Awakeninga fundamental factor in the success of the 2007 surgemost probably would not have occurred, and it would have been difficult for the United States in 2006 to convince Sunnis to partner with them in a fight against al Qaeda
The Sunni-initiated Anbar Awakening, followed by the Petraeus-led Sons of Iraq program, resulted in a dramatic drop in violence. The breathing space purchased with considerable American blood was intended to facilitate the development of Iraqi democracy. Kelley Vlahos, contributing editor for The American Conservative, recently wrote, in hindsight, the only meaningful space created was for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to use America to rid him of political enemies, not the least of which were many Iraqi Sunni leaders and groups.
Malikis oppressive rule, which alienated much of the Sunni population in the Western part of the country, was a key factor in the rise of ISIS; his penchant to dismiss Sunni officers and pack the senior ranks of the Iraqi Security Force (ISF) with inexperienced political patrons played a major role in the disintegration of the ISF when the Islamic State began its offensive.
I served in Iraq as a military trainer in 2009, and have twice deployed to Afghanistan (2005, 2010-11). Between my 2009 Iraq deployment and the last Afghanistan deploymentat the height of that surgeI traveled over 14,000 miles throughout both countries, going on mounted and dismounted patrols, with U.S., allied, Iraqi, and Afghan troops, and led a team to train an Iraqi border battalion. I can conclusively state that outside the wire, the counterinsurgency theories were an unqualified failure at the strategic level. The populations were never protected in either country. The insurgent forces were never fully defeated in either countryand are stronger now than they have been at any time since 9/11. The Afghan and Iraqi governments remain the third and seventh most corrupt governments in the world, and do not have the support of their people. The armed forces for both countries, despite the decade-long effort and tens of billions of dollars that the U.S. spent training them, are virtually incapable of conducting even basic security.
It is incomprehensible that with such an extensive, publicly available record of failurewhich cost the United States $2 trillion in direct outlays, 6,842 U.S. troops killed and 52,281 wounded in actionthat the designers of this failed concept are given any credibility. The conclusive evidence of the failure is on graphic display right now, in both countries: after six full years and tens of billions spent, the U.S.-trained Iraqi army melted away before a few thousand irregular fighters; after the U.S. pulled out of Helmand province in Afghanistan, the Afghan National Security Forces were incapable of preventing an immediate return of the Taliban.
As the presidents national security team continues to develop a new strategy to deal with ISISand now also searches for a new secretary of defenseit is more important than ever to make a no-holds-barred analysis of the past decade of combat experience before settling on a new strategy. No matter how many U.S. boots might be placed on the ground in Iraq or Syria in this current environment, they would not be able to accomplish the presidents previously stated objectives. All the additional causalities we would suffer would be in vain.
We must not send any more Americans into the morass of Iraq and Syria with as little concern as one might show shoveling coal into a furnace. They deserve better than to be asked to risk their lives to conduct a no-win tactical mission.

The American Conservative,C,Considering Thankfulness | The American Conservative,"I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought; and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.
 G.K. Chesterton
Thanksgiving: its an idea given concrete embodiment, a virtue thats taken the form of turkey and gravy, football and 5Ks. Its easy to get distracted from the actual thanksgiving in our Thanksgivings, by bloated stomachs and Black Friday shopping, touchdown passes and pumpkin pie.
But this national celebration of thanks is perhaps one of the most vital opportunities we possess to ponder the meaning of thankfulness: why it matters, and what it ought to look like in our everyday lives. Its an opportunity for all of usregardless of whether we go around the table sharing trite what Im thankful for speechesto consider what thanksgiving reallyis, and what we are really thankful for.
Many, when pondering things theyre thankful for, will consider circumstantial comforts: food on their tables, a roof over their heads, the comfort of friends and spouses. All of these things are good, and worth being thankful for.
But as our world aches with protests and wars, death and povertywith decay and grief of a million sortsit is important for us to express a different, a deeper sort of thankfulness. Because if all we have to be thankful for is our circumstances, then next Thanksgiving may not be so bright and cheery. If all we have to be thankful for are our circumstances, then Thanksgiving becomes a feast of forgetfulness, a blas masquerade. Because sometimesour circumstances are terrible. There are riots in Ferguson, violent protests over injustices and death. There are Christians fleeing for their lives in the Middle East, looking for shelter, desperate for protection. There are people in slavery, forced to work in brick kilns or brothels, desperate for freedom. There are countless families experiencing divorce, estrangement, separation, or alienating bitterness.Many of us feel the aching pain of death and loss this holiday seasonthere is an empty seat at our Thanksgiving table.
The original Thanksgiving wasnt all rainbows and butterflies, either. There were 50 Plimouth Plantation settlers at the first Thanksgivingthey were all who remained of the original 100 settlers. Their travels to the U.S. had resulted in death and hardship.
It is difficulteven painfulto be thankful, at times. Andyet we still celebrate Thanksgiving. Why?
We must not come to the Thanksgiving table lightly, being foolishly indifferent or Pollyanna-ish about what were thankful for, leaving all our annoyances and griefs and pains outside in the cold. We must acknowledge their presence, the ache they represent in our lives.But we must also look past the decay and death, to the grace and mystery beneath. We must remember the gifts that thread through our existence, tinging everything with joy.
We must see life as a gift: as something precious, something we could never have earned or deserved. Each moment we spend in community is a tremendous grace.
We must see this world as a gift, in all its beauty and goodness, in all its tragedies. It is breathtaking, mysterious, beautiful.
We must see love as a giftevery warm heart, every loving marriage and caring friendship, every beloved family member or moment of camaraderie. We must not take kith and kin for granted.
Thanksgiving, thus, is about more than a list of circumstantial pleasures: it is also about incomprehensible mystery. Its about the fact that, despite our cares and pains, we have been given more than we could have ever asked for. We have received more than we could have ever deserved. It is a mysterious grace.Life isnt perfectbut it is good, all the same.

Gratitude sanctifies the world. Gratitude makes the world holy.Nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thankfulness,for it is made holyby the word of God and prayer.
Think about that. Think of everything you possess, everything that is yours in life. How can we live with these things in a way that doesnt entangle us? In a way that isnt sinful?
Receive them as gifts. When we handle the things of the world as gifts they become holy, consecrated and sanctified. Gratitudethankfulnessmarks the boundary between the sacred and the profane.
 Richard Beck, The World is Made Holy Through Thanks
It has seemed to me sometimes as though the Lord breathes on this poor gray ember of Creation and it turns to radiance  for a moment or a year or the span of a life Wherever you turn your eyes the world can shine like transfiguration. You dont have to bring a thing to it except a little willingness to see. Only, who could have the courage to see it?
 Gilead, Marilynne Robinson
InThe Brothers Karamazov,a priest tells the story of his brother, who died as a little boy. One day, his mother finds the little boy crying. When she asks him what is wrong, he responds,
There was such a glory of God all around me; birds, trees, meadows, sky, only Ilived in shame and dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.
You take too many sins on yourself, mother used to say, weeping.
Mother, darling, its for joy, not for grief I am crying, he replied. Though I cant explain it to you, I like to humble myself before them,for I dont know how to love them enough.

The American Conservative,C,A Millman-Walt Dialogue On Foreign Policy | The American Conservative,"Its been a long while since Ive done a bit on bloggingheads.tv, and Im delighted that on my first visit back I got to discuss American foreign policy with Professor Stephen Walt of Harvard.
We talked about Chuck Hagels ouster, how President Obama was captured by the foreign policy establishment, and whether its even possible for American foreign policy to change course in a material way.

You can see the complete video of our exchange here.
Hey  it beats battling the crowds on Black Friday.

The American Conservative,C,Star Wars and Politics | The American Conservative,"Dan Drezner worries about how the next Star Wars film will address political themes:
The new trailer suggests that the Imperial forces have not exactly disappeared, which means that the politics here probably will be about a Rebel Alliance facing growth pains as it tries to actually govern. Although the political scientist in me is intrigued by that narrative possibility , the sci-fi geek in me is petrified that these questions will bore the hell out of me while Im watching  or, worse, enrage me, like Anakin Skywalkers political pontificating.
I should say first that I expect the upcoming Star Wars to suffer from all the many flaws that marred Abrams disaster of a second Star Trek film, not least of which was the very forced attempt to make the story relevant to contemporary debates about terrorism, drones, and related issues. I agree with Seth Masket that it is possible for a movie to address these themes successfully, but I have absolutely no confidence that Abrams knows how to do that. More generally, attempting to make a piece of pop culture relevant to contemporary politics can easily lead to the gross oversimplification of difficult problems, and a tentpole space opera is the wrong place to try doing these things anyway. A post-Empire Star Wars story could ideally have some interesting things to say about the inevitable disorder and upheaval that comes from the violent overthrow of an authoritarian state or the weaknesses and flaws of a very young democratic order that tries to replace it. Unfortunately, the amount of exposition needed to tell that part of the story would make any movie very long or very dull or both. So to the extent that Abrams chooses to indulge in making political arguments in these movies, I assume that they will be just as clumsy and heavy-handed as they were in Into Darkness.

The American Conservative,C,Thanksgiving Doorbusters Backfire on Big Retail | The American Conservative,"This Thanksgiving, Wal-Mart opened at 6 pm, as did Macys, Target, Kohls, Sears, Belk, and Sports Authority. Dicks Sporting Goods opened at 5, along with Best Buy, Toys R Us, and JCPenney.
Many decried the invasion of Thanksgiving Day itself by the teeming hordes of Black Friday doorbuster deals, and some even called for boycotts of stores that tore employees from their families on what was declared to be a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. But few, I would suspect, held high hopes that their efforts could even slow the unleashed passions of American consumerism as retailers competed to chip away at Thanksgivings protected status year after year.
This year, however, something funny happened: sales slumped.
Industry group the National Retail Federation had been predicting strong growth for this kickoff to the holiday shopping seasons, but reported yesterday that sales from the entire Thanksgiving weekend, Thursday through Sunday, fell by 11 percent, while the number of shoppers venturing out over the weekend fell by 5 percent. According to the New York Times, Executives at the retail federation  appeared at a loss to fully explain the drop-off. Some pointed to early sales, others to the possibility that the recession still lingers. At the same time, they argued that significantly lower fuel prices and a strengthened economy kept people from being reduced to scrapping for bargains.
Perhaps the numbers are simply an inexplicable blip.But at least for now, we may have a concrete data point of possible hope in the seemingly doomed struggle against commerces march upon our culture.
Brandon McGinley wrote that expressed concerns about Black Friday consumerism was in fact classist condescension as Many upper-middle class Americans simply cannot comprehend that Black Friday might be the only day when one can afford a modest luxury. One gets the sense from his article that he sees cohorts of blue-blooded WASPs condescending to the great unwashed masses who venture out to snap up discounts. And there surely were some WASPish blue-bloods who so condescended.
But the numbers generally do not bear out the idea that opposition to consumerism is a classist exercise. According to the National Retail Federation, people with incomes over $50,000 (roughly the national median) were in factmore likely to shop over the weekend than those with incomes below that mark, 60 percent to 50 percent. And the breakdown of when consumers first braved the retailing crowds shows the two sides of America to be virtually indistinguishable. And while I grant that a more granular breakdown of the data could tease out more differences, I would not be surprised to see the general trend hold.
Lets hope that this years numbers spook the big retailers, and makes the prospect of extending, or even continuing, the hours that they must pay time-and-a-half to their entire workforce too risky a proposition. For in the rhythm of national life, we should be able to take one day away from our normal pattern of purchasing in order that all but the most essential workers may gather with family and offer Thanksgiving and Praise. The retail worker, which is the most common occupation in every one of the fifty states, should not be broken from that national rhythm simply because capitalisms actors find themselves incapable of refraining from eating away at those institutions upon which capitalism depends.
As I wrote after last Christmas,
The true costs of consumerism may not come from the seeking of happiness in material goods. That is a story as old as time, and most of us come to grips with its emptiness at one point or another. Instead, it may be the impressing of the whole world into the service of our desires and convenience, reducing the people we rely on to a mere means of our satisfaction.
For at least a day, lets hold out hope that consumerism overextended itself, and finally found a point of exhaustion from which we can begin even the smallest of recoveries. Happy Advent.

The American Conservative,C,"And Now, For Something Completely Different  Or Perhaps Not | The American Conservative","Before tackling more serious subjects today (like my absurd backlog of theater write-ups), I wanted to briefly touch on Damon Linkers latest column, about how traditional religion would adapt to the discovery of intelligent extraterrestrial life. In Linkers view: not well.
Just as the scientific Copernican Revolution destabilized and downgraded humanitys place in the cosmos by substituting heliocentrism for a geocentric view that placed the Earth and its inhabitants at the center of creation, so the discovery of advanced life on other planets would imply that human beings are just one of any number of intelligent creatures in the universe. And that, in turn, would seem to imply either that God created many equally special beings throughout the universe, or that God cares for us more than he does for those other intelligent beings. How the latter view could be rendered compatible with basic tenets of monotheism (including divine omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence) is beyond me. Did God create those other intelligent creatures, too, but without an interest in revealing himself to them? Or did they, unlike human beings, evolve all on their own without divine origins and guidance? . . . But I have an equally hard time accepting that believers would be capable of wrapping their heads around the possibility that God loves all intelligent creatures on all planets equally. Does God send Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed to visit other worlds to deliver the same moral and theological revelations? Or does he raise up analogous prophets  and in the case of Christianity, incarnate himself in extraterrestrial species  in order to spread his message to everyone throughout the universe who is capable of receiving it? I suspect that these puzzles are so corrosive in their skeptical implications that contact with intelligent life from other worlds would produce a rapid collapse of faith rooted in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran, with a rapid spread of atheistic secularism in their place.
I love topics like this, because they dont matter at all  and, because they dont matter at all, they may reveal hidden assumptions more effectively than subjects that actually do matter. In this case: assumptions about what makes religions tick, what drives their success or failure. Linker assumes, implicitly, that unpleasant or unexpected facts are a profound threat to traditional religion. But the evidence for this is surprisingly limited. Lets begin with the non-Abrahamic religious traditions: Hinduism, Buddhism, traditional Chinese religion, African animist beliefs, etc. Its not clear that the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe would pose any kind of challenge to these traditions. Indeed, the bulk of scientific discoveries about human origins and development are more readily compatible with these traditions than they are with Judaism, Christianity or Islam. You would think, therefore, that the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions would have already put the wind in the sails of these non-Abrahamic traditions, and hobbled the growth of Christianity and Islam. But precisely the opposite has been the case: both Christianity and Islam have continued to spread, and make converts across Asia and Africa. Next: lets look at what Christianity specifically has already assimilated or resisted successfully. It has, as noted, survived overwhelming scientific evidence that humanity was not created immaculately in its current form, but arose through the process of evolutionby natural selection  i.e., by surviving in a brutal contest for survival with other species. It has also survived the transition from a heliocentric worldview to one in which the Earth is an almost invisibly small speck in the corner of a galaxy that is itself only a tiny part of an incomprehensibly vast universe. But before that, it survived three more profound challenges:

The encounter with America. Linker thinks it would be devastating to Christianity to reckon with the reality of intelligent beings that either never experienced Gods love through revelation and incarnation, or who experienced those things through a separate revelation and/or incarnation. But Christianity had to reckon with that reality five hundred years ago. And its still here.
The rise of Islam. Which is a more troubling fact for Christianity: the possibility that the biblical account of creation is profoundly inaccurate, or the possibility that another religion has the true revelation? Well, when Islam swept over the Christian holy land, and went on to conquer much of the known world, Christians were faced with that question. Christianity has still not really formulated a coherent theological response to the rise of Islam, at least not in my view. But Christianity has survived and thrived despite that failure.
The death of Jesus of Nazareth. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Christianity is founded on the prima facie absurd notion that when your leader and hoped-for messiah is captured, tortured, and executed, that this isgood news. It is a religion founded on the complete failure of normal, rational expectations, and consequently a complete revaluation of the meaning of plain facts. Thats what Christianity was at its origins. And were supposed to believe that this religion wouldnt be able to handle a few little green men?

Now, Im not going to argue that any of the above proves that Christianity would have no trouble surviving an encounter with extraterrestrial life. But I do think it proves that we can make no easy assumptions about what might or might not pose an insurmountable challenge to any particular religious tradition. Religions do not grow and shrink in response to reasoned analysis. Their origins are mysterious and their subsequent trajectories are the function of too many variables to be easily teased out. Why did Mohammeds conquests lead to the formation of a new world religion, while Genghis Khans did not? Why did Jesus beat out Mithra in the contest to succeed Roman paganism? Why was there any such contest in the first place? What, for that matter, do the Abrahamic religions offer that is so appealing that they continue to grow at the expense of non-Abrahamic traditions that, objectively speaking, require much less of a leap of faith, much less suspension of disbelief in the objectively absurd? I dont know the answer to these questions. But they have more bearing on the prospective future of Christianity  and what that future will look like  than the possibility that Christianity will seem absurd in the face of this or that scientific development. Even so revolutionary a development as the encounter with extraterrestrial intelligence. UPDATE: For those of you unfamiliar with the book that the image above is taken from, here it is.

The American Conservative,C,Cotton and the Iran Hawks Loathing of Diplomacy | The American Conservative,"Incoming Republican Senator Tom Cotton is refreshingly candid about his hostility to diplomacy with Iran:
I hope that Congress role will be to put an end to these negotiations.
Specifically, he wants Congress to violate the terms of the interim agreement so that the U.S. will be the party responsible for the breakdown in talks. Despite the fact that Iran has so far complied with the terms of the interim agreement, Cotton wants the U.S. to ignore its commitments. Its worth noting here that hawks are never concerned about lost credibility when it comes to violating international agreements. Ending the negotiations would free Iran from the constraints of the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA), which has so far succeeded in making it more difficult for Iran to build a nuclear weapon in the future than if there had been no interim agreement. 
Cotton claims that Iran is getting everything it wants, but that is far from true. When the extension of talks was announced last month, Paul Pillar explained why the U.S. benefited the most:
Our sidethe United States and its partners in the P5+1got by far the better side of the deal in the JPOA. We got the fundamental bomb-preventing restrictions (including most significantly a complete elimination of medium-level uranium enrichment) and enhanced inspections we sought, in return for only minor sanctions relief to Iran that leaves all the major banking and oil sanctions in place. If negotiations were to go on forever under these terms, we would have no cause to complain to the Iranians.
Cotton is a typical Iran hawk in that he is intensely opposed to the diplomatic effort that has already made a nuclear-armed Iran less likely. His objection to the negotiations doesnt seem to be based on the details of the current agreement, but stems instead from a reflexive rejection of diplomatic engagement with unsavory regimes. Like most hard-liners, Cotton simply asserts that the other side is getting the best of the deal because this is what hard-liners normally assume about any negotiation. The greatest danger for a hard-liner on Iran is the possibility that a final agreement could be reached that satisfies all parties and shows that successful diplomacy with Iran is possible, so it is understandable that hard-liners are prepared to do what they can to sabotage negotiations.

The American Conservative,C,Bringing Big Data to the Farm | The American Conservative,"Can family farmers use technology to survive? Quentin Hardy thinks soin a Sunday article for the New York Times, he writesof generational farmers who are increasingly relying on data and drones to succeed:

The demise of the small family farm has been a long time coming. But for farmers like Mr. Tom, technology offers a lifeline, a way to navigate the boom-and-bust cycles of making a living from the land. It is also helping them grow to compete with giant agribusinesses.

The idea of farmers using technology to catch up with Big Ag isnt necessarily a bad thingbut there may be unintended consequences.
First, its important to note that this type of farming encourages farmers to consolidate their farms to one specific crop, thus fighting against the principles of diversity that help keep farmland healthy. As Hardy puts it,
There is an incentive to grow single crops to maximize the effectiveness of technology by growing them at the largest possible scale. Farmers with diverse crops and livestock would need many different systems. Smaller farmers without technology could also grow one crop, but they would not capture most of the gains.
Technology encourages farmers to move too aggressively toward easy-to-grow and easy-to-sell crops that are more easily measured by instruments, rather than keeping some diversity in the fields  an age-old hedge against bad weather and pests
Farmers cant afford to buy the amount of equipment that would be necessary to keep up with a diverse farm via technology. Yet if they dont diversify, it can have a deleterious effect on their soilnot to mention the effect it can have on their livelihood, if that crop fails.
Also, note that this sort of specification requires farmers to a) have a more diverse set of skills, and b) to rely on a greater variety of outside support.It used to be, if you could turn a wrench youd be good at farming, Mr. Burbrink told the Times. Now you need to know screen navigation, and pinpointing what data should go where so people can plan and predict. You need to be in tune with other people: seed consultants, agronomists, the equipment folks.
In his book Gaining Ground, seventh-generation family farmer Forrest Pritchard wrote of the long-term costs that can result fromrelying on technology. Selling equipment and using simpler processes actually saved Pritchard moneyhe didnt have to invest as much in the upkeep and maintenance of various piece of equipment. So even if equipment helps a farm grow bigger, it will also make the upkeep a lot more complicated.
Finally, using technology to expand a farm could have long-term consequences, because it can stretch a farm past its natural limits. There is a reason small farms are growing more popular: the more human-scale the enterprise, the higher quality the product. Farms that try to do too much, or grow too big, often badly impact the quality of both their crops and their personal lives. Its important to consider whether bigger is always better. Perhaps family farmers shouldnt be trying so hard to compete with the big guysthere is a burgeoning market for smaller, sustainably-farmed enterprises. And by tapping into that market, farmers can keep things to a smaller, more healthy scale, without seeing their sales completely fall apart. Of course each area of the United States is unique and different, but it is true that this sort of local production is growing in demand.
Why does all this matter so much? Agriculture in America is changing, restructuring itself to survive in the midst of new technology, aging agrarians, and a changing consumer base. The way that farms modify their methodology will directly impact the future of the agricultural enterprise as a whole. We may have a resurrection of the small, sustainably-produced family farm. Or we may have large, drone-run commodity farms. Perhaps both can live in harmony togetherthat remains to be seen. But it is important that the former are not completely destroyed by the latter.

The American Conservative,C,Declaring War on ISIS | The American Conservative,"Emma Roller reports on Rand Pauls proposed declaration of war against ISIS:
And by introducing what would be the first declaration of war to come out of Congress since World War II, Paul is backing up the claim hes been trying to prove over the past six months: that he is a conservative realist who is skeptical, but not afraid of intervention.
If the war against ISIS is going to continue, it is better that Congress authorize it or, in this case, formally declare war, but I do find it a bit strange to view this and other similar proposals in Congress as a meaningful check on the president. The administration has made clear that it doesnt think it needs Congress approval to wage the war against ISIS, and it isnt going to respect any Congressional action that doesnt approve of what the president decided to do months ago. An authorization or declaration at this point would do little more than endorse a war that will continue no matter what Congress does or doesnt do.
Setting a one-year expiration on such a declaration makes sense, since that would require Congress to reconsider its support, but who thinks that the administration would end hostilities if Congress chose not to reauthorize the war? It would deny that it needed Congress approval in the first place, but would cite the first vote in favor of authorization as justification enough to continue the war for as long as it wanted. In the event that Congress voted against authorizing force or declaring war, the war would not stop unless the no voters were also prepared to deprive the war of funds, which is even less likely to happen than a no vote. It is right for Pauls proposal to mostly rule out ground forces in combat, but again what is going to stop the administration from ignoring this restriction in practice if it deems it appropriate?
Put bluntly, it isnt much of a reassertion of Congressional authority or responsibility to acquiesce to a war illegally launched by the president. Even if this is done through a formal declaration of war, it is still a matter of signing off on a war that the president already started by himself. As a matter of policy, a declaration of war commits those voting yes to support an ill-conceived and unnecessary military operation. Passing such a measure would confirm that presidents can start wars illegally and that they will then have their illegal decisions endorsed by Congress after the fact. If there is to be a vote on the war against ISIS, Congress should vote no.

President Barack Obama is a champion of using video cameras to prevent and expose misconduct by uniformed people with guns. He is also a great believer in banning the use of torture on detainees in the war on terror. It may come as a surprise, then, to find that he doesn't want to release videos of Guantanamo inmates being force-fed.Force-feeding of prisoners is generally recognized as a cruel practice. Obama has expressed reservations about it even as he has approved its continued use. The logic of his two positions comes right out of ""Alice in Wonderland"": If the images never become public, there is no evidence that he allows torture.But the images may become public despite his preference. In October, a federal judge who has watched the videos said the government had no adequate reason to keep them secret and ordered their release. This week, the Justice Department appealed that verdict, in hopes of concealing from the American people the tender mercies accorded the hapless Guantanamo captives.The ruling concerns a 43-year-old Syrian named Abu Wa'el Dhiab, who has been locked up without a trial since 2002. He ought to be a free man by now: Four years ago, an administration review board authorized letting him go.But the Pentagon fears sending him back to Syria, where he was sentenced to death in absentia for alleged terrorist activities. It delayed so long on an offer by the government of Uruguay to take him that the deal collapsed. So he remains in Guantanamo and, for all he knows, may remain there forever.His only way of protesting this unhappy fate was to go on a hunger strike. But the Defense Department doesn't take kindly to inmates being uncooperative and putting their health at risk. So he and other hunger strikers have been deprived of the choice whether to take nourishment.Twice each day, Dhiab is strapped into a restraint chair so a tube can be forced into his nose and down his throat to allow a nutritional drink to be poured into his stomach. His lawyers say the procedure is painful and dangerous, a claim the judge rejected.Doctors may disagree. ""During my training, I placed countless feeding tubes,"" wrote Kent Sepkowitz, an internist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, in The Daily Beast. ""Without question, it is the most painful procedure doctors routinely inflict on conscious patients."" He added: ""The procedure is, in a word, barbaric. And that's when we are trying to be nice.""Guantanamo personnel may not try so hard. Lawyers for the inmates accuse them of inflicting unnecessary suffering to punish the recalcitrant.In any event, the practice is impossible to justify. The UN Human Rights Commission classifies it as torture, and the World Medical Association is on record saying, ""Forcible feeding is never ethically acceptable.""It's not just mushy-headed foreigners who take this view. An independent panel led by former Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and James Jones, D-Okla., issued a report last year condemning the practice. ""Forced feeding of detainees is a form of abuse and must end,"" said the group. If the administration believes the practice is humane, it ought to release the videos and prove it.The president insists he wants to put the prison out of business. ""Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe,"" he has said. ""It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed."" In the meantime, though, ""I don't want these individuals to die.""But if we can't find a way to discharge inmates who have been approved for transfer, that decision should be up to them. Just as medical personnel may not force lifesaving medical treatments on unwilling patients -- even prisoners -- they may not force sustenance on them just to keep them alive.Even if it were appropriate to use force-feeding to prevent death, that's not actually the custom of Gitmo, where prisoners are subjected to it long before their lives are in jeopardy. But if an inmate thinks he is better off starving himself to death than facing the prospect of indefinite confinement, he might just be right.Some Americans think Dhiab should leave the detention facility only in a pine box. If he wants to accommodate them sooner rather than later, let him.

December, a time for choral concerts, band performances, orchestra recitals, cocktail parties, holiday markets, family gatherings and final exams. Almost everyone is overbooked and overworked, exhausted and running on empty. Busy schedules lead to being away from home one night after the other, to the detriment of family dinners, early bedtimes and balanced meals.The temptations of food and drink are too enticing to ignore. Rich food, sweet succulent desserts and holiday cocktails tantalize our taste buds and lead us into temptation and indulgence -- and then to nights of unsound sleep. In my case, I often awaken the next morning filled with regret -- wishing I had passed over the delectable treats, stayed at home and indulged in a bubble bath instead.While we make time for others this Advent season, we should also make time for ourselves. We all need a few minutes to pause and relax, indulge in inactivity and create a lull rather than labor in liveliness. This indulgent pause that should refresh should be a moment to stand back and take stock of the miracles of Christmas that happen every minute of every day. The small miracles can include being the recipient of a stranger's kindness or a pet's attention, getting a hug from a loved one or finding the perfect present for a friend. This reflection on finding a spark of the divine can be expanded to the people we encounter along the way, in the paths of our lives.The spark of love, potential and possibility reside in everyone we know, everyone we love and even everyone we hate. Sometimes the spark flickers under damage caused by the trauma and tribulations of the lives we have led. The spark might be buried under ashes so deep that it cannot be seen until the ashes are blown away. But the spark is always there, even if it is hard to find.The challenge in front of us during this holiday time is to pause to recognize the spark of life and light, and therefore the spark of God, in others. Before this can happen, we must pause first to recognize and embrace the same brightness and lightness within ourselves.If we believe that there is a spark of divinity in every one of us, then we know that we too hold a spark of the divine. All too often we look for the flaws within ourselves (in my case, they're not hard to find). Such soul-searching often leads to the recognition of spheres that need to be improved or fixed. But a single-minded focus on continual improvement can keep us from recognizing that we all contain shining, sunny spots, too.These spots are often easiest to find in those we love and care for, my children, my husband, all three who bring joy and laughter into my life on a daily basis. They are also often the ones to remind me that there is some good buried under my ashes after all. Those sunny spots are located within all of us -- even if they are buried under damage caused by trauma, invisible until the ashes are blown away to reveal the bright embers that are still there.It's the challenging people that require a new angle of thinking, moving away from our own preformed framework, into a more wide-eyed view of what might possibly just be. Taking a pause and allowing a slower pace, enabling a release of one framework and opening into other thoughts and perspectives provides space for us to view even those who challenge us, as a gift from above. What better way to get us to focus on our patience, humility and humanity than to put us in difficult situations? After all, Jesus was not born in a Ritz Carlton on silk sheets, but rather in a manger, surrounded by hay. The value of a pause is that it allows us to blow away the ashes that may be covering up the embers. It lets us look for the best, in ourselves and then in others, to understand that everyone -- even ourselves -- contains a spark of holiness, the image of God.During this busy season, use the power of a pause to see God in others, and in yourself.

 What is Bitcoin, how does it work, and can it revolutionize government?Peter Van Valkenburg reports for the December issue of Townhall Magazine.Bitcoin is going mainstream.  No longer the exclusive toy of fringe political movements, basement dwellers, and assorted ne'er do wells, Bitcoins gaining the sincere admiration of some heavy hitters in the world of technology, politics, and economics. Where once it was just the likes of former-Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) calling for Bitcoin to be perfectly legal, now Googles CEO, Eric Schmidt, has called it a remarkable cryptographic achievement with enormous value, and former-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said it may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure, and more efficient payment system. Hype aside, its important to understand just how these technologies work and why they could be a force for greater liberty and prosperity in our time.   What is Bitcoin and How Does It Work? First off, Bitcoin is both a payments network on the Internetthats Bitcoin with a capital Band the coins or tokens of value that flow through that networkbitcoin(s) with a lower case B. Bitcoin is correctly referred to as a decentralized cryptocurrency. Those words are packed with meaning. In order to understand Bitcoin, lets look carefully at decentralized, crypto, and currency individually.   DecentralizedDecentralized, in this case, means that the currency is not controlled by a single entity, like a corporation, bank, or government. Instead, it is created and maintained by the interactions of many individual persons or businesses that join the Bitcoin network on the Internet. This is not as strange as it may sound. The English language, like Bitcoin, is an extremely valuable tool but no single group or individual controls what is and isn't English. Words are invented by individuals and adopted, or not adopted, by the English-speaking world. Particular sentence structures may be improper at some points in history, as when a preposition is what a sentence ends with. But those rules may change, disappearas with never start a sentence with butor reappear depending on the attitudes and choices of the many individual speakers of English.  Bitcoin is like a language. Its users, the Bitcoin network, all use computer software that speaks the same language, the Bitcoin protocol, and if enough users decide to change the way it's spoken by tweaking their software, then the protocol changes. But because everyone on that network is invested in Bitcoin, it's extremely unlikely that any change would be adopted if that change made Bitcoin less secure. Just like English, there are plenty of people on the Bitcoin network ready to step in and criticize poor Bitcoin grammar, spelling, or the too-artful use of a word.   CryptoThe ""crypto"" in cryptocurrency isn't anything related to the Loch Ness Monster or the basement of a cathedral. It comes from ""cryptography,"" the art and science of keeping secrets using math. Cryptography's been around since at least the ancient Romans, whose generals scrambled messages on scrolls to communicate in the field.  Public key cryptography is the particular, recent cryptographic innovation that has made things like Bitcoin possible, and it's also the technology used when you send your credit card information over the Internet to buy things on Amazon.  Public key cryptography allows Bitcoin users to see but not impersonate each other. Everyone with bitcoins has a public address. Think of it like an account number. Everyone on the network can see how many bitcoins are in all the different public addresses, but they can never impersonate the owner of another address in order to steal those coins. Each public address has a private key. Think of it like a password, and only the person with that password can move Bitcoins out of that account.   The full list of balances for all these accounts, from accounts holding tiny fractions of a Bitcoin to accounts with millions of dollars worth, is kept in a large publicly shared spreadsheet called the blockchain. When I give two of my Bitcoins to a friend, I'm really just using an app on my phone, called a Bitcoin wallet, to tell the Bitcoin network that my address is now two bitcoins poorer and my friend's address is now two bitcoins richer. The people on the network listen for my announcement, and some of those people, called miners, set their computers to compete to be the first to record those new balances in the blockchainthe list of all balances.  A miner will only record my transfer to my friend if I had at least two bitcoins in my address to begin withotherwise I'd be sending money I didn't ownand the miners computer knows that I door don't have those bitcoins because my initial balance was listed in the blockchain. The miners computer knows that I am the person that has the right to give up those bitcoins because I signed my announcement using my secret private key, something that only I have.  But, why would a miner spend the effort to write my transaction in the ledger? The miner does this because she can put 25 new bitcoins in her own public address if she's the first to record all the transactions that take place within a 10-minute period, and also the first to solve a difficult math problem that was set up by the last miner to win the reward. In short, miners compete to honestly record transactions across the network so that the network will reward them with new bitcoins. That, in total, is how Bitcoin works. Theres a big public ledger describing who has which bitcoinsthe blockchain. There are miners who update that ledger in return for rewards of new bitcoins. And the only person who can ask for the ledger to show that bitcoins have moved from one address to another is the person with the private key to the public address that holds those coins. CurrencyNow that weve talked about how bitcoins can be sent and received, one big question still remains: Why is a bitcoin valuable? The answer is surprisingly simple. Its valuable because it is scarce and demanded. People demand bitcoin for all sorts of reasons: They might want to invest in it because they expect the price to rise; they might want to hold some in order to buy products on the Internet; or, send it to a friend to satisfy a debt.   Bitcoin is scarce because there are only so many bitcoins that exist in the world. As discussed, bitcoins can only be sent by people who already hold them in their public address. You cant just print up new bitcoins in order to send them; someone needs to send them to you first, or you need to buy them from an exchange. Miners, its true, are rewarded with new bitcoins whenever they faithfully list new transactions on the blockchain. These rewards, however, are set to diminish as time goes on, and ultimately only about 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.   Not as Hard to Use as It Sounds Bitcoin's not as difficult to use as all this explanation may suggest. Its true that until recently a bitcoin was pretty complicated to purchase, hold, or send. Thats mostly because it was a new technological innovation made by savvy people without too much attention paid to the user experience. The same thing could have been said about the Internet in 1995, but today thats clearly not the case.  The Internet became easy to use because innovative companies built web browsers like Netscape, Firefox, and Chrome. These programs connected to the Internet and could display information on the network as visual layouts, webpages, rather than raw computer code or ordinary text. Eventually, other companies built graphics-rich websites that a user could visit with her browser in order to read, watch, and interact with content, all without even thinking about the complicated networks of ones and zeros that lay beneath it.  The same thing is now happening with Bitcoin. A number of companies and software designers have started making Bitcoin as easy to use as online banking and shopping websites. The communication on the Bitcoin network looks the same, a bunch of seemingly random letters, numbers, and math, but the user sees a webpage or smartphone app attractively displaying their bitcoin balance alongside a button to cash out that balance into dollars sent to their bank account, and another button to send or request payment in bitcoins from a friend. Giving the Fed Some Healthy CompetitionBitcoin is not replacing the dollar bill, and probably never will. It can, however, compete. Central banks hold a great deal of power. Increasing the money supply of a central bank like the Fed can cheapen the dollars in the pockets of every American. By failing to conform its behavior to market expectations, a central bank can cause shocks to the economy. Advocates seeking to audit the Fed want to use transparency to help rein in these abuses, if and when they emerge.  Oversight is, however, not a silver bullet. Monetary theory is complicated stuff, and its difficult to say who might even be qualified to authoritatively criticize certain decisions.  A better alternative is having alternatives.  If Americans can easily use Bitcoin rather than dollars then thats all the more incentive for the Fed to get it right and not screw around. Debase the dollar and youll only lose dollar-users to the bitcoin market. Until virtual currency, the only viable alternative to dollars was using foreign currency from other nations. Trouble is, not many corner stores in downtown Des Moines take Brazilian real or Vietnamese dong as payment. Moreover, foreign currencies merely repeat the dilemma with dollars: If the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has questionable credibility then its doubtful the central bank of India ormore obviouslyZimbabwe would be much of an improvement.  Bitcoin should be celebrated for bringing real alternatives to otherwise monopolistic money printers, andjust maybegiving Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen another reason to get it right.   Terrorists are Not Impressed  The ease with which Bitcoin can be transmitted overseas seemingly makes it an attractive choice for those sending funds to international criminals or, worse, terrorists. Thus far, however, that threat has yet to materialize. Edward Lowery, special agent for the American Secret Service, recently testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on the subject of virtual currency and crime. He observed that within what we see in our investigations, the online cybercriminals, the high-level international cybercriminals we are talking about, have not, by and large, gravitated towards the peer-to-peer crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin.  Why are criminals reticent to use Bitcoin? Ultimately its hard to say, but the fully public ledger might have something to do with it. Bitcoins move from public address to public address on the blockchain. Those public addresses are just long strings of random numbers and letters that uniquely identify particular holders of coins. The name of that holder, however, is not public. In other words, Bitcoin, like many fine novels, is pseudonymous.  This doesnt mean, however, that its particularly easy to hide ones transfers from authorities. At some point in a string of transactions the bitcoin will often need to be exchanged for dollars, pesos, or rupees. Exchange services generally collect a great deal of data about their users including credit card numbers, bank accounts, names, addresses, and IP addresses. Therefore it can be easy to put a name and location to a public address that purchased bitcoins on an exchange.  If the authorities have reason to suspect this person, then transfers to and from his address can be investigated. If the users of those linked addresses ever purchased bitcoins on an exchange, spent bitcoins with an online merchant that captured their computers IP address, or spent coins at a physical merchant that had security cameras, then they too can be identified. Gradually, police and counterterrorism agents might be able to identify an entire network of users. At this point the authorities would have perfect visibility into all the transactions and funding mechanisms used by the particular criminal network. The agents can now wait until a transaction indicates an opportune time and place to arrest a network participant and repeat the procedure for each linked suspect. This stands in stark contrast to centralized money transmitters that keep closed books and locate in obscure jurisdictions to avoid the scrutiny of regulators and law enforcement. It stands in even starker contrast to plain old cash, good-old greenbacks, which leave no record of transactions, not even a pseudonymous one. In the world of crime, cashpreferably a whole pallet of it in the belly of a container ship with a less than honorable captainremains king.  Bitcoin and Smaller GovernmentAs revolutionary as Bitcoin already is, many of the truly thrilling uses of cryptocurrency are still on the horizon. These innovations are collectively referred to as Bitcoin 2.0 and they have tremendous potential to bolster commerce, liberty, and free exchange.  The Bitcoin protocol uses blockchains to transmit value authoritatively from one public address to another. But the blockchain is, essentially, nothing more than an open, trusted ledger. Accordingly, blockchains could be used to create authoritative records for any purpose. A blockchain could be used to build a decentralized property registry where users can publically store and transfer title to their cars or their homes. The keys to many vehicles already have embedded chips and use cryptography to prevent unauthorized access. Using a blockchain, the key-code could be transferred from seller to buyer as a digital asset over the Internet. When the buyer sends bitcoin to the seller, the buyer can automatically receive, in return, an ignition code and the ability to start the car with his smartphone.  A blockchain could also be used to create and transfer tokens that represent shares of a corporation, a stake in the outcome of a civil suit, or the payout on an insurance policy. Blockchains can even be used to memorialize and automatically carry out complicated contracts between individuals. The language of a bitcoin transaction can be more advanced than Alice sends two bitcoins to Bob. It can include agreements by multiple parties, at designated dates, and times. For example, Alice commits two bitcoins to Bob UNLESS Bob fails to deliver his car to Alice by November 1st at noon, AND Charlie, the arbitrator, agrees that the failure is Bobs fault.  These technologies would lower the cost of governance. A humble country lawyer with some Bitcoin-coding knowledge could help the owner of a small business sell shares of her company to investors without a stock exchange, or help a couple transfer the deed to their house without costly title insurance companies. The same lawyer could build contracts for a local businessman that would self-enforce, automatically adjusting grain prices to reflect global markets or automatically demanding a resolution from an appointed arbitrator if the parties disagreed.  Putting the power of these governance tools into the hands of local lawyers and entrepreneurs reduces our dependence on large, inefficient central governments and corporations to validate and enforce our agreements or property rights. The future of governance with Bitcoin 2.0 looks less like the bureaucratic expansion of the late 20th century and more like the common law systems of earlier centuries. Peace and order are maintained not because a centralized authority is surveilling and policing the land, but, instead, because virtuous individuals are able to establish trust within their communities using the local legal tools of smart contracts and smart property, while the less-than-virtuous suffer as mathematical systems of agreement and ownership become ever more resistant to fraud and manipulation.Peter Van Valkenburg is the director of research for the Coin Center, a non-profit dedicated to issues facing cryptocurrency technologies, such as Bitcoin.

Can Racial Discrimination Explain Much?

In the medical profession, there is the admonition primum non nocere, the Latin expression for ""first, do no harm."" In order not to do harm, at the minimum, requires accurate diagnostics. Suppose a patient presents with abdominal pains, and the physician diagnoses it as caused by the patient's ingrown toenails. If that isn't the cause, the physician can spend all the resources he wants treating the patient's ingrown toenails and not remedy the patient's abdominal pains.The decency of accurate diagnosis should be given to analyzing the problems of a large segment of the black community. Very often, major problems are erroneously seen as being caused by racial discrimination. No one argues that racial discrimination does not exist or does not have effects. The question that's relevant to policy, as well as resource allocation, is: How much of what we see is caused by discrimination?Let's apply this question to the tragic state of black education. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, sometimes called the nation's report card, the average black 12th-grader has the academic achievement level of the average white seventh- or eighth-grader. In some cities, there's even a larger achievement gap. If, as some people assert, this is the result of racially discriminatory education funding, then demonstrations, legal suits and other measures might be taken to promote funding equity. Also, resources could be spent to politically organize and elect black people as mayors, city councilors and school superintendents.If the cause of the black/white achievement gap has little to do with racial discrimination, then focusing on discrimination will lead us to ignore or downplay factors that do affect black education. In some school districts, 700 teachers are annually assaulted and threatened. At one time, Philadelphia employed 500 school police officers. Similar stories of school violence can be told in other cities with large black populations, such as Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, Cleveland, Oakland, California, and Newark, New Jersey. How useful is it to spend resources on discrimination while allowing unsafe and chaotic educational environments to exist?Whether a student is black, white, orange or polka-dot and whether he's poor or rich, there are some minimum requirements that must be met in order for him to do well in school. Someone must make the student do his homework. Someone must see to it that he gets eight to nine hours of sleep. Someone has to fix him a wholesome breakfast and ensure that he gets to school on time and respects and obeys teachers. Here's my question: Which one of those basic requirements can be accomplished through a presidential executive order, a congressional mandate or the edict of a mayor, a superintendent of schools or a teacher? If those basic requirements aren't met, whatever else that is done in the name of education is for naught.Spending more money on education is not a substitute. If it were, black academic achievement wouldn't be a problem. For example, in 2012, Washington, D.C., public schools led the nation in spending per pupil, at $29,409 (http://tinyurl.com/mpc82dq). In terms of academic performance, ""the nation's report card"" shows that over 80 percent of D.C.'s predominantly black eighth-graders scored either ""basic"" or ""below basic"" in reading and math. ""Basic"" indicates only partial mastery of the knowledge and skills fundamental for proficient work at grade level, and ""below basic"" means that the student doesn't even have partial mastery.Other devastating problems that are faced by many blacks and cannot be attributed to racial discrimination are a high crime rate -- featured by a homicide victimization rate of 51 percent -- over 70 percent of blacks being born to single females and only slightly more than 30 percent of black children being raised in two-parent households.Solutions to these truly challenging problems will not be found in the political arena or in government programs. For black politicians, civil rights leaders, the intellectual elite and others to blame racial discrimination for the problems of today is dereliction. If a medical practitioner made the same kind of incorrect diagnosis, we'd indict him for malpractice.

Europe Is Way Behind the United States... And Here's Why

The United States is burdened with some very bad policies that hinder growth andundermine competitiveness. But sometimes you can win a race if your rivals have policies that are even more self-destructive.And thats a good description of why the U.S. economy is out-performing Europe and why people in the United States enjoy higher living standards than their European counterparts.In 2010, I shared data showing that Americans had far higher levels of consumption than Europeans.In 2012, I updated the numbers and showed once again that people in America far ahead of folks in Europe.And here are the most recent numbers from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, showing average individual consumption for various member nations of that international bureaucracy.The average for all OECD nations is 100, and the average for eurozone nations is 96, so the U.S. score of 147 illustrates how much better off Americans are than citizens of other countries.The only nations that are even close to the United States have oil (like Norway) or are low-tax international financial centers (such as Luxembourg and Switzerland).So why is the United States doing better than Europe?There are two responses.First, notwithstanding what Ive just written, its a bit misleading to compare the U.S. to Europe. Simply stated, there are vast differences among European nations in terms of policies and living standards, much more than you find between and among American states.There are nations such as Switzerland and Finland, for instance, that rank above the United States inEconomic Freedom of the World. But there are also highly statist and moribund countries such as France,Italy, and Greece, as well as transition economies in Eastern Europe that are still trying to catch up after decades of communist oppression.So overall America-vs-Europe comparisons should be accompanied by a grain of salt.Second, now that weve ingested some salt, lets draw some general conclusions about the role of public policy. Most important, nations with bigger governments and more intervention (as is the case for many European countries) generally dont grow as fast or have the same living standards as nations with smaller governments and more reliance on competitive markets.The comparisons can get complicated because there are a wide range of policies that impact economic performance (many people focus on fiscal policy, but trade, regulation, monetary policy, and the rule of law are equally important). Comparisons also can get confusing because there are some relatively rich nations with bad policy and some relatively poor nations with good policy, which is why it is important to look at how rich or poor nations are (or were) when there were significant changes in policy.For instance, many nations in Western Europe became relatively rich in the 1800s and early 1900s when the overall burden of government was very small. Now theyve adopted welfare states and growth is much slower (or, in some cases, nonexistent), but theyre oftentimes still in better shape than nations (such as Estonia and Chile) that only recently have liberalized their economies.Now that weve gone through all this background, lets look at a couple of stories that make me pessimistic about Europes future because they capture the mentality that seems dominant among continental policy makers.First, one of the bright spots for the continent is that theres been vigorous corporate tax competition. In other words, politicians have been under pressure to lower tax burdens on the business community because of concerns that jobs and investment will migrate to nations with better policy.As you can imagine, this irks the political class (even though lower rates havent resulted in less revenue!).So you wont be surprised to learn that theres a new push for tax harmonization in Europe. Here are some of the details from a news report.France, Germany and Italy have joined forces to outlaw tax competition between EU countries in a letter to the European Commission. the language and tone in the joint letter to the new Economic and Taxation Commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, is much more aggressive than in the past. the letter from the finance ministers of the eurozones three largest economies says that the lack of tax harmonisation in the European Union is one of the main causes allowing aggressive tax planning, base erosion and profit-shifting to develop. Vanessa Mock, commission spokeswoman said Mr Moscovici welcomes these significant contributions to the work being carried out by the commission.Hmmm., the Frenchmen who is the Economic and Taxation Commissioner welcomes a call from the governments of France, Germany, and Italy to outlaw tax competition. Im shocked, shocked, by this development.But as one British politician explained, this approach of higher business taxes will further undermine European economic vitality.Now lets shift to our second story, which illustrates the self-serving greed of the political elite at the European Commission.Here are some passages from a story on the spectacular golden parachutes offered to outgoing senior Eurocrats. And well focus on the former President of the European Council since hes such a deserving target of ridicule.Herman Van Rompuy will be entitled to more than 500,000 for doing nothing at the taxpayers expense over the next three years, after finishing his term as president of Europe. After standing down on Monday, the former president of the European Council will be paid 133,723 a year, 55 per cent of his basic salary, until December 2017  to ease him back into life outside the world of Brussels officialdom.Gee, how kind of European taxpayers to ease him back into the real world.Except, of course, Van Rompuys never been in the real world. Hes had his snout in the public trough his entire life.And he also gets to pay far less tax on this money compared to the poor slobs in the private sector who are footing the bill for this official largesse.The transitional allowance does not require Mr Van Rompuy to do any work at all and the cash will be paid under reduced rates of EU community tax, which are far lower than taxation in his native country of Belgium. Mr Van Rompuy has not been a stranger to controversy over the perks of EU officialdom since he took the post in December 2009. He was widely criticised four years ago for using his official motorcade of five limousines as a taxi service to take his family on 325-mile round trip to Paris airport en route to a private holiday in the Caribbean. The cost of Mr Van Rompuys retirement is part of a much larger bill for the handover of the administration in EU as former European Commissioners serving in the last Brussels executive pocket transitional allowances worth around 30million.This scam has been in operation for several years, and keep in mind that excessive pay and lavish perks for commissioners are matched by excessive pay and lavish perks for member of the European Parliament (including taxpayer-financed penile implants).And lavish pay and perks for European Union bureaucrats.And dont forget these are the folks who are pushing for bigger government and higher taxes on a pan-European basis. Like many of our politicians in Washington, they think the private sector is some sort of piata that is capable of producing endless amounts of revenue to finance ever-expanding government.Even though the evidence from Greece, Italy, Spain, etc, confirms that Margaret Thatcher was right when she warned that the problem with big government is thatsooner or later you run out of other peoples money.P.S. European bureaucrats have decided taxpayer-financed tourism is a human right. And they also use taxpayer money to produce self-aggrandizing comic books.P.P.S. The European political elite are so bad that even President Obama has felt compelled to oppose some of their tax initiatives.

A week ago Fed Governor Dudley announced ""U.S. Economic Outlook Looks Brighter"". My response was Ring! Ring! Goes the Bell.Today, Curve Watcher's Anonymous offers a few charts that show the bond market ringing a bell in disbelief of Dudley.Yield Curve as of November 28, 2014Curve AnalysisThe yield curve flattened, then inverted prior to the last recession.The yield curve steepened well ahead of the end of the recession.Since then, the yield curve has steepened twice and flattened twice.What's Next?Starting at the beginning of 2014, short-term yields (2-year and 5-year) have risen while long-term (30-year and 10-year) have declined.In a strengthening economy, yields on the long end of the curve typically rise faster than yields on the short end.Those waiting for the typical recession indicator (an inverted yield curve where short-term bonds yield more than long-term bonds) may as well be waiting for Godot with the Fed holding 3-month rates near zero percent. Nonetheless, expectations of a major Fed tightening cycle are pretty much the norm. If the Fed hikes (which I doubt), then I fully expect to see action similar to the first yield-curve flattening box in the above chart. If the Fed continues to hike, expect a quick inversion.Regardless, the bond market does not believe this happy talk from the economic cheerleaders, and neither do I. 30-Year Yield Minus 5-Year Yield10-Year Yield Minus 5-Year Yield10-Year Yield Minus 2-Year YieldThe first chart shows two incidents since 2010, where declines in yield reversed. However, both occasions ended when the Fed stepped on the gas. If the Fed does so again, will the stock market respond the same way?Feelin' lucky?Mike ""Mish"" Shedlockhttp://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com

Fed Yearns for Higher Inflation to Disguise Asset Bubbles 
Peter Schiff | Dec 04, 2014

Recent statements by Federal Reserve officials would lead just about anyone to believe that one of the bank's central missions has always been to guard against the lurking threat of deflation. They warn that since official inflation has remained below the Fed's 2 percent target for almost two years, the country is liable to fall into a stagnant morass unless the Fed acts boldly to hit its target. It may surprise many that this view is strictly a 21st-century development. The fear (some would say paranoia) regarding sub-2 percent inflation was nowhere in evidence in the past, even when inflation was lower than it is today.  The average headline inflation index (which includes food and energy) in the United States has increased about 1.5 percent since 2013 (this is tabulated based on the many changes in the Consumer Price Index over the past 20 years that have tended to produce lower inflation statistics). In the 70 years since the end of World War II, there was only one similar period, the seven-year stretch from 1959 to 1965 when headline inflation averaged a skimpy 1.26 percent. Contemporary economists would surely assume that during that time the Fed would have broken out the big guns to push inflation back up over 2 percent. In fact, the opposite was true.   In 1961, when inflation came in at just 1.07 percent, Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin (who was hardly considered hawkish at the time) began a campaign of consistent rate hikes that lasted five full years, from an average of 1.96 percent in 1961 to 5.1 percent for all of 1966. He continued the hikes even though inflation didn't move above 1.5 percent, and unemployment didn't fall below 5 percent, until 1965. The biggest increase in the cycle came in 1962 when the Fed jacked rates by 75 basis points (during a year when inflation was below 1.2 percent). Incredibly, Martin and the Fed did this at a time when unemployment (which averaged 6.15 percent in 1961 and 1962) was 36 percent higher than it had been during the prior 10 years (averaging 4.5 percent from 1951 to 1960). To use a 21st-century response, modern economists would say, ""What's up with that?""   One can only imagine what Ben S. Bernanke or Janet Yellen would have done in 1962. During the two-year period of 1961 and 1962, the average unemployment rate was about what it is today. Back then, though, the Fed funds rate was about 120 basis points above inflation (today it is more than 140 basis points below the rate of inflation). Rates above inflation are thought to retard growth, while negative rates are thought to stimulate. Could anyone doubt, based on the policies over the past decade, that Mr. Bernanke or Ms. Yellen would have immediately dropped rates to zero and unleashed quantitative easing? To use another modern rejoinder, it would have been a ""no brainer.""   However, Martin went in the exact opposite direction. The Paul Krugmans of the world would have predicted that raising rates in the face of persistent disinflation and high unemployment would have driven the economy into recession. But guess what? That's exactly what didn't happen.   Gross domestic product in 1962 came in at 6.1 percent over the full year, more than 3 percentage points above the 1961 rate. Real GDP growth in the five-year period from 1962 to 1966 (when the Fed raised rates every year) averaged 5.9 percent (and never fell below 4.4 percent), one of the best streaks in modern memory. In 1965 and 1966, Fed funds averaged 230 basis points above the rate of inflation, and still real GDP came in at an average of 6.5 percent. The difference between the economy then and now could not be any more dramatic. These are not just numbers from another era; they are numbers from another planet. What explains the difference?   Back in the 20th century, the Fed did not consider inflation below 2 percent to be a problem, because it wasn't. The truth is that when it comes to inflation, the lower the better, no matter how low that rate is. Back in the early '60s, the Fed was worried that if it did not act preemptively to contain inflation, that it would accelerate, maybe even rise above 2 percent, which would be a real threat to economic growth. That was because at the time the economy was strong and the stock market was booming. Today, most economists believe the economy is also strong, and the stock market gains over the past five years have been far larger than those that concerned Martin. But he wanted to take away the punch bowl before the party got too rowdy. The new breed of banker seems never to want anyone to sober up.   If low inflation was not a problem for the economy in the early 1960s, why does it represent such an existential threat today? The answer is that it doesn't. Low inflation, or even deflation, is not a threat to the economy but to the asset bubbles that the Fed has inflated in order to create the illusion of economic growth. Without the Fed creating inflation, the bubbles will burst and the government will be forced to deal with its insolvency.   Given that Wall Street economists have a vested interest in downplaying concerns about asset bubbles, it is understandable that the big financial firms have failed to point out the Fed's historic response to low inflation. It is somewhat more troubling to see how the media have completely ignored the past in passing judgment on how the Fed should act today.

Jeb Bush is visiting South Carolina this month and now hes reportedly ""putting out feelers in the first-in-the-nation primary state. Question: Whens he heading to Iowa? 
Real Clear Politics has the exclusive: 
Two top New Hampshire Republican strategists have been contacted this week by a Jeb Bush confidant to discuss their interest in leading the former Florida governors prospective presidential campaign there, RealClearPolitics has learned from GOP sources in the Granite State.
The new outreach from Bushs camp was directed at a pair of experienced and well-respected New Hampshire GOP operatives, each of whom has previously helmed presidential campaigns in the state. 
Both were given the proverbial instruction to keep your powder dry, suggesting that Bush is leaning toward entering the race early next year. 
I think the decisions been made, personally, said one of the strategists who was contacted by Bushs camp and who spoke to RCP under the condition of anonymity. 

 
I suspect Bushs path to the nomination would be not unlike Mitt Romneys in 2012. Of course, Romney had the added benefit of winning the Iowa caucuses (turns out he actually didnt, of course) which in turn gave him a great deal of momentum heading into New Hampshire. Nevertheless, with scores of tea partiers presumably slugging it out in the Hawkeye State, theres little room for a squishy moderate like Bush to successfully swoop in and steal victory. In other words, hell need to win New Hampshire outright to have any sort of chance of continuing his candidacy past the early primary states. 

Obviously, the GOP establishment is looking for a credible, compelling candidate to fill (ahem) Mitt Romneys presumed absence. Is Jeb the guy? Wall Street is reportedly itching for him to run, as is (almost) the entire Bush dynasty. His supporters, it seems, are numerous and growing,  and thus the only question left is will he give into their pleas? 
Judging by what you've just read, my friends, perhaps he already has.

First came thisfrank and stunning analysis fromChuck Schumer, an evidently disgruntled member of Senate Democrats' leadership team.  Now Iowa's Tom Harkin -- one of theignominious 60 'yes' votes for Obamacarewhowill be replaced by conservative Republican Joni Ernst in January --weighs in:

He wonders in hindsight whether the law was made overly complicated to satisfy the political concerns of a few Democratic centrists who have since left Congress.

We had the power to do it in a way that would have simplified healthcare, made it more efficient and made it less costly and we didnt do it, Harkin told The Hill. So I look back and say we should have either done it the correct way or not done anything at all.

What we did is we muddle through and we got a system that is complex, convoluted, needs probably some corrections and still rewards the insurance companies extensively, he added. 

Harkin says in retrospect the Democratic-controlled Senate and House should have enacted a single-payer healthcare system or a public option to give the uninsured access to government-run health plans that compete with private insurance companies.

We had the votes in 09. We had a huge majority in the House, we had 60 votes in the Senate, he said.



Harkin regrets that Congressional Democrats didn't go for thegold and place the entire American healthcare system under complete government control. Because the feds have done such a bang-up job with government owned-and-operated healthcare systems forour veterans andNative Americans. And they've been terrific at keeping other massive single-payer-style systemssolvent and sustainable. Politically speaking,Harkin is delusional if he thinks Democrats, even with their huge majorities, could have imposed fully nationalized healthcare backin 2010. Harry Reid barely corralled the requisite 60 votes for Obamacare, and he needed to employ tawdrybuy-offs andbargains to get there. Nancy Pelosi barely overcamedozens of defections on Obamacare as it waswritten;she did not have the votes for a system-destroying ""public option,"" let alone the full enchilada. Nevertheless, this is the second Senate Democrat to openly admit that the president's signature law was a political mistake and isn't working. One wonders how folks like Ben Nelson, Blanche Lincoln, Mark Pryor, Kay Hagan, Mark Begich, Mark Udall and others must feel. They stuck their necks out for Team Obama, then got mowed down by irate voters, with Obamacare front and center. It's one thing to fall on your legislative sword for a controversial but needed and successful law. Instead, they parroted party lies about legislation that remains aswidely unpopular as ever, and isactively hurting significantly more people than it's helping. Bravo, guys. Thomas Edsall wondersin the New York Timesif Obamacare is ""destroying the Democratic Party."" He reviews in glorious detail the furious recriminations Schumer's assessment provoked by Obamacare's true believers, then looks ahead to future complications:

Of the 60 Democratic senators who voted for Obamacare in 2010, 28 are no longer in office. Of course, not all of the retirements and defeats can be attributed to the advent of Obamacare, but the numbers are striking. The electoral scorecard suggests that Schumer may have less opposition than anticipated to his bid to shift the central concern of the party to more overtly economic issues.

Insofar as Democrats try to reduce hostility to Obamacare, they face two problems. The first is a Republican Party unwilling to support any legislation making the A.C.A. more palatable. The other is the danger that tinkering with any of the provisions that have provoked the strongest opposition could eviscerate the legislation.As if Democrats do not already have enough trouble, data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows that many, if not most, of the seven million people who purchased insurance through the A.C.A. will either have to pay higher premiums or higher deductibles, or submit themselves to the complex process of switching plans.

Barring a stunning upset, that first number will grow to 29 on Saturday, whenMary Landrieu loses her re-election bidin Louisiana. That last bolded bit underscores the problem Democrats face. Coming attractions include more plan cancellations, higher premiums, rising costs, access shock -- and upheaval among the consumers who've supposedly been ""helped"" by the law. Kathleen Sebelius is taking a page from Jon Gruber'ssneering arrogance playbook, explaining away Obamacare's unpopularity as a product ofAmericans' economic illiteracy. The truth is just the opposite. She and her colleagues madespecific promises about the impact and outcomes the public should expect from the new law. They got all of the big stuff wrong, often on purpose. People actually aren't the idiots Democrats take them to be. They can easilyunderstand when their premiums jump. They can see their fatterdeductibles. They can read cancellation notices. They get angry when they can't keep their preferred plans and doctors, as promised. They can feel when access to care tightens up. Sebeliuswent on tojoke that purchasing coverage through Healthcare.gov was akin to reserving airline tickets by fax -- and it's true that Healthcare.gov's failure was catastrophic and embarrassing (Harkin and other dyed-in-the-wool Leftists see the utter collapse of Obamacare's rollout and the horribleVA scandal, and are onlyconvinced that the government needs more power and control). But the core problem with Obamacareis the law itself, not its delivery method. And the pack of lies on which it was built only compounds its defenders' credibility problem.

There are some things that legitimately have two or more sides. Theyre generally opinions, not disputes over the facts.  Should the Kansas City Royals have sent Alex Gordon in the bottom of the 9th inning with two out in game 7 of the World Series? I think yes, absolutely. But many people I know think holding him was the right movethat he wouldve been out easily. Since he was held, we will never know what could have been.  Thats fairly common in most instances when there are areas of ambiguity. Two people can have differing opinions over whether a day is a hot day or a nice day, but there is no dispute over that it is, in fact, a day.   At least thats how it used to work.  Now, thanks to progressive journalists and activists, basic, irrefutable facts no longer have meaning. And a large swath of the American people willingly soak up the ignorance. Lies become some peoples reality.  Michael Brown is dead. He was shot and killed by Officer Darren Wilson. Those basic facts are all that everyone involved in the sloppy mess in Ferguson, Mo., agree on. But there are many more facts in that case, indisputable facts, about which people lie, and gleefully so.  Michael Brown did not put his hands up to surrender and was not shot in the back. Yet those knowing untruths, those lies, are repeated by progressives daily. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus took to the floor of the House of Representatives this week to bring attention to this lie, to spread it further.   The CBC members are either ignorant of the forensic evidence and the eyewitness testimony that proves that did not happen, or they are counting on their audience to be. Neither is particularly good, but the latter is particularly bad because it is the truth.   The people who believe the Hands up, dont shoot! lie are not interested in facts or reality, they want Darren Wilson to be a racist who woke up that morning wanting to kill someone. They need George Zimmerman to be white and have hunted down Trayvon Martin.   And they desire more black lives to be ended by white people so they can keep the ignorant marinating in their clueless bliss.  Attorney General Eric Holder famously said that, when it comes to discussing issues of race in America, the United States is a nation of cowards. That, like much of what Holder says, is a lie. No one is afraid to have a conversation about race, but an honest one is impossible when one side isnt willing to stick to reality in that discussion.   Remember that book Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus?  At least those were both planets. On the issue of race, normal people are, well, people, and progressives are a nebula.   The worst part of all of this is not that progressive activists, journalists and politicians liemost people in those professions lie, progressive or not. Its that people believe it.  The facts are readily available to anyone actually interested in them. Too many arent interested.   There are more people knowingly lying about police hunting black men, but there are many who buy it. They also buy the lie that the system is rigged against them, a lie often repeated by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.   But just because people lie to you and count on your being ignorant doesnt mean you have to believe that lie or remain ignorant. Those are choices. Choices made by adults who have other options.  Statistics show that areas that are heavily minority are also economically depressed. They are also fiercely loyal Democratic Party voters. They put progressives in office who promise the world and deliver nothing but misery. Then they re-elect them, repeatedly, not because theyre improving anything, but because they believe the lie that things would be worse if they voted for someone else. Its difficult to care for someone who continually bangs their head against a wall and complains of a headache.   An honest discussion of race involves an admission that this country, thanks to southern Democrats and early 20th century progressives, has had a horrible record when it comes to treating minorities fairly. But it also would include an acceptance of the fact that those days, with rare exception, are long gone. That the problems of the black community are, in large part, a result of the actions of leaders elected by that same community.   No one but Michael Brown caused Michael Brown to attack Darren Wilson, try to take his gun and charge at him. Just like no one made 70 percent of black babies be born out of wedlock except the two people who went to bed together. Pregnancy is as easy to avoid as being hit by a train, and out-of-wedlock births are the fastest way to live a life stuck in poverty. None of this is hidden. None is secret. Yet millions of people of all races each year stupidly make that choice, none at a higher rate than in the black community.   Forget the discussion of how race affects America. We need a discussion of how progressive reinforced stupidity affects America. Get rid of that and the issue of race fades away, because its not really about race at all, its about progressive manipulation.   Marcia Fudge, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, on the House floor Monday called the Grand Jurys refusal to indict Officer Wilson a painful reminderthat law enforcement officers kill our black and brown men and boys without repercussions.   Fudge represents parts of Cleveland. Cleveland has seen 58 homicides through the first half of this year, up from 50 through the same time in 2013. How many of those bodies did she have to metaphorically have to step over to get to the floor to make that false claim about an incident nearly 600 miles away? The answer is simple, and the same for every CBC member who did the same thing  as many as it took.  Life is about priorities, and the progressives priorities are only the lives they can use to entrench their power.

Helping a Millennial Get a Job

Considering how awful a job can be, it's difficult to imagine that so many young people are out there actually looking for work. Seems to me it would be so much easier to be born with a trust fund. Even more surprising -- apparently, many of the boys and girls who are putting their young lives -- and their young resumes -- on the line, are not being snapped up. It's a depressing situation, but there is hope. Doug Mitchell, CEO of Argenta Field Solutions in Corpus Christi, Texas, has come to the aid of millennial job seekers with ""Five Tips on Mastering Job Interviews.""Why Mr. Mitchell aims his tips only to millennials is a mystery, since there definitely are some young people who have found work. [I don't know how a 14-year old can graduate medical school, but that's who appears to have replaced my doctor, when he retired.] Since millennials don't like to read, I've produced a Snapchat-worthy precis of this excellent advice, which you can Tweet to any millenials who may be stalking you and your job. Tip No. 1 is ""The Basics,"" like knowing ""Who are you meeting?"" and ""What does the company do?"" For me, these are two items, which are much better not to know. Who cares who you are meeting? A job interview is all about you, Mr. or Ms. Millennial, not some doofus so low on the corporate totem pole that he or she is given the demeaning assignment of doing introductory job interviews. As an entitled millennial, your basic goal is to leap-frog this cipher, whoever they may be, and get in front of someone who can make a decision, like the big boss' Pilates teacher, or the person who stocks the breakroom candy machine. As for knowing what the company does -- this is also not essential information. Once they come to their senses and put you in charge, the company's business model is going to change, radically. Explain to the interview droid that while building cars, or toasters, or software, may seem like a viable business to the ancient ones who run the company now, you plan to move the business into high-growth areas that appeal to millennials like yourself. You're talking authentic products, like artisanal condiments, and artisanal beer, and artisanal soap carved in the image of Lena Dunham. (If the brilliance of your ideas is not immediately embraced, walk out. Just be sure to get the address of the company, which presumably you also do not know, since you will need it for your artisanal GPS to guide you back to your dorm room.)In Tip No. 2, Mr. Mitchell writes, ""You hear about a company's mission statement, but what about YOUR mission statement?""Exactly! Ignore the misguided obsession about the bogus needs of the employer, and focus 110 percent on the critical concerns of the job candidate. The areas Mitchell wants millenials to cover in their mission statement include ""what you are"" and ""what you're about?""I'd suggest, ""what you are"" is someone who is sick and tired of being grilled like a halibut by an out-of-touch, out-of-luck, out-of-time loser and ""what you're about"" is a big fat salary from a job where you get to boss people around.Tip No. 3 is about weaknesses and strengths, which I find very insulting, since any millennial with a Barista degree from Harvard clearly has zero weaknesses. If some teeny-weeny tiny weakness does exist, I humbly suggest using the classic technique ""to highlight what you can do for the company."" Explain that by hiring you, everyone else in the company will look really good by comparison. Tip No. 4 has to do with the millennial convincing the interviewer that they will ""create that spark that tells them you're on the team."" If ""spark"" is defined by surly behavior and constant demands for attention, this should be no problem. Lastly, Tip No. 5 revolves around telling the potential employer ""where you want to be in 90 days and a year from the hire date."" I'd recommend honesty here. In 90 days, you want to be in the Cayman Islands, with the money you've looted from the company treasury, and in a year, Venezuela, where young people are appreciated, and there is no extradition treaty. Will following these tips get a millennial hired? I highly doubt it, and how wonderful that will be. With no annoying young people around, old fogies like thee and me may actually be able to keep our jobs!

Now that the Ferguson grand jury documents have been made public, even MSNBC has had to quietly drop its fantasy of Michael Brown being gunned down like a dog in the street by Officer Darren Wilson. Instead, MSNBC is defending the looters.   On Monday night, MSNBC's Chris Hayes objected to anyone referring to the people who ""set fires or looted as 'thugs.'""   His guest, former Seattle chief of police Norm Stamper, said, ""I could not agree more."" (Stamper did such a bang-up job dealing with the World Trade Organization riots in 1999 that he was forced to resign -- which may explain why he is the left's favorite police chief.)   Hardworking black people in Ferguson poured their lives into their stores, depended on them to support their families and shopped at them to improve their quality of life. I wonder if they appreciated Hayes' principled opposition to calling the arsonists ""thugs.""   Instead of exquisite sensitivity to the feelings of black thugs, how about considering the feelings of black citizens who want to live in safe neighborhoods?   There's a reason so many black people supported Officer Wilson's account and that a black woman walked into a burning convenience store in the middle of the riot to extinguish the fire with gallons of milk.   In ""Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama,"" I told the true stories of dozens of allegedly racist crimes sensationalized by the media. In almost all of them, there were unheralded black heroes who stood up for law and order against ""the community.""   When Exeter student Edmund Perry got himself killed by mugging a cop, at least a half-dozen black witnesses supported the cop's version. While The New York Times was droning on about Perry as ""a prized symbol of hope,"" Perry's black neighbors were testifying to the grand jury that his brother admitted they had mugged a cop.   At least three black friends of the Central Park rapists told the police that the defendants had confessed to attacking the jogger. (In what must have been an oversight, those witnesses didn't make it into Ken Burns' movie.) A young black woman, who was in Bernie Goetz's subway car with her husband and child when Goetz shot four black muggers, told the jury, ""Those punks got what they deserved.""   Goetz's lawyer Barry Slotnick made no effort to keep blacks off the jury. His faith was rewarded: Goetz's biggest defender on the jury was a black bus driver from Harlem. It is well known by prosecutors that working and married blacks make great jurors.   But we never hear about those black people. Why, that would spoil everything!   There are loads of movies about black criminals -- rewritten the way the media were hoping the story would come out, but didn't. (Movie: ""Murder Without Motive: The Edmund Perry Story."" Spoiler alert! The tale of a racist white cop who shot an innocent black honor student for no discernible reason.)   How about a movie paying tribute to the African-American eyewitnesses in Ferguson who told the truth to the grand jury?   Who speaks for them?   It's sure not Sen. Rand Paul.   We need video footage of blacks burning other blacks' stores down juxtaposed with clips of Sen. Paul saying that the reason ""three out of four people in prison are black or brown"" may be ""because of the color of their skin or their economic status."" Another possibility -- I'm just throwing it out there -- is that the reason black, brown or white people are in prison is because they've committed crimes.   Improving their ""economic status"" doesn't seem to help. The two men arrested for trying to buy bombs in Ferguson in order to blow up the Gateway Arch and kill the prosecutor and chief of police were prevented from buying as many bombs as they had hoped because they needed to wait for more money to be transferred onto a girlfriend's EBT card (Electronic Benefits Card -- food stamps).   For claiming the drug laws are racist, Sen. Paul seems to imagine his portrait is being hung in black homes across America, between pictures of Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy. ""White people do drugs too,"" Paul tells admiring white liberals in the media, ""but either they don't get caught or they have better attorneys or they don't live in poverty.""   If Rand Paul thinks black people are rooting for black crack dealers to go free, he's even crazier than his old man.   It was African-Americans, exploding in rage at the devastation crack was inflicting on their neighborhoods in the 1980s, who demanded severe penalties for crack cocaine. In a typical news story from 1986, Julius Lee, the black city commissioner in Fort Pierce, Florida, said, ""Drugs are terrible things, but these cocaine rocks are the terriblest of the terrible."" Black grocer Eugene Gibson sadly remarked, while sweeping the sidewalk in front of his store, ""We're in a world of trouble here. ... It's these cocaine rocks.""   A few years later, in 1989, black columnist Dorothy Gaiter perfectly expressed the feelings of the (non-crack dealing) black community in The Miami Herald: ""Crack sellers should be locked up and their bounty taken away from them. The jails are crowded with murderers and others who deserve to be there, but the crack seller is a murderer too. He's a lethal seducer of our young, a destroyer of our neighborhoods. Being poor is no crime and should not result in a sentence to live among the lawless.""   But now Sen. Paul is pushing the idea that the drug laws black people begged for were actually part of a racist plot to lock up African-Americans. It's like something out of Maxine Waters' dream journal.  The only people impressed with Rand Paul's defense of black criminals are the ones who will never be victimized by them.

Who Killed Black Friday?
Peter Morici | Dec 04, 2014

Black Friday weekend is just not what it used to be.  Despite falling gas prices, stock prices posting records, and buoyant consumer confidence, Thanksgiving weekend salesin stores and on-linewere down about 11 percent from last year.  Five forces combined to reduce this years spending bingeand most will endure in the years ahead.  1. Black Friday Isnt So Special Anymore  Years ago, retailers attracted shoppers to malls the day after Thanksgiving by offering limited supply door openersone-day deep discounts. These days more stores open on Thanksgiving Day, offer equally good deals the days before and after Black Friday, and keep cutting prices to clear out inventory before Christmas rather than hold back for January sales.  Black Friday simply isnt special anymore, unless a shopper is scooping up that deeply discounted home theater whose availability may disappear. It may be a great day to get out and have fun with friends, but Black Friday is often not the best day to get the best deal.  2. Middle Class Has Less Money to Spend  For most folks incomes have not kept up with inflation.  Since 2007, median family income is down more than $4000, and the biggest price increases have been for items most folks deem necessitiesfood and rent, health care, and internet and cellular phone service.  To accommodate, middle class families are spending less on apparel, furniture and appliances, and meals in restaurants.  Americans may still be purchasing items for everyone on their holiday list but are forced by limited budgets to buy less expensive itemsunless they borrow.  3. Americans Are More Cautious about Debt  Americans once viewed what they could afford by the money in their pockets and bank accounts, but after World War II that increasingly changed to include what they could borrow on credit cards and with second mortgages.  Hardships in the wake of the financial crisis have changed habits. Americans still borrow for cars and college but are more reluctant to buy other items on time payments.  For retailers, Black Friday was all about getting folks into the stores with hot door openers and then inspiring impulse purchasing but the new caution about credit cards puts a real damper on that strategy.  4. Lower Gas Prices  Gas prices have fallen, freeing up lots of income, one would think, for Black Friday binges. However, many Americans took the extra cash to the new car showroom, where sales of larger vehicles like the GM Sierra and Chrysler Ram rocketed.  New car buyers will be putting the savings from lower gas prices into car payments, and to some extent, back into their gas tanks by shifting to less fuel efficient vehicles.  5. Cultural Change  Growing up in New York and near some of the nations busiest shopping malls, Thanksgiving was for my dad and unclesfootball from morning into the nightand Black Friday was for my mom and aunts.  These days women are more career oriented, and while they still like to shop (and so do the men for electronic toys we didnt have in the 1960s), it is simply less the iconic holiday it once was.  Black Fridayand Cyber Mondayare now about getting good deals, and retailers have increasingly made the days around Thanksgiving less attractive by the even better deals yet to come. Americansliving on more constrained budgets and scarred by the financial crisisare more inclined to wait until the days just prior to Christmas  Just as baseball once reigned supreme, only to be replaced by college basketball and pro football, a new sensibility is reducing Black Friday weekend to the status of only a major holidaynot the day of days in Americas consumer culture.

Diplomacy Failed in Iran: Fund Missile Defense

The US and several other nations have been in talks in hopes of negotiating with Iran to stop its nuclear program in exchange for lifting the UN sanctions. But those negotiations have gone no-where. On Monday, the deadline came and went without an agreement.Extending the deadline to permit more talks will not likely protect a single person. It just gives Iran more time to develop a bomb. Why would Iran agree to limit itself when obtaining the bomb will allow it to threaten its way out of sanctions? Even if Iran were to agree to something, there is virtually no chance that the Mullahcracy will keep its promise when they are so close to obtaining the bomb they clearly covet.Hopefully Congress is paying attention. During the lame duck session, both the House and the Senate need to quickly fund Patriot modernization. This would send a powerful message to the dictators who rule Iran. It would also send a powerful message to our allies  four of whom in the Middle East use the Patriot system and share in its costs. But even more important than sending messages, the Patriot system has a proven track record of protecting against rogue missiles. This is a powerful response to Irans maniacal drive to obtain the bomb. While the world talks and negotiates over Irans nuclear program, they continue to race towards a nuclear capability and continue to develop missiles that threaten our allies and troops in the Middle East. If Congress funds Patriot modernization, it would be taking concrete steps to counter Iran and at the same time make sure a proven system is modernized and upgraded to continue its strong record of defense and preventing missile attacks. The Patriot Missile is highly mobile and can be used to protect our soldiers as well as civilians from enemy missile fire. So it can be brought in wherever the risks become hot. The public first saw the Patriot in action years ago when it was used to shoot SCUD missiles out of the sky during the first Gulf War. The system has been upgraded over the years and has proven very capable in protecting defined areas from missile attack. Military planners have asked for a new round of upgrades to Patriot to keep it ahead of the curve in fighting new and developing threats. This is why Congress needs to act quickly. The Patriot missile is used by four of our allies in the Middle East  the very people who will be most proximately threatened by Irans nuclear program and its missile program. Seven other allies around the globe also use the Patriot system. These allies are watching to see if we will continue to invest in upgrading the Patriot system for the next generation of threats. If we invest, they will too and thus share in the costs. This means that we don have to pay the full bill for its continued development and upgrades. We will have 11 partners. Irans progress towards not only a nuclear bomb, but also an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) that can deliver this weapon, illustrate the growing threats to the American homeland. That is why we must make an investment in Ground-based Midcourse defense, the only system currently in place to defend the American homeland from a missile attack. There was a time when we were told that relations with Russia had been reset. Now we are confronted with a diametrically opposed reality. Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a massive nuclear moderation program and successfully tested a new ICBM. Putin has even threatened nuclear retaliation. Being more flexible with Putin has profited us nothing.North Korea has developed nuclear-capable ballistic missiles with a range of up to 6,200 miles. That means they can strike Alaska, Hawaii and parts of the western United States. China is engaged in a huge military build up and is developing submarines and high tech missiles so that it can increase its footprint and power globally.In the next five years, the Missile Defense Agency estimates that the number of hostile missiles will increase from 6,300 currently to more than 8,000. And it wont simply be more missiles. These missiles will be better and more capable  going farther, faster, more accurately, and carrying larger payloads, and having more evasive properties. This is why we must continue to develop and deploy a robust, multilayered missile defense system  one that also includes GMD.The world is becoming more dangerous and we face greater risks. We can either ignore them and later pay a terrible price. Or we can prepare and prevent the realization of those awful and costly risks. We simply cannot afford to slow walk our preparations for these risks. Thus, Congress must immediately fund Patriot modernization and properly fund other missile defense programs that provide a secure layered defense against missile attack.

If real estate mogul and deep-pocketed White House donor Terry Bean were a Republican, he'd be a household name by now.Bean's face would be splashed all over the covers of grocery-stand newsweeklies. The garrulous hostesses of ABC's ""The View"" would be haranguing the GOP to return his campaign contributions. Child-welfare advocates would be demanding his resignation from top political advocacy and civic groups.Media satellite trucks from NBC's ""Today"" show would be parked outside the Lane County, Ore., Circuit Court on Dec. 3 for his first appearance.And The New York Times archives would be teeming with thousand-word editorials and multiple lead stories about his grand jury indictment on horrifying sexual abuse allegations involving multiple victims -- including a 15-year-old boy.Instead, a search for ""Terry Bean"" on the left-wing paper of record's website on Tuesday yielded exactly one story dated Jan. 16, 1880, about a Westchester County, N.Y., elder with that name -- plus a sponsored advertising link to retailer L.L. Bean.So, who is Terry Bean? He's a wealthy, high-flying liberal and celebrated gay-rights activist who co-founded the influential Human Rights Campaign organization. He is also a veteran member of the board of the HRC Foundation, which disseminates Common Core-aligned ""anti-bullying"" material to children's schools nationwide.Bean shelled out more than $500,000 for President Obama and the Democrats in 2012. He was rewarded with an exclusive Air Force One ride with Obama. The president also gave the developer a special shout-out at an opulent fundraiser in Portland, where Bean's family had established a longstanding political and corporate fiefdom. Bean gleefully rubbed elbows with first lady Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton -- and made sure everyone on his Flickr photo-sharing site knew it. A relentless schmoozer, the campaign finance bundler introduced the commander in chief to his 25-year-old ex-boyfriend, Kiah Lawson. The pair posed for a cozy snapshot beneath an august portrait of George Washington in the White House library in 2013.Late last month, however, the former lovebirds posed for a seedier set of pics: their creepy mug shots at the Multnomah County, Ore., Detention Center. After a sweeping investigation led by the Portland police department's sex crime units and two county district attorney's offices, authorities charged Bean with two felony counts of third-degree sodomy and one misdemeanor count of third-degree sex abuse. Lawson was indicted on third-degree sodomy and third-degree sexual abuse.Allegations of Bean's lurid sexual trysts with young men, which Lawson says the Democratic donor secretly videotaped, first surfaced in the local Willamette Week newspaper in June. Police say the pair enticed a 15-year-old boy to a hotel in Eugene, Ore., after meeting him through the iPhone app Grinder, which helps men locate ""local gay, bi and curious guys for dating.''Consider this: Harry Reid has taken to the Senate floor to repeatedly demonize GOP donors and upstanding businessmen Charles and David Koch for exercising their First Amendment rights. Hollywood celebrities Alec Baldwin, Kathleen Turner, Jason Alexander and Stephen Colbert have all targeted conservative Citizens United for its historic role in protecting political free speech. All are mute on a powerful Democratic donor actually accused of heinous sexual abuse crimes against a child.While The New York Times has spilled gallons of ink on the campus rape epidemic, the GOP's Mark Foley underage page scandal and the Catholic Church's pedophilia problem, it has remained silent the past six months on the alleged child rape scheme of one of the Democratic Party's most prominent campaign contributors and activists.On Tuesday, the paper saw fit to run a 652-word A-section story on an obscure GOP aide who was forced to quit her job after criticizing Obama's daughters on her Facebook page.Nothing on Terry Bean.

Something Weird in the U.S. New Home Market
Political  Calculations | Dec 04, 2014













Share on Facebook













 SHARES




















Something really weird appears to have happened to the U.S. new home market in October 2014.Here, if we're to believe the preliminary figures reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, both the median sale price and the average sale price of new homes in the United States posted their largest ever recorded month-over-month gains in October 2014.In September 2014, the median sale price of a new home in the U.S. was originally reported to be $259,000, which was just revised slightly upward by $2,700 to $261,700. The U.S. Census Bureau then indicates that the median sale price for a new home for October 2014 is $305,000, an all time record month-over-month increase of 16.7%. By contrast, the three next highest month-over-month percentage increases in the median sale prices of new homes in the U.S. were 10.7% in May 2010, 10.6% in April 1966 and 10.5% in October 2006.Meanwhile, in September 2014, the average sale price of a new home in the U.S. was originally reported to be $313,200, which was just revised slightly upward by $1,000 to $314,200. The U.S. Census Bureau then indicates that the average sale price for a new home for October 2014 is $401,100, an all time record month-over-month increase of 27.7%. The chart below, which shows the recorded median and average sale prices of all new homes sold in the U.S. since January 1975 illustrates just how out of place these prices are with respect to all the prices that have been recorded before.At the same time, the Census Bureau indicates that a seasonally-adjusted number of 455,000 new homes were sold in the United States in September 2014, with a preliminary figure of 458,000 new homes being bought in October 2014, an increase of just 3,000.For all these numbers to work together, it would mean that after Americans snapped up 455,000 new homes in the U.S. during September 2014, other Americans suddenly rushed out to buy 458,000 more new homes just as they were in the process of recording their largest ever month over month increase in modern history. And that modern history includes the U.S. housing bubble!Folks, either some or all of these numbers are simply wrong or there's something really weird going on in the U.S.' new home market. And that something weird would be the sudden evaporation of the affordable portion of the new home market.That change in the sales mix of the U.S. new home market would confirm that it is not just become skewed, but has become exceptionally distorted. And that change would not be a positive development.Data SourcesU.S. Census Bureau. Median and Average Sales Prices of New Homes Sold in the United States. [Excel Spreadsheet].

Pelosi Plans Defeat of Member-Elect Bruce Poliquin...Before He's Even Sworn In

Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is already planning the takedown of member-elect Bruce Poliquin (R-ME)...before he's even sworn in. Democrat Emily Cain, who lost to Poliquin by five points in November, is reportedly already being vetted for her second attempt at capturing Maine's 2nd congressional district.
Former Maine state Sen. Emily Cain is on Capitol Hill this week being recruited by House leadership to run again in 2016.
According to a Democratic source, Cain is meeting Wednesday and Thursday with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujn to discuss a potential rematch with GOP Rep.-elect Bruce Poliquin.
The seat was previously held by Mike Michaud, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the governor's mansion.
While I understand that the Democrats must be in panic mode following the GOP beatdown on Election Day, it just seems startlingly early to already be preening a candidate for 2016. A lot can change in two years. The election was literally a month ago.
Personally, I hope Cain runs again...and loses again.

Alas it is over. I am speaking of the Thanksgiving Day celebration -- one of my favorite holidays. It is a serious celebration as we give thanks for our many blessings. Yet it is also a jolly day, full of good food, drink and sport -- perhaps touch football, more likely a televised game. The whole family comes together and, often in the company of friends, has a festive time. Moreover, there is a venerable sense of tradition to the feast that renders the whole holiday somehow reassuring.However, now comes a time troubled by a deep sense of apprehension, especially for people of faith. I am speaking of the Christmas season. The apprehension begins with how we greet people? Last week it was customary to say, ""Have a Happy Thanksgiving"" or just ""Happy Thanksgiving."" I must have intoned that line a hundred times, never with a premonition of giving offense or of introducing an evangelizing spirit into a brief social encounter. ""Happy Thanksgiving"" might be prefatory to devastating a plump bird, but only the very morbid are offended and they can always munch on a nutrition bar. Now, after Thanksgiving Day, thoughtful people are given to pause. Does one greet another with ""Merry Christmas""? In some parts of the country it is deemed rude, even belligerent. Play it safe and try ""Happy Holidays"" or, maybe, ""Happy Winter."" That last absurdity has been trotted out, admittedly at the fussy suggestion of educators in the Stalinist northeast. Some of the comrades have even created an entire pageant around an imagined winter holiday as opposed to the traditional holiday of Christmas.Thanksgiving causes no such unpleasantness, though I do not know why this should be so. Most of us sitting down to our traditional turkey are offering thanks to God. That has been true ever since President Abraham Lincoln made the last Thursday in November a federal holiday as he put it of ""Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens."" Who do the cavilers think we are offering thanks to, the giant corporations? Wall Street? Big Bird? Well, if we were, that should disturb them as much as a hearty ""Merry Christmas."" You can be sure that the kind of person who objects to ""Merry Christmas"" also usually suffers similar psychological tics about the giant corporations or Wall Street bankers. The same cavilers who have created such a stir over Christmas are usually full of animus about capitalism and other organizing principles of American society.When one considers the enormous lengths to which some people have gone to make Christmas a controversial occasion one has to pause and wonder what the controversy is all about. There are certainly non-believers who take the holiday in stride: Jews, Muslims, atheists, even the ""who-cares"" members of American society. Some of the aforementioned probably even take in elements of Christmastime, for instance, gift-giving, mistletoe and eggnog. I think we get a sense of what the Christmas controversy is about when we look at the reductio ad absurdum of the controversy. That is when we see the cavilers trying to ban the Christmas tree, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and perhaps Frosty. What is so religious about a Christmas tree? The tree may not be religious but it is traditional in America at this time of year, and now we are getting a glimpse of the true animating spirit of Christmas' opponents. They do not much like traditional America. They want to reform it. They want to take down the manifestations of a revered and ancient holiday and replace them with, well, with nothing. What would they put up in the place of the infant in swaddling clothes, choral music and that infernal tree?American leaders and the American people have reason to celebrate Christmas at the end of every year for various reasons, some solemn some trivial. As for the solemn reasons, remember the prayer offered up by the president of the United States as America embarked on the last year of World War II. Though Franklin Roosevelt was not a Republican, I think many Republicans today can share his sentiments when he said on Christmas Eve, 1944: ""It is not easy to say 'Merry Christmas' ... tonight to our armed forces at their battle stations all over the world -- or to our allies who fight by their side. ... [Yet] the Christmas spirit lives tonight in the bitter cold of the front lines in Europe and in the heat of the jungles and the swamps of Burma and the Pacific Islands."" Our soldiers ""know the determination of all right-thinking people and Nations, that Christmases such as those that we have known in these years of world tragedy shall not come again to beset the souls of the children of God. ... We pray that ... God will protect our gallant men and women in the uniforms of the United Nations -- that He will receive into His infinite grace those who make their supreme sacrifice in the cause of righteousness, in the cause of love of Him and His teachings."" So ""Merry Christmas"" my Democratic friends, and Independents, and, certainly, Republicans.

In the wake of President Obamas executive amnesty, some on the Right have quite fervently put forth the suggestion that House Republicans should cancel the State of the Union address as some sort of response, or slap on the wrist, if you will. And its an idea thats gained steam among members of Congressand pundits, alike. But the move would most likely be seen as petty, and one the liberal media would eat up. In the end, it would also accomplish nothing in terms of changing the presidents immigration actions.   Its a good thing, then, that House Speaker John Boehner has rebuffed those pleas.   ""The more the president talks about his ideas, the more unpopular he becomes,"" Boehnersaid on Thursday. ""Why would I want to deprive him of that opportunity?""

Is it relevant that St. Louis, near Ferguson, recently had the third-highest per capita murder rate of any large city (with 250,000 or more residents) in America, ranking behind New Orleans and Detroit? And, according to an analysis of 2011 FBI crime stats, St. Louis had the second-highest overall crime rate among large cities.Is it relevant that the state of Missouri ranks second among states in per capita black homicide victimization rate? According to the Violence Policy Center, only Nebraska has a higher per capita murder rate for black victims, based on 2011 FBI data. Last year, according to FBI statistics, more than 6,300 blacks were homicide victims, or almost 18 per day, almost all at the hands of other blacks. Even more disturbing, a decreasing number of murders are ""cleared"" (solved). In 1961, 93 percent of all homicides were cleared. That number now is down to 64 percent in 2013, primarily because of drug and gang-related murders where people don't talk because of a ""no snitch"" culture or fear of retaliation. Is it relevant that while the world watched the Michael Brown case, two black teenagers and one Hispanic teenager were arrested for murder in a deadly hammer attack against a St. Louis man? As to the Michael Brown/Darren Wilson case, is it relevant that the forensic evidence shows a trail of blood leading away from Officer Wilson's car and then back toward Wilson, corroborating Wilson's version that Brown charged him? Also, several witnesses, including black witnesses, confirmed Wilson's version. One witness described Brown charging toward Wilson in a ""full charge"": ""(Mike Brown) stopped. He did turn, he did some sort of body gesture, I'm not sure what it was, but I know it was a body gesture. And I could say for sure he never put his hands up after he did his body gesture; he ran towards the officer full charge. The officer fired several shots at him, and to give an estimate, I would say roughly around five to six shots was fired at Mike Brown. Mike Brown was still coming towards the officer, and at this point I'm thinking, wow, is this officer missing Mike Brown at this close of a range? Mike Brown continuously came forward in the charging motion, and at some point, at one point he started to slow down and he came to a stop. And when he stopped, that's when the officer ceased fire, and when he ceased fire, Mike Brown started to charge once more at him. When he charged once more, the officer returned fire with, I would say, give an estimate of three to four shots. And that's when Mike Brown finally collapsed.""Yes, several ""pro-Michael Brown"" pundits point to the greater number of witnesses who apparently saw Michael Brown with his hands up. But when witnesses don't agree, with physical evidence that doesn't line up, this isn't even probable cause, let alone reasonable doubt -- if the matter ever reached a jury.Is it relevant to those crying ""injustice"" that the Department of Justice is conducting two investigations, one to determine whether Michael Brown's civil rights were violated and the other a top-down review of the Ferguson Police Department? Or that our top law enforcement officer -- the President of United States -- is black, as is the attorney general, the secretary of the department of Homeland Security and Obama's national security advisor? Or that all of this suggests an extremely thorough investigation, with absolutely nothing swept under the carpet? The media, led by CNN, covers Ferguson as a civil rights story -- rather than focusing on the simple question of whether Officer Wilson responsibly used lethal force. Incredibly, Harvard's Charles Ogletree, once Barack Obama's law professor, called Ferguson ""just like the assassination"" of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Ogletree said: ""This reminds us of exactly what happened years ago when I was a young kid to the great man Emmett Till, the young kid who was killed in Mississippi for allegedly whistling at a white woman. This is even worse, because Michael Brown did not break in any law at all, in terms of the police officer.""Many say Ferguson suffers because its police force ""doesn't look like the city."" Meaning what? That white cops can't police black areas? That when people call 911, they want an officer who ""looks like them""? What do the ""activists"" think Dr. King would say if we assumed cops were bad because of the color of their skin? He'd call it what it is: racially profiling white cops. So much for evaluating people, including police officers, not on the basis of their color -- but on the content of their character.

It was a great session Tuesday; especially as it followed a couple days of anxiety which is like the end of the world these days. The Dow at all-time highs is very misleading, however, lots of stocks are down big from blue chips to small caps, and trillions of dollars continue to sit on the sidelines. Still, the upward bias and upward moves on good news is the right combination for stocks.A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article hit home for a lot of people and dashed all hope that it would take cheaper oil to change the fortunes of Americas middle-class. It was not man bites man stuff for most people, but it does reiterate something we discuss on my show a lot- how people can change their lives. The dynamics of what we spend our money on has changed, so while we have cutback big time on everything from home phones to entertainment, costs on new luxury items like home internet and cellular phones are soaring.The WSJ looks at cost increases from 2007 to 2013, but the big cost increase occurred over the past dozen years and hit what was a moot point, protecting the middle-class.Housing (now rent) +27%College Savings & Tuition +39%Healthcare +90%Child Care +36%This has caused a decrease in retirement savings and that money must be put to work. Yes, it might be asking a lot in an era where everyone expects to have everything, but those that cutback and invest are the ones who will have better lives down the road. It might mean ditching the iPhone and buying Apple stock instead, but at least you are taking control of your own destiny.Big Business Ready for War... Against the AdministrationMembers from the Business Roundtable met with President Obama to air a number of grievances, including frustration and confusion over the administrations lawsuit against Honeywell for enforcing a key plank of the healthcare law.One of the rare bipartisan parts of Obamacare is workplace wellness to reduce smoking, obesity, and hypertension. Honeywell asked employees to take a biometric test to measure areas of health that need improvement and those who refused lost the following:$1,500   From Health Savings Account$500  Medical Plan Surcharge$1,000  Tobacco Surcharge$1,000  Tobacco Surcharge for SpouseThe Honeywell lawsuit broke the dam and now businesses are saying they may not go along quietly with the failed healthcare law. Moreover, businesses are also saying that they foresee a dramatic decline in capital expenditures over the next six-months.ExpectationsOver Next Six MonthsChange Q/QSub-IndexSales-1.3%Cap Ex-5.8%Hiring+3.6%The sad irony is that many business owners say US investment spending could be substantially stronger by fixing two things the federal government controls.US Tax policy and regulatory issues are the twin killers of prosperity and why big business is sitting on its cash.

You wouldn't know it from the way the press is covering the lame duck session of Congress in Washington, but the Democrats still control two of the three levers of legislative power. In spite of the results of the elections exactly one month ago, Harry Reid and his 54 Democratic colleagues still control the Senate. The GOP won't take over until the 114th Congress opens on January 6, 2015. Nevertheless, the breathless reporting out of here would almost make you believe that Republicans have already taken over and anything that isn't done between now and the end of the 113th Congress will have been the GOP's fault. If were one of those 70 incoming Members I might well sidle up to a member of the Leadership in my chamber and of my party and say something like: ""I was just elected by running on a number of these bills you guys are trying to hustle to the floor. I am not happy at the prospect of having a bunch of these issues decided by the very people we have just hammered into retirement."" There are a couple of things that must - or should - be worked on between now and the end of the year. First and foremost is keeping the government open. You will remember that the only reason the GOP is still a living, breathing organism in Our Nation's Capital, is because when the government shut down in October 2013, it was immediately followed by the total collapse of the Obamacare website and the spotlight shone on that failure for months. The current planning appears to be to pass a bill paying for everything except the Department of Homeland Security through the end of the fiscal year, September 30, 2015. DHS funding will only go through mid-February (more-or-less). Why? Because DHS is where the border patrol and similar agencies live and the anti-immigration legislation wing of the House GOP wants a separate vote on them to make even clearer how far President Obama overstepped his authority by changing the existing law by Executive Order. The House, earlier this week, voted overwhelmingly in favor of short-term ""tax extenders"" that will be in effect until the end of this calendar year. The vote in the House was 378-46. The term ""tax extenders"" is classic Washington Double-Speak. The bill does not extend taxes. The bill extends tax breaks in favor of things like business deductions for research and development. It also includes, according to Politico.com ""tax breaks for individuals including a deduction for mortgage debt forgiveness, a break for state and local sales taxes paid as well as breaks for teachers and commuters."" That's the House version. The Senate is taking up a bill that also includes tax breaks for laid-off workers and, a favorite of Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore) a tax break for the ""purchase of electric motorcycles."" And here you thought the Democrats in the Senate weren't paying proper attention to the big problems. Electric motorcycles. Imagine Marlon Brando on one of those babies. The best part of the tax bill negotiations is that it exposed another (as we described it early this week) a Crack in the Dems. Seems that the House and Senate were on the cusp of working out a deal to have these tax breaks run through the end of 2015, instead of the end of 2014 (three weeks away). Without consulting Harry Reid - the senior Democrat in the Senate, remember - the White House made it clear it would veto such a bill. National Journal pronounced that ""another humiliation"" for Reid at the hands of the White House. The National Journal's Sarah Mimms wrote, that after the WH veto threat, ""Reid threw in the towel-walking away from the negotiations and leaving the mess for another Democrat to sort out with Republicans, who are enjoying the fractious show across the aisle."" See what I mean? Let's don't let the press corps rush the House and Senate Republicans into premature action on legislation that can wait until 2015. Where's the fire?

BREAKING: House Passes Symbolic Measure to 'Block' Obama's Executive Amnesty

It's symbolic because it'sdead on arrival in Harry Reid's Senate (a formulation that will meet its glorious expiration date in a few weeks), and because President Obama has alreadyissued a veto threat if Reid and company accidentally passed the thing.  Congressional Republicans, and some Democrats, believe that Obama lacks the authority to imposehis amnesty fiat. Obama disagrees, naturally -- although hisstance on that question was bothadamant and completely different not too long ago. Barack Obama's legal constraints depend on Barack Obama's political needs.Regardless,this afternoon's vote was little more than an on-the-record 'sense of the House' rebuke:

JUST IN: House votes 219 to 197, 3 voted present, to block Obama from changing immigration laws by executive authority Ed O'Keefe (@edatpost) December 4, 2014


A small handful of partisans on each side broke with their parties; conservative Democrats, and a number of Republicans fromheavily Hispanic districts.  The narrative that this vote was at its core about immigration, rather than preserving the Constitutional order, was too powerful for some to resist, evidently. Which helps explain why the White House has zero problem flouting the law and pushing executive power as far as its has: Republicans havefew viable retaliatory options, and the separation of powers issue at stake is easily sidetracked anddemagogued as just more proof that theGOP hates brown people, or whatever. So long as the public loathes the idea of a shutdown, and so long as that same public is primed to reflexively blame Republicans for any shutdown, the GOP is basically cornered. They and their base don't want to allow Obama's power grab to go unchallenged, but many ofthetools at their disposal aren't politically attractive or practical. Hence the White House'sextraordinary arrogance.

Aswe discussed earlier in the week, the ""best"" course of actionon the table involves passing a temporary budget tofund virtually all of the government through next September, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security, whose money would only be extended for a few months. When that cash expires and is in need of a re-up, the GOP could use that appropriations fight to try to de-fund the executive amnesty to whatever extent is possible through the (which may bequite limited). That said, couldn't they at leastrefuse to allot funds forthis hiring spree? The problem with this plan -- aside from questions about how many funding stringsCongresscan actually pull on this front -- is that it involves approving a roughly ten-month spending plan for the overwhelming majority of federal expenses next week, whichcritics argue givesCongressionalDemocrats too much lastinginfluence over government outlays, long after they've been tossed out of power. I discussed today's votes and the road ahead on Gretchen Carlson's show earlier this afternoon:



I should make that final point more often. Why is DHS trying to hire 1,000 bureaucrats to help administer an amnesty that supposedly just entails ""enforcement discretion"" that involves the federal government not acting? Because the president's decree also doles out millions of legal work permits, which seems far beyond the purview of mere discretion. That's a concreteshift in policy -- also known as 'changing the law,' as Obama put it before the White House had towalk back his accidental truth-telling.

More and more Christmas shoppers rely on online retail now than ever, and sometimes that means that they're buying from overseas. It might not be widely known, but shipping from Asia is ludicrously low - and it's because of an international United Nations agreement and a special deal between the U.S. Postal Service and the Chinese government mail carrier.

As reported in the Washington Post, this means that goods from overseas are much, much cheaper to ship than goods made in the United States:


The USPS offers this service, called ePacket, to foreign postal operators looking to increase global trade with the United States, spokeswoman Darlene S. Casey said in an e-mail. It has proven popular. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2012, China nearly tripled the number of packages sent under this program, from 9.5 million to 26.8 million. Revenues quadrupled. Casey also noted that the USPS relies on business income, not tax dollars, to fund its operations. (It lost another $5 billion last fiscal year.)

But this has still been a money sink for the Postal Service. In 2012, USPS was paid only 94 cents on average for each piece of Chinese ePacket mail, according to a February report from the Postal Services inspector generals office. That report estimated that the Postal Service was losing about a dollar on each incoming item, adding up to a $29.4 million net loss in 2012.


Forums on eBay are filled with angry notes about ePacket. I must say that it is simply an economic disaster for US Sellers, one person wrote. One product that we sell for 2.00 with 2.50 shipping a chinese company is selling for .99 with free shipping, another complained. The person added, Too much work no money here anymore. Let the Chinese have it.


Of course, as the Post notes toward the end, upshot of this is that American consumers have access to cheaply-produced goods at hugely-reduced prices. But what it also means is that we can't say that manufacturers are fighting on a level playing field: when it costs less to send something from China than it does from the United States, something is amiss - especially with a USPS that is hemorrhaging money.

North Korea Declares Cyber War with Sony Pictures 
Night Watch | Dec 04, 2014













Share on Facebook

North Korea:North Korea refused to deny responsibility for a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures. California-based Sony Pictures' computer system went down last week and hackers published a number of as-yet unreleased films on online download sites. Sony is investigating after its computers were attacked and unreleased films made available on the internet. When asked if it was involved in the attack a spokesman for the North Korean government replied: ""Wait and see."" In June, North Korea complained to the United Nations and the US about the comedy filmThe Interview.In the movie, two reporters are granted an audience with Kim Jong-un. The CIA then enlists the pair to assassinate him. North Korea described the film as an act of war and an ""undisguised sponsoring of terrorism."" It called on the US and the UN to block it. Comment:The public domain contains no information that confirms North Korean culpability, but the trailer for the film is so juvenile and insulting that a North Korean cyber-attack would be plausible. North Korea is known to have invested heavily in cyber warfare as a force multiplier. .Ukraine:The Ukrainian military says pro-Russian rebels attacked its forces at Donetsk airport, despite a ceasefire deal earlier in the day. The statement on Facebook said rebel shelling shattered the calm soon after both sides had ended their meeting. ""There was a lull at Donetsk airport during the day,"" a Ukrainian military statement said, but after the ceasefire talks ""the terrorists resumed attacks on the airport terminals."" Fighting at the airport has been taking place for three days. The rebels hold the city of Donetsk, but not the airport. Earlier the rebels reported a truce at the airport. Plus negotiators, including Europeans and a Russian general announced a new ceasefire agreement in Luhansk region. Under the new deal for Luhansk, the sides agreed to a ceasefire starting on Friday. A withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of confrontation was agreed, to begin on Saturday, 6 December, but the width of the demilitarized zone was not specified. Comment:The battle lines have changed little. However some political shift seems to be taking place. The presence of a Russian general in the ceasefire talks signifies an admission and escalation of Russia's overt involvement in trying to shape the political endgame. Kenya:Al-Shaba'ab terrorists from Somalia killed at least 36 miners in an attack on a stone quarry in Mandera, northern Kenya. About 20 gunmen, described by the Kenyan government as ""heavily armed bandits"" executed all non-Muslim men working at the mine. Several people were beheaded, while the others were shot in the back of the head. Al-Shaba'ab claimed responsibility for the attack. ""This latest attack was part of a series of attacks planned and executed by the Mujahideen to serve as a response to Kenya's occupation of Muslim lands and their ongoing atrocities therein, such as the recent air strikes on Muslims in Somalia,"" al-Shaba'ab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said in a statement emailed to journalists.  Comment:The latest attack is about 30km from the 22 November attack on a bus in which 28 non-Muslims were separated from the Muslim passengers before being executed. This attack seems to have served no purpose except terror and possibly local tribal interests. On Monday, al-Shaba'ab fighters reportedly attacked a night club in the Kenyan town of Wajir. One person was killed and at least 12 injured as gunmen hurled grenades and sprayed bullets at the building, the government said. Comment:The increase in attacks in Kenya means that the African Union forces are having some success in driving al-Shaba'ab fighters from Somalia. The downside is that the Kenyans, who have combat forces in Somalia, failed to secure the border and to prepare to intercept al-Shaba'ab groups who fled to Kenya seeking refuge andrevenge.

""The Advent of Controversy""

Another Christmas season begins. Get ready to read the headlines of the new lawsuits by the ""civil libertarians"" ready to throw the baby-in-the-manger out with the bathwater. I remember years ago when somebody called the Christmas season, ""The Advent of Controversy.""  Why is Christmas such a big deal? Let's put it this way---why do groups like the ACLU, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State invest time, money, and energy to fight any vestige of religious meaning to the holiday?  I remember what Christian commentator Janice Crouse, formerly with Concerned Women for America, told our listeners when I interviewed her for a TV special hosted by the late Dr. D. James Kennedy. The special was ""What If Jesus Had Never Been Born?,"" based on our book.   Crouse said, When you see the atheist attack manger scenes, you might think, This is an innocuous kind of thing. What do they have against a manger scene for crying out loud? It gives you some idea of how powerful Jesus Christ is. If He were not powerful, what would they care?   For the last generation or so, there has been a fascination with UFOs and with speculations of life out there on some other planet. But what if ours is what J. B. Phillips once called ""the visited planet""? That is, what if at one time God Himself visited our planet---beginning as a baby?  That's precisely what the controversy over Christmas is all about. We believe, as Paul said to the Galatians, in the fullness of time, God sent His one and only Son. He came to die for our offenses against a holy God. He died so we don't have to. Those who knowingly reject Him will be punished for their own sins. Their pride blinds them to their need for the Savior who came.  This baby in the manger was fully God and yet fully human. As the Nicene Creed (325 AD) declares about Jesus: that He is ""God from God, Light from Light, True God from True God, Begotten not made, One in being with the Father""   For a father to be a father, he has to have a child. Christians believe God the Father---the eternal Father---has always been the Father of Jesus Christ---the eternal Son. And the Spirit is divine. If Christ were not divine, how could He be our Savior? But how so also if He were not human?   Jesus is God? A few years ago, millions of Americans read the novel by Dan Brown, The DaVinci Code. The novel made some rather novel claims about who Jesus was. That book tries to make the claim that Christs divinity was not held by the early church until decreed by the Council of Nicea because of the Roman emperor Constantine---and at that, it was a close vote.  Here are some quotes from the book: ""'My dear,' Teabing declared, 'until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by his followers as a mortal prophet...a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless. A mortal.'""  The character goes on to say: ""Jesus's establishment as 'the Son of God' was officially proposed and voted on by the Council of Nicaea.A relatively close vote at that.""   And he adds: ""Nonetheless, establishing Christ's divinity was critical to the further unification of the Roman empire and to the new Vatican power base. By officially endorsing Jesus as the Son of God, Constantine turned Jesus into a deity who existed beyond the scope of the human world, an entity whose power was unchallengeable.""   There are so many historical errors here that its amazing. Let me adjust one or two. First of all, that vote wasnt close at all. The vote was 318 to 2. Secondly, Christians were worshiping Jesus as God from the very beginning. The New Testament, completed before 100 AD, is full of instances that reveal the divinity of Christ.   One of them comes from the opening of John's Gospel, which declares, ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" It says He was the Co-Creator.  From secular history, we can also see Jesus was worshiped as divine. Here's just one example. Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator in an area in what is now Turkey, wrote to the Emperor Trajan around the year 115 and explained how he had gotten some information about the Christians by torturing a couple of deaconesses.   Pliny found out that the Christians worshiped on the first day of the week (Sunday), that they made a commitment to obey the Ten Commandments, and that they sang hymns and worshiped Christ as God. So its totally inaccurate to say this was just created by the Nicene Council.  The third point is in reference to Constantine. He gets a bad rap these days---even from Christians. Let me just say that when he became a Christian, it was a God-send to the Christian Church. After centuries of persecution, he gave the Christians freedom. It was a later emperor (Theodosius) who declared the empire ""Christian,"" while it still contained many pagans.   If Jesus were divine, is it hard to believe He could turn water into wine, walk on water, and rise from the dead? We're still talking about these things 2000 years later.  Former skeptic and Oxford/Cambridge professor C. S. Lewis said: ""The central miracle asserted by Christians is the Incarnation. They say that God became Man. Every other miracle prepares for this, or exhibits this, or results from this.In the Christian story God descends to re-ascend. He comes down; down from the heights of absolute being into TIME and space, down into humanitydown to the very roots and sea-bed of the Nature He has created.""    So why the opposition to Jesus, at Christmastime or otherwise? Jesus summed it up in one sentence: ""Light has come into the world, but men prefer darkness because their deeds are evil.""

President Obamas cornerstone healthcare program, The Affordable Care Act, always created one question in my mind.  How does it work when you add millions of new patients to a system and dont increase the number of doctors and nurses proportionately???  Obviously full parking lots and long lines in the waiting room.  It would seem you are simply putting a square peg into a round hole.  Putting it a different way-THE MATH DOESNT WORK.  The 44th, and now Janet Yellen, has stressed the college degree as one of the major solutions to our economic woes.  Get the degree, get the job and life is sweet.  Unfortunately when ABC University graduates 25 new Anthropology majors there are not 25 new Anthropology jobs created in the universe.  The fact is that since the ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) the attrition rate has shrunk and the old geezers who were supposed to retire wont or cant and dont ride off into the sunset-THE MATH DOESNT WORK.  Now were asked to believe the addition of 5 million illegal, oops Undocumented, immigrants to an overstressed job market will have no negative impact???  Much is made of the contributions made by immigrants on the birth and growth of the United   States of America.  After all, didnt the First Lady say the Founding Fathers really werent Americans!???  Many of the Fortune 500 companies were started by those who came with nothing in their pockets.  There is no denying the historical contribution of immigrants.  That was then this is now.    According to certain folk the unleashing of 5 million new Undocumented into the workforce is exactly the shot in the arm that we need.    Some will argue many are already in the system and the President has just brought them out of the shadows.  Unfortunately or fortunately, the fear of deportation has kept many from taking the kind of job that does require legal paperwork.    Now that that little item has been dispensed with, those people can really do the kind of job that will secure their future.  That job already has the retiree in it, a college kid who needs it and now the Undocumented who wants it.    The employer is salivating since his one job is in high demand meaning a wage that is nowhere near what it used to be.  The law of supply and demand has not been repealed and the addition, annually, of millions of new college graduates and now millions of new Undocumented's prove in the job market:  THE MATH DOESNT WORK!

ST. PAUL, Minn. Minnesotalegislators boosted the local government aid program for cities by $80 million in 2013andsold it as a slam dunk towardlowering property tax levies.I would expect well see local government officials delighted to take the additional resources that the state provides and use that to reduce the property tax burden, because they hear about it just as much as we do here, Democratic Gov.

...for Louisiana, that is. She may not own a home there, but if the latest public opinion survey to emerge from the state is any indication, Sen. Mary Landrieu's (D-LA) electoral fate is already predetermined. The Washington Examiners David M. Drucker reports:
Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy is poised for a landslide victory over Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in a Saturday runoff election in Louisiana, according to a GOP poll shared with the Washington Examiner.
Cassidy led Landrieu 57 percent to 33 percent in the survey conducted Nov. 24-25 by WPA Opinion Research for Independent Womens Voice. His victory would bring the number of Republican Senate seats captured in this years midterm elections to nine, topping off the new GOP majority at 54 seats. The poll of 500 likely voters had an error margin of 4.4 percentage points. 
The internals are much worse for Sen. Landrieu:
 Among men ages 18-54, Cassidy led Landrieu 56 percent to 31 percent.
 Among men ages 55 and up, Cassidy led Landrieu 61 percent to 28 percent.
 Among women ages 18-54, Cassidy led Landrieu 61 percent to 32 percent.
 Among women ages 55 and up, Cassidy led Landrieu 50 percent to 40 percent.
 Among independent voters, Cassidy led Landrieu 67 percent to 23 percent. 


Again, this is a GOP-friendly survey conducted by pollsters who may indeed be giving Cassidy an unfair advantage. But even if thats the case, Sen. Landrieus across-the-board, double-digit deficits among key demographics is almost certainly putting this race out of contention. Sen. Landrieu, meanwhile, hasnt done herself any favors by injecting vileness into the campaign on numerous occasions after her Keystone XL pipeline gambit fell through, or by taking swipes at her opponent for truly laughable reasons. 
Guy, for his part, recently congratulated Team Landrieu for reaching full meltdown status. So perhaps in two days' time, don't be surprised if the Democratic moneylenders who abandoned her campaign prematurely -- and for the right reasons -- are finally vindicated.

The internet giveth, and the internet taketh away. Today the internet was in full-blown ""giveth"" mode, when the PAC ""Stand With Hillary"" released this absolutely glorious gem of a country song begging her to run for president in 2016.
You literally can't make this stuff up.

Looking back in time, learning hindsights always right. We came together in 08, a defining moment we all can celebrate. And now its 20-16 and this time Im a thinking, Guys, put your boots on and lets smash this ceiling.
Oh I been thinkin about one great lady Like the women in my life, Shes a mother, a daughter, and through it all shes a loving wife.
Oh, there is something about herthis great lady. Caring, hard working once a First lady She fights for country n my family. Now its time for us to Stand Up with Hillary Hillary. Stand with Hillary
The video includes various throwback pictures of the Clinton family interspersed with images of blue-collar, working-class rural America.
Naturally, Twitter reacted appropriately:
My favorite kind of parody is when extreme earnestness and mockery are indistinguishable.  This: https://t.co/vycBxq2faA Michael Munger (@mungowitz) December 4, 2014

OK, this is the first time I've actually thought Hillary will lose in 2016. http://t.co/e82HN4xMqy Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) December 4, 2014

Someone literally took the time to write an entire song AND THEN MADE A VIDEO for Hillary Clinton. Is this real life?! Krystle (@TarheelKrystle) December 4, 2014

Clinton's popularity numbers have nosedived. She has not yet confirmed she is running for president in 2016, but said she would have a decision by January.
In the meantime, I'll just sit here patiently waiting for Stand With Hillary's pro-Hillary pop-punk ballad.

As we saw last weekend at the start of the St. Louis Rams-Raiders game, we'll be dealing with the facts and symbolism of Michael Brown's death for a long time.""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" doesn't accurately describe what really happened when Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot Brown to death last summer.But it should be pretty clear to everyone by now that the facts don't matter that much anymore in the Michael Brown case.At least half the country, 99 percent of the liberal media and the Black Caucus in Congress apparently still believe the ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" myth, just as they believe that St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch is a stupid or dishonest prosecutor.McCulloch was accused of taking the easy way out by putting the decision of whether to indict Wilson in the hands of a secret grand jury instead of indicting officer Wilson and going straight to a public trial.Meanwhile, roving professional race baiters like Al Sharpton and liberal media pundits accused McCulloch of, among other things, being a smirking racist, a protector of bad cops and behaving more like a defense lawyer for Wilson than a public prosecutor.But I don't buy any of it. I think McCulloch handled the Michael Brown case brilliantly.Once he started to see the evidence himself, in his role as district attorney, he realized where it was leading.He saw that credible black witnesses corroborated officer Wilson's story and debunked the ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" claim that activists and CNN were pushing every night.McCulloch desperately needed the testimony of black witnesses. But he knew they'd testify only if they could appear in front of a secret grand jury.He knew they'd be afraid to show up at a public trial where they'd be seen by members of their own community who might retaliate against them.McCulloch realized he had to get all of the evidence out in front of the grand jury because he knew he'd never be able to get all of it out at a public trial.He presented the testimony to the grand jury and still protected the black witnesses from being threatened or hurt by those who'd rather riot and burn things than determine the truth.So I say McCulloch was a genius. He didn't destroy or corrupt the legal process in Ferguson. He saved it.As for the tragic death of Michael Brown, obviously it should never have happened.But Brown's case does not deserve to be held up as an example of an innocent young black man being unjustifiably or casually shot down by a white police force.He didn't die because he was black, or because officer Wilson or the Ferguson police force was racist. Brown died because he was stupid.If anyone of us, black or white, had a young son who did the same dumb things Brown did in the last minutes of his life, he would have ended up at the local funeral home too.There are important issues the country needs to address about how to improve the relationship between police and black communities.And we need to train and equip police in better ways, so that encounters between cops and unarmed citizens of all races and colors are as safe as possible.The Eric Garner chokehold case in New York proves we still have a lot of work to do. Until we solve these complicated policing problems, I have some advice.If you don't want to get shot dead by a cop, don't rob a convenience store, don't try to grab a cop's gun and don't charge the cop after he orders you to stop.

Thanksgiving week, GOP House aide Elizabeth Lauten posted an admonishment of first daughters Sasha and Malia Obama on her Facebook page: ""I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class,"" it began. And: ""Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar."" By Monday, Lauten had resigned as communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn. Call it her modest contribution to the notion of showing a little class.Of course Lauten had to go. The president's children, ages 13 and 16, don't deserve to be collateral damage in the snark wars of social media.That said, did Lauten's post have to be played as such a big story? Credit journalism's breathless rush to umbrage. As The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway noted, The Washington Post ran three Associated Press stories, as well as eight staff blogs and posts, on the Lauten gaffe. A Post foreign-affairs reporter actually investigated Lauten's articles in her student newspaper. That story kindly included a TMZ item about Lauten's being arrested in 2000 on a charge of misdemeanor larceny, later dropped.Conservatives watch the witch hunt, secure in the belief that liberal bias drove this story. This is how it works: If a story reinforces Beltway stereotypes about Republicans -- if it makes the right look stupid or mean -- it's news. If a story makes R's look both stupid and mean, it's big news.The day after Lauten resigned, Donny Ray Williams Jr. pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting two women in 2010. At the time, he was an aide for Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., on her Senate disaster recovery subcommittee. The Washington Post reported on the guilty plea, but don't expect the story to get the traction of Lauten's flameout.News organizations have become obsessed with what public officials say rather than what they do. One reason: It's easier to report on bad Facebook posts than on sexual assaults. You just throw the words up on a screen or a page. There's no ambiguity.You could argue that Williams' assaults, which make his behavior criminal but not national news, didn't reflect on Landrieu. But given Lauten's quick fall from grace, her Facebook post didn't reflect on the GOP, either.If bad quotes alone make for good stories, then there should have been more reportage on Jonathan Gruber. He's the MIT economist and Obamacare consultant caught on tape explaining how the Obama administration deliberately misled the public on the Affordable Care Act. The self-satisfied Gruber chalked up his success in fooling the public to ""the stupidity of the American voter."" The San Francisco Chronicle ran one piece on Gruber's dust-up -- mine.Whose poor choice of words had more of an effect on American life? Gruber's.The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza rejects the charge that liberal bias led to blanket coverage of l'affaire Lauten. He didn't think the Lauten post was a big story, but it included elements that increased its news value: Trashing innocent teens brings out the media's protective instincts; it was a slow news week; and the story generated Internet traffic. Of course it did; there were so many reports.

Race is like gender. As society becomes more equal in those areas, leftist instigators resort to making up conflicts in order to create victim status where there is no longer much left. The Ferguson riots are a classic example. Every day across the country, police officers shoot criminals and nothing happens; there is no outcry or rioting, because the police officer is not white and the perpetrator is not black. But if the police officer is white and the perpetrator is black, suddenly the race baiters care, and instead of waiting for the facts to come out or an adjudication by a jury of peers in a court of law, they declare that the shooting was the result of racism.   Political researcher Trevor Loudon has written an exposeon the left-wing activists who organized the violent Ferguson protests, detailing their long histories of inciting riots. Lisa Fithian, a white woman known as Professor Occupy for her leadership organizing Occupy Wall Street, trained people specifically for the Ferguson riots.   The ramifications of this trial by race baiters are deadly and only serve to needlessly worsen race relations. The Ferguson confrontation was provoked after Michael Brown was filmedin a convenience store surveillance video threatening and assaulting a shopkeeper, then committing strong-arm robbery of a package of cigarellos. Officer Darren Wilson, who was assigned to follow up on the crime, said he shot Brown in self defense. Brown refused to succumb to arrest and instead charged him, reaching for his gun.   The official autopsy revealedthat Brown had been shot six times from the front and had marijuana in his system. Two other autopsies, one ordered by Browns family and one by the FBI, also found that none of the six shots hit Brown in the back. Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist in San Francisco, saidone of the wounds was consistent with Brown reaching for Wilsons gun, and none reflected that he was running away or had his hands in the air.   Paul Cassell, a law professor at S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, reviewed thousands of pages of testimony by the grand jury witnesses and concludedthey supported Officer Wilsons version of events. Additionally, Wikipedia reports, According to several people close to the grand jury investigation, seven or eight witnesses have given testimony consistent with Wilson's account  Speaking on condition of anonymity to The Washington Post, the sources said that the witnesses are all African American, and that they have not spoken publicly out of fear for their safety.   The race baiters ignored the autopsy reports, instead pointing to conflicting testimony by witnesses - even though the witnesses who placed blame on Officer Wilson later admittedthey had not seen the shooting. Professor Cassell finds it odd there has been so little interest in the physical evidence. He suggests, Perhaps the reason for this disinterest in the ballistics report, autopsies and other similar information is that for at least some of Browns supporters the facts are, apparently, largely irrelevantbecause Brown is a metaphorical symbolof injustice regardless of what actually happened.  The grand jury, composed of three blacks and nine whites, listened to testimony from more than 60 witnesses before determining there was not enough evidence to go forward with an indictment. This is even more significant considering the level of proof required for an indictment in order to start prosecution is only probable cause, not beyond a reasonable doubt as is required for a guilty verdict at the conclusion of a trial. Additionally, the prosecutor gave jurors the discretion to find probable cause for a multitude of crimes, ranging from negligent manslaughter to intentional murder. Nevertheless, 9 of the 12 jurors would not agree to indict Wilson on anything.  Immediately after the jury announced the decision not to indict, the stepfather of Michael Brown, Louis Head,turned to the crowd of demonstrators and cried, ""Burn this motherf***er down"" and ""Burn this b*** down,"" recorded in a New York Timesvideo. Soon afterwards, many businesses were looted and burnedto the ground, including small businesses owned by blacks. A photowent viral of Natalie DuBose crying, a black woman who owned a bakery that was vandalized.   In contrast to Browns stepfather, who allegedlyhas a criminal record, his real father released a videoto the Ferguson community prior to the verdict saying, No matter what the grand jury decides, I do not want my sons death to be in vain  hurting others or destroying property is not the answer. After the rioting started, he toldCNN, ""The ones looting and rioting, they are doing it on their own agenda.""  Bizarrely, Ferguson Chief of Police Thomas Jackson - who is responsible for keeping the peace, upholding the law and protecting citizens - at one point attempted to joinprotesters who were calling for his resignation. Not surprisingly, within 30 seconds the attempt ended in violence, and riot police jumped in to protect him. Democrat Governor Jay Nixon also botched handling the protests. The National Guard should have been in place ready to stop rioters from pouring gas on businesses and setting them on fire. Sadly, like Jackson, Nixon appears to have been more interested in appeasing the race baiters than public safety.   Seeing the looting brazenly taking place, members of the patriotic organization Oath Keepers, made up of former law enforcement and military, flew in from all over the country and did what the government would not, standing armed on the roofs of businesses to protect them. Incredibly, police threatenedthe Oath Keepers and made them leave, despite the gratitude of several store owners who had been looted.   The lack of journalistic ethics has been appalling. The New York Timessent a reporterto cover the riots who had a shoplifting conviction herself. That reporter published the name of the street she thought Officer Wilson lived on, knowingly jeopardizing his life. The newspaper reprinted a retraction and it was later observed that Wilson no longer owned the house with his ex-wife, but it didnt appear that the reporter knew nor cared when she included it. It is a crime in most states to publish the home address of a law enforcement officer.   Officer Wilsons life appears virtually destroyed, and will likely never be the same unless he leaves Ferguson. Despite the fact he was fully exonerated by a jury, and had an unblemished career with the police department, he was forced to resign with no severance pay.   It is also sad how Brown has been used as a pawn of the race baiters after his unfortunate death. Brown made a foolish mistake by stopping at a convenience store after he had gotten high. Many people have done something this stupid and tragically fatal. But they would not want their death to result in more deaths and destruction, especially within their own community, crying racism yet hurting their own race. The white leftist agitators instigating the riots would rather hurt more blacks in the community than heed the pleas of Browns black father.   If the race baiters and violent left-wing agitators were really concerned about racism, they would focus their efforts on areas plagued with real racism. The U.S. is one of the least racistcountries in the world. The race baiters will not, because stopping racism is not their agenda. Dismantling the free market and capitalism, and ultimately the United States by any means including anarchy, is their real agenda.

For the first post-racial president weve ever had, this is working out about just as I expected. The candidate Obama acted responsibly during the election of 2008 when he had to reassure white voters that he was really one of them. Since then has become a radical black activist, parroting the worst features of the cold, racial war that is an ugly and unfortunate feature of American life.  The contrast tells us that Obama knows what hes doing.  He exploits race in the same way Elizabeth Warren has, in the same way Al Sharpton has. If Tawana Brawley had been raped last month-- Brawley youll remember was the black teen who a grand jury believed may have invented a story about being gang raped by white men to avoid being punished by her mother and first brought Sharpton to fame-- I think wed know where Rev. Obama and his high priest Eric Holder would be standing (right next to her).  And theyd be standing next to her demanding justice without due processalso known as lynchingin the same way they did in Boston, MA, in Sanford, FL and in Ferguson, MO. And if Reverend Wright, Obamas advising clergy from Chicago, says G*d damn America for her sins on race, then I think the rest of us can say g*d damn Obamafiguratively, not literallyfor his sins on race.  Personally, I would like to see everyone saved. But I think I can say salvation for this country on race issues has become harder not easier thanks to Obama.  I would like to see racial issues talked about in this country.  I just hate seeing them lied about. So, yeah: g*d damn Obama. Hes helped to destroy a peaceful community in Ferguson, which while not perfect, is still superior to the hell hole that Democrats have created on Chicagos South and West side for the African American community.  That kids cant walk to school safely, that kids are killed while having sleepovers, that murders happen while the police fake the numbers to cover up the crimes is the worst and most insulting type of racism.  Its even worse than the joke of a school system that fails blacks regularly. Its even worse than the unemployment and income figures that show blacks left behind during the worst recovery we have ever had. Its even worse than the incarceration rates for black males, or the morbidity and longevity rates for black men. And its the reason why Obama has nothing left to do but grandstand in Boston, Sanford and Ferguson.  If Obama had to admit that the Democrat Party that controls Chicago, or Detroit, or Oakland or Gary, IN is his party, and that he supports THAT kind of racism, then hed have to admit to the black community that indeed he is the worst type of racist when it comes to African Americans. So hes content instead admit to some Americans clear-sighted enough to see it that hes the worst type of racist for ALL Americans. Hes the type of racist that makes racism worse when hes through.  And unfortunately, hes not through yet.  But one thing is clear already, after he was elected the first black president to govern a modern, Western, largely white nation, hes made racism worse, not better, g*d damn him.

'THE LOUDER he talked of his honor,"" wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1860, ""the faster we counted our spoons."" As a resident of Massachusetts, Emerson knew better than to take at face value anything public officials say about their own rectitude. That was a prudent attitude a century and a half ago. It's just as prudent now.
So when Beacon Hill created a high-powered ""advisory commission"" to evaluate the salaries paid to top elected officers and lawmakers, only a naf could have doubted it would come back with anything but a recommendation for hefty pay raises all around  and pitch that recommendation as a matter of fairness, honor, and good government. Huge increases in what are already among the highest salaries paid to legislative leaders and statewide officials in America, concluded the commission in a report released Monday, is the best way to attract ""publicly spirited and honest individuals"" to state government. More lavish paychecks will ""ensure that there is not a temptation to betray the public trust.""
Quick, count the spoons.
News stories have focused on the commission's call for hiking the governor's total compensation by nearly $100,000 a year, and boosting the six-figure salary of the House speaker and Senate president by more than 70 percent. Since governor-elect Charlie Baker says he would ""probably veto"" any such legislation, the Legislature may try to get the pay hikes passed before Baker takes office in January.
But the biggest affront in this plan is the element that has drawn the least attention: the commission's unlawful scheme to engineer a raise for rank-and-file legislators.
In the long-running saga of Beacon Hill pay raises, underhanded maneuvering has been the norm. Late at night on Halloween in 1979, lawmakers rammed through a bill hiking their pay with no public hearing or advance notice. Three years later the Legislature returned to the trough, attaching a 50 percent raise for its members to a judicial pay measure, which couldn't be blocked by referendum. In 1987, another ploy: A sizable (and retroactive) legislative salary increase was passed with an ""emergency preamble,"" which made it effective immediately  and immune to repeal until it was nearly two years old. In 1994, Governor William Weld  days after claiming that still another pay hike was ""not something we're considering""  colluded with legislative leaders to pass a bill enlarging the salaries of House and Senate members by a stunning 55 percent.
Time and again, Beacon Hill politicos have justified such avarice by lamenting that they had no better option  that there is never an acceptable way for elected officials to give themselves a raise.
But then they devised one: They would put a cost-of-living adjustment for legislative salaries right into the state constitution, and forswear forever the right to vote on their own pay. In 1988, Massachusetts voters were invited to approve a proposed constitutional amendment that would, once and for all, put the issue to rest. ""A Yes vote would prohibit state legislators from changing their base pay,"" explained the official voter guide, ""and instead would adjust that pay according to changes in median household income.""
Voters agreed. The amendment passed handily. Massachusetts lawmakers looked forward complacently to receiving automatic biennial raises as a constitutional right, forever. And sure enough, their salaries went up by a few percentage points every two years, in keeping with the amendment's explicit formula adjusting legislative pay in tandem with median household income.
Until median household income stopped going up in the wake of the Great Recession.
In 2011, legislative base pay was trimmed by 0.5 percent. In 2013 it dropped by another 1.8 percent. After a decade of scoring regular raises without having to do anything to justify them  hey, it's in the constitution!  the Legislature was suddenly confronted with the reality that salaries can go down, too.
But that's not a reality every lawmaker is prepared to accept. And  surprise, surprise!  their ""advisory commission"" says they shouldn't have to. The panel recommends a new method of calculating changes in Massachusetts state income, one that relies on statewide income data ""in the aggregate, not the median."" That may sound boringly technical, but the bottom line is crystal-clear: The commission's recommended method would have raised legislators' pay in 2011 and 2013.
But aggregate income isn't what the constitution specifies. The amendment drafted by the Legislature  and approved by the voters in a landslide  made ""median income"" the touchstone. It forbids lawmakers from voting for anything else. Beacon Hill, for once, has been hoist with its own petard.
Assuming, that is, that in Massachusetts, the constitution rules. Does it?

Socialist Party Caught ""Underpaying"" Minimum Wage Activists  
Michael Schaus | Dec 04, 2014

 SHARES




















Lets just be honest here: Socialists arent great with economic theory. I mean, Im sure there is such a thing as an economically savvy commie But theyre probably too busy stuffing their money into non-taxable assetsto really bother with articulating their socialist agenda. (Yeah Im looking your way, George Soros.) A Seattle affiliate of the National Socialist party is fighting for a $20 minimum wage. Ostensibly, this extraordinarily high wage for flipping burgers and holding free car wash signs (no doubt while wearing a flamboyantly colored sandwich-board) will help alleviate the plight of the underpaid; and help the workers of the world fight against the bourgeois monarchy of American capitalism Or something.  But, theres just one problem: The silly socialists need to get a handful of people to help fight for this noble and just cause. Apparently, the socialist movement isnt what it used to be (darn Reagan); and therefore the Party needs to shell out some cash to cover the costs associated with hiring people to picket, organize, and propagandize their redistributive proposals Unfortunately, the highest hourly wage they can currently offer aspiring Robin Hoods, who wish to plunder the profitable, is a mere 13 bucks.  Thats right Our Socialist agitators, who demand a livable wage of at least $20 per hour can only afford to shell out $13 for each of their loyal activists. Of course, they have a good reason for their blatant hypocrisy: They cant afford the higher figure for which they fight.  Well Duh.  Its kinda cute when pinko-commies run headlong into a wall of fiscal reality, isnt it?  According to Doug Barnes, the National Secretary for the Freedom Socialist Party (and yes Im letting that name go by without an ounce of sarcastic criticism), the organization cant afford to pay their employees a livable minimum wage, because they dont get enough donations.  Were practicing what were preaching in terms of continuing to fight for the minimum wage, Barnes told the HuffPo. But we cant pay a lot more than $13. Oh. So, in other words, you tend to pay your employees a fair wage based off of their abilities as revenues allow. (You capitalist pigs!) Barnes also explained that, in an ideal world, he would pay his employees $22 per hour. But, lets not get carried away here Hes not going to pay for it out of his pocket.  In all fairness, the organization is hoping that a higher minimum wage will allow its low-wage party members to donate a little more, therefore boosting revenues. Which, could be true for the donors who dont get laid off from their jobs as businesses cope with that whole cost vs revenue thing, with which the Socialist Party seems to be dealing.  The Lefts tactic to purchase the votes of low-income workers (with someone elses money) tends to fall apart in the real world And, as the Socialist Party seems to be demonstrating, it is not merely a matter of greed. The bourgeois is not simply plundering the labor of the proletariat. As it turns out, economics might actually play a role in determining the monetary value of someones labor.  As Seattles Freedom Socialist Party demonstrates, wages are a function of revenue and value Personally, I think $13 per hour is too much for any socialist. But, I guess its still a free market.

BILCHYE ZOLOTA, Ukraine  Myroslav Boiko has been leading tourists through the dark, narrow passageways of this rural region's unique cave systems since 2002. During an hour-long tour, he indulges his guests curiosities about the Trypillian culture, the ancient people archaeologists believe once inhabited the caves, some 5,000 to 6,000 years ago.But what Mr. Boiko really wants to talk about occurred in more recent memory, when the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), a ragtag group of nationalists fighting for independence from the Soviet Union, turned the caves into a network of underground bunkers from 1944 to 1946. It was here under the dripping stalactites that they hid out, stockpiled their weapons, and plotted their strategy.Every Ukrainian should come here to educate themselves about who thesebanderovtsiwere, he said, using a reference to those like the UPA who idolize Ukrainian nationalist Stepan Bandera. Its high time their true history was told publicly and they were recognized officially as heroes of Ukraine.

But even as the UPA and Bandera are lionized in western Ukraine as inspiration for the Euromaidan protests that toppled pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych, they are vilified in the east as Nazi collaborators fighting against Russians. And western enthusiasm for the UPA is causing fears in the east that Kievs new Western-leaning government is looking to adopt a similarly anti-Russian stance.

Historians say that the truth about the UPA and Bandera, like so much about todays Ukrainian crisis, is distorted by myths coming from both sides of the conflict. And the complexities of Ukraines past are hampering the development of a national identity in a country that has been torn by Russias annexation of Crimea and the violent conflict with pro-Russia rebels that has now claimed more than 4,300 lives.Bandera and the UPAThe legacies of the UPA and Bandera have often been used as a political tool in Ukraines contentious post-Soviet history. Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, suggestions of recognizing UPA veterans and Bandera as official Heroes of Ukraine have sparked street protests, parliamentary brawls, and voter backlash.Bandera dates back before the Soviet takeover in 1939 of what is now western Ukraine, when he led the fight against Poland's rule. When the Germans invaded western Ukraine in 1941, Bandera declared an independent Ukraine. The Germans were not amused, and he was arrested and held in a German concentration camp until late in the war.While Bandera languished in prison, the radical independence group he belonged to launched its paramilitary wing, the UPA, in 1942 to establish an independent Ukrainian state. The UPA killed thousands to that end, including both Soviet officers forcing collectivization in Ukraine and tens of thousands of Poles and Jews in 1943-44 in what are known as the Volhynia Massacres.The Kremlin labeled the UPA as ""collaborators"" who fought Soviet forces alongside the Nazis. For decades, Soviet history textbooks taught that the UPA was an enemy of the peaceful Soviet people during the USSR's struggle to defeat fascism in the Great Patriotic War.Before the war, Bandera was a political terrorist who targeted Poles, when western Ukraine was part of Poland, says Andriy Portnov, a Ukrainian professor of Eastern European history at Humboldt University in Berlin. ""In the Soviet narrative, Bandera and the UPA became the anti-hero No. 1. In Ukrainian nationalism, he became the No. 1 victim of the KGB"" and was therefore lionized.Symbol of the MaidanIndeed, during the Euromaidan protests of the past year, a new myth was created about banderovtsi as heroes, with no one questioning their history, says Roman Kabachiy, a historian and journalist in Kiev.The UPAs red-and-black flag became an icon of the protest on Kievs central square last winter. Many Ukrainians still proudly hang the flag outside government buildings and schools in the west, viewing the UPA and Bandera as symbols of a fight until the bitter end bravery  despite their crimes.But in eastern Ukraine, the UPA flag and image of Bandera on the capitals main square evoked Soviet memories of World War II. Encouraged by the Russian media, easterners saw them as a sign the west was taking up the UPA's political campaign  that it was a nationalistic uprising determined to destroy the Russian-speaking population.Ukraine isnt divided by history, but by historical myths, and the UPA is a prime example of this, says Volodymyr Viatrovych, the director of Institute for National Remembrance (INR) in Kiev.'We have a common past'The best way to dispel these myths, Mr. Viatrovych says, is to create an open, national dialogue about Ukraines history.Viatrovych has been involved in such efforts in Ukraine before. Like other former Soviet republics and eastern European satellite states, Ukraine opened up its KGB archives shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union, as the country tried to come to terms with its totalitarian past. Viatrovych was the director of the archives from 2008 to 2010, but was fired in March 2010 shortly after Yanukovych became president.Access to the archives sparked public discussion for the first time in Ukrainian history about the impact of the country's famine in 1932-33. Soviet textbooks did not mention how widespread the starvation was, and generations of Ukrainians grew up only hearing whispers of stories passed down by witnesses and survivors.Viatrovych and other historians hope for similar discussion to come from programs like the mobile exhibition the INR is launching this month of historical artifacts related to anti-collectivization uprisings in 1930s' central and eastern Ukraine. The exhibit comes as the country commemorates the famine, during which 4 million people died. The exhibit will travel to eastern cities such as Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, where there is a strong negative reaction to UPA and Ukrainian nationalism.What we want to show is that these uprisings against Soviet collectivization in eastern regions like Kharkiv are similar to the UPA because they were all fighting for Ukraines freedom, Viatrovych says. We want to start those discussions to help people realize that we have a common past of fighting for freedom.This could be particularly challenging as the Ukrainian government wages a war with pro-Russia rebels in the east, who, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, question Ukraines historical statehood.Its unpopular now to say this during these very patriotic times, but I think we need to realize that Ukraine was created by different states, Mr. Kabachiy says, referring to the parts of Ukraine that were once under Austrian-Hungarian, Polish, Russian, and other rulers. We need to recognize that that is Ukraines history."

Washington  The Internet of Things encapsulates the idea that ordinary objects  from thermostats and shoes to cars and lamp posts  will be embedded with sensors and connected wirelessly to the Internet. These devices will then send and receive data which can be analyzed and acted upon. As the technology becomes cheaper and more robust, an increasing number of devices will join the Internet of Things.Though many of the changes to everyday devices may be subtle and go unnoticed by consumers, the long-term effect could ultimately have an enormously positive impact on individuals and society. A connected world is capable of anything from improving personal health to reducing pollution to making industry more productive. However, this vision of a fully connected world will not be achieved without initiative and leadership from policymakers to promote its deployment and avoid pitfalls along the way.The Center for Data Innovation hosts ""How can policymakers help build the Internet of Things?"" on Thursdayfrom 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.You can watch the event live here.

			Smart watches to fitness-tracking shirts: 5 amazing wearable gadgets
		
The potential size and scope of the Internet of Things is enormous, with the worldwide count of connected devices expected to exceed 40 billion by 2020. As technological barriers decrease and adoption of the Internet of Things takes off, how policymakers respond to this technology will be critical in determining just how many of its benefits will be realized.

Of two conflicting approaches to the Internet of Things, neither: the impose precautionary regulations nor the counter leave it completely up to the market will allow societies to gain the full benefits from this revolution. The status of the Internet of Things as an emerging technology necessitates a policy framework that is fully cognizant of its benefits, allows for future innovation, and responsibly protects against misuse without restricting its capacity to deliver social, civic, and economic benefits.There are many ways in which governments can help build the Internet of Things. On a national level, governments should develop a strategic roadmap to guide the deployment and adoption of this technology. In the US, for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development should develop an action plan to promote smart homes, and the Department of Energy should develop a plan to improve energy efficiency with connected devices.The private sector will be more likely to embrace the Internet of Things if government leaders are paving the way for deployment. At the state and local level, governments should lead by example and make smart the default for all new investments, incorporating the Internet of Things into public infrastructure projects and restructuring practices around the new capabilities of this technology.Governments can also foster growth of the Internet of Things by removing certain regulatory barriers and better aligning the overall legal framework to the needs of the technology as it develops.For example, the cumbersome review processes for low-risk medical devices can average two and a half yearsand cost a company approximately $500,000 per month. These market barriers can be enormously discouraging for entrepreneurs trying to develop potentially lifesaving technologies. In addition, with the incredible potential for the Internet of Things to collect an unprecedented amount of high quality data, regulations that increase the cost of this collection or prohibit data sharing and reuse can be damaging.There may be one primary reason to collect data, but one hundred good applications of this data beyond its initial purpose. In order to maximize the social and economic benefits of information, data users of all kinds acting in good faith should be able to share and reuse data with ease.Many technologies are often met with fear, uncertainty, and doubt, especially by those who are unfamiliar with them or opposed to change. Policymakers cannot afford to succumb to these forces if they expect to enable society to take full advantage of the Internet of Things.In particular, policymakers should be extremely cautious about regulating on the basis of purely speculative concerns that might not even come to pass, especially when doing so might curtail substantial economic and social benefits. However, policymakers should intervene promptly if specific problems arise. In doing so, they should be careful to ensure that their rulemaking targets specific, demonstrated harms. Attempting to erect precautionary regulatory barriers for purely speculative concerns is not only unproductive, but it can discourage future beneficial applications of the Internet of Things.While many of the future challenges of the Internet of Things may still be unknown, policymakers should commit to advancing this technology responsibly, rather than cripple it with unnecessary or overbearing regulations. The success of the Internet today can be credited in part to policymakers actively taking a role to ensure its growth, and this same approach should to be applied to build the Internet of Things.Daniel Castro is director of the Center for Data Innovation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institute in Washington, D.C., andand coauthor of the report ""10 Policy Principles for Unlocking the Potential of the Internet of Things."" Joshua New is a policy analyst at the center."

The Islamic State has gained ground over wide swaths of Iraq and Syria and strengthened its hold on major cities in those areas through a combination of military organization, money, and social media savvy.These are powerful tools in a new era of warfare, but the groups' strengths also have the potential to be turned around by the Pentagon in a form of strategic jiu-jitsu.Here are the top three strengths of Islamic State fighters  and how these strengths could be used against them:


By
Anna Mulrine, Staff writer

December 3, 2014 






 
1. 
The Islamic State knows how to bring in the money  and how to use it











Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen talks about actions the Treasury Department is taking to combat financing for the Islamic State group during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, Oct. 23. The Treasury Department says Islamic State militants are amassing wealth at an unprecedented pace, earning about $1 million a day from black market oil sales alone.




 Evan Vucci/AP View Caption 






The organization has shown an ability to consistently acquire substantial revenue in order to efficiently fund effective governance, warns a new Brookings Institution report, Profiling the Islamic State, which estimates the group's net worth at close to $2 billion.The Islamic State is also impressively managed and almost obsessively bureaucratic, adds the report, written by Charles Lister, who is based in Doha, Qatar. He points out that the group knows the value, too, of providing administrative and social services to civilians in areas under its control.This obsessive bureaucratic control also raises expectations, too. With this in mind, the Pentagon needs to target the transportation infrastructure used to bring oil to customers, which would have the additional benefit of cutting off key nodes of the militants' communication, as well as command and control, and upending the high expectations of service that many under Islamic State rule now have.This bureaucratic control can quickly become oppressive as well, and the Pentagons psychological operations nodes would do well to exploit these actions such as, for example, the widely unpopular Islamic State ban on birth control for the women of Mosul, one of Iraqs largest cities.

New York  When New York City announced 30 years ago that it was spending more than $50 million for buses with wheelchair lifts, Ronnie Raymond rolled her eyes. The founder of a reinsurance brokerage firm, she commuted by bus and I never saw anyone in a wheelchair, anywhere, she says. So why spend all that money?The city had already invested in 1,362 accessible buses, and only 10 to 20 people citywide a day boarded in a wheelchair.The reason I didnt see anyone in wheelchairs, Ms. Raymond later realized when she herself developed multiple sclerosis and had to use a wheelchair, was because they couldnt get anywhere. Most could not even get to the bus stop.

Today, curb cuts allow Raymond to negotiate most of Manhattan on her own. Although only 20 percent of the subway is accessible, she can board any of the citys 5,700 buses, since each is equipped to accommodate two wheelchairs. And it isnt unusual for me to have to wait for a second, or even a third bus. But, she adds, cocking her head impishly, that never bothers me. It means people in wheelchairs are getting out and doing stuff.

This is increasingly true for the estimated 37 million to 57 million Americans who have a physical, emotional, or cognitive disability. Depending on the definitions of disability applied, thats 12 to 20 percent of the US population. Globally, the United Nations estimates, 650 million people  10 percent of the world population  live with a disability, making them the worlds largest minority.There is no question that, to many with impairments, the modern world can still prove a daunting and sometimes downright inhospitable place. But nearly 25 years after President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), an increasing number in the United States are living more empowered, less restricted lives.The telecommunications infrastructure and all those man-made spaces collectively referred to as the built environment  which includes cities, architecture, transportation, even parks  are dramatically more accessible today than they were in 1990 when they passed the ADA, says Andrew Imparato, executive director of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities and former president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.Services, too, have expanded, from transit systems offering riders with disabilities free familiarization and safety programs to specialized guides at museums to a growing number of designers developing clothing with a variety of specific needs in mind.The ADA  our crowning achievement, as Mr. Imparato calls it  set the country on a new course. Those who have come of age since 1990 have grown up in more integrated settings and generally have higher expectations for what is possible for people with disabilities to achieve in work and in life than did the generations that came before them, Imparato says.Advances in technology have triggered a sea change. Mainstream innovations such as Siri double as assistive technologies, while robotics, bionics, and 3-D printers have revolutionized the design and manufacture of prostheses. And mobile phones and tablets have opened an entirely new field: apps. An ever-growing list of applications ranges from hearing aids to maps for people with low vision to communications methods for children with autism.Looking forward, experts point to another major factor in advancing quality of life: the bubble of aging baby boomers. Among people under 65, an estimated 8.5 to 14 percent have a disability. In the over-65 population, some estimates are as high as 50 percent.Just as baby boomers have set trends in everything from spending habits to dating and child rearing, boomers with disabilities are not going to scurry off to the margins of society. Theyre going to demand services and products.Many believe this will benefit society at large. At the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community, Phil Stafford talks about progress on the cultural front .... I think that those without disabilities have a kind of a taken-for-granted perspective on the world that we are shocked out of when we understand what daily barriers people might encounter.This might be an announcement some cant hear, a website others cant access, or doorknobs yet others cant grasp. The light goes on, Mr. Stafford says, when people see someone use their elbow to open a door that has a lever handle. People might say I never thought of that. Its not great world-shaking change, but its those minor encounters that make us aware.But Sharon Joines, who teaches human-centered industrial design at the North Carolina State University College of Design, doubts most would react with such empathy, pointing rather to practical benefits: When folks have a disability, they can become a burden. But if we remove barriers and provide them with the opportunity to be able to contribute with the skills that they have, then its better all the way around.Society disabled, not peopleHistorically, people with disabilities were often kept at home or in institutions, under the presumption they couldnt cope with the so-called normal world. Helen Keller upended that myth long before the ADA, and widespread shifts in attitudes began to crystallize in the 1970s. Following the model of the civil rights movement, activists lobbied and protested for the implementation of anti-discrimination provisions in the 1973 Rehabilitation Act to make the services of companies such as Greyhound accessible to people with disabilities.By the late 1980s, a new ethic began to gain currency. Rather than viewing individuals as faulty, the focus shifted to the barriers in society that kept the blind student from accessing information, the wheelchair user from going to the movies, the deaf analyst from participating in corporate meetings. In other words, society was broken and in need of fixing. The decade ended on a high, with the signing of the ADA. The law defined disability broadly, as any condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities.It was not a revolutionary law, Imparato says. It was an evolutionary law. When dealing with an existing building, he explains, you only need to make changes that are readily achievable and are not going to be crazy expensive. Anything new, on the other hand, has to be designed from the start to be accessible. So that concept, over time, produces a more accessible environment, he says.The time it can take is illustrated by the experience of author and motivational speaker Rosemarie Rossetti. In 1995, when she and her husband built their home in Columbus, Ohio, they purposefully built wider doors and a master suite on the first floor in case one of their mothers someday moved in.Three years later, Ms. Rossetti discovered how inadequate that was when a bicycle accident left her paralyzed from the waist down. She couldnt negotiate the step to the front door. Once inside, the wheels of her chair sank into the padded carpeting. Faucets were out of reach. And she lost all privacy: She could roll into the bathroom, but the layout precluded her from closing the door.After trying to shoehorn a floor plan that worked into the existing house, Rossetti and her husband, Mark Leder, started afresh. They bought land and researched universal design, which offers such solutions as pocket doors that maximize usable space for wheelchair users and suit those with limited strength, precarious balance, and hand or shoulder problems; various intensities of halogen and LED lights activated by motion sensors; non-slippery outdoor pavers; and flexibility in design that allows users to add, say, transmitters that translate doorbells, a babys cry, the beep of a smoke alarm into flashing lights or vibrations in a pillow.They decided to create a home that would accommodate both the seated Rossetti and her 6-foot-4 husband and serve as a model for students, professionals, and the public at large. With the help of corporate sponsors, they built the Universal Design Living Laboratory, a 3,500-square-foot ranch house as green as it is accessible and attractive. A gently sloping entryway leads into a spacious home with hardwood floors and wide doorways, kitchen counters of various heights, roll-in showers with high and low shelves, and such features as sinks with nothing below them and oven doors that swing sideways so Rossetti can move in close. Ive gone from frustration to freedom, from dependence to independence, from pain to no pain, psychologically, physically, emotionally, she says.Ignorance of disabilities isnt a cruel mind-setOne reason universal design has not caught on more widely is that baby boomers, the contemporary engine of change, tend to assume they will be spared any age-related decline. Theyre in denial, says Michael Thomas of the Design Collective Group in Palm Springs, Calif. For years he has advocated an aging in place approach to building and remodeling, but now uses a neutral slogan: Stay in Place. This is exactly what 91 percent of Americans say they want to do, according to a recent survey by the Global Social Enterprise Initiative at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and the Philips company. While 96 percent say it is important to remain as independent as possible as they age, only 21 percent plan to retrofit their homes to help achieve this goal.With boomers, Mr. Thomas invokes resale value, visits by older relatives and friends, or the possibility that a child, even a grandchild, might use crutches for a spell. Basically, he talks about everything exceptthem when suggesting boomer clients align closets between floors so they might later add an elevator or install plywood behind bathroom walls to anchor future balance bars. These things benefit older people as well as people with disabilities, and, deny it as they might, boomers will create a surge in demand. The same principles apply to cyberspace, where people shop, meet, and work. As with bricks and mortar construction, its cheaper and more efficient to make programs and websites accessible from the start. Not that absolutely everybodys needs can be met, says Shawn Henry, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who focuses on Web accessibility for the World Wide Web Consortium known as W3C. But, she says, you can make it flexible, which is much easier to do on the Web than on earth. With a click of a button, users can access closed captioning; change font sizes or contrast; switch controls to a keyboard, puffer, or eye movement tracker; or activate a screen reader or Braille display.People accessing the Web on mobile devices have helped our case, Ms. Henry adds. Sites that convey information solely through color, rely on audio prompts, or include long, complex sentences, for example, dont work well on smart phones. These devices often have a limited range of color, and their size makes it difficult to wade through dense texts, stymieing users with and without disabilities. Plus, users often go online in noisy places. This helps explain why a 2003 Microsoft study found that the majority of working-age adults were likely to benefit from accessible technology.But it first has to become widely available. A 2012 study indicates that most public library websites still do not comply with the accessibility standards required of government-funded institutions. The situation is worse among commercial websites. Less than 5 percent of online shopping sites meet the needs of people with disabilities, estimates Brian Landrigan, head of sales and marketing for the Paciello Group, which specializes in software accessibility. Most employers say they cannot find candidates with disabilities who have the right education and skills. But, says Mr. Landrigan, no company has asked him to ensure its online job applications are accessible. They simply dont have any experience with a person with a disability, he says. Its not a cruel mind-set. Its ignorance. A need is a profit opportunityLike many Americans who have a disability, Ronnie Raymond has horror stories: Being left stranded by taxi drivers because theyre unwilling or not equipped to deal with her wheelchair; going to a doctors appointment and finding herself stuck at the top of steps, relegated to a closet-like space for treatment, or treated as a nuisance when she couldnt leave her wheelchair for a better perch for tests or screenings; having fellow shareholders in her cooperative apartment building refuse to build a ramp even after she offered to pay for it.Even so, Raymond has seen tremendous change. When the courts sided with her in January 1999, the co-op added a ramp that blends with the architecture. After arriving at the doctors office recently to get a mammogram, Raymond followed the technician to a spacious room with a machine designed for standing or seated patients. The process, which five years ago lasted three hours and left her in tears, now takes less than an hour and includes no humiliations. And, thanks in part to Raymonds own activism, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission announced in December 2013 that 50 percent of its medallion cabs will be wheelchair accessible by 2020.Change has come largely from litigation. As important as the ADA has been, says Stafford, at the Indiana institute, its building for accessibility rather than building for everybody, so the law extends its reach through individuals charging discrimination or the fear that this might happen.But not all improvements are mandated. The Red Lobster chain of restaurants, for example, did not introduce Braille and large-print menus in 2002 because it was legally required to. It isnt. A staff member who was blind in one eye proposed the idea.For others, Ms. Joines says, Heck, thats market share and [they] want the market share, right? In a very competitive environment, people are interested in creating something that can be used by and is attractive to more people.The chief executive officer of Star Transportation Group in Pittsburgh had just such an idea. The citys Yellow Cab company had no accessible vehicles so, in 2010, Robert DeLucia bought a fleet of MV-1s, the only US-made vehicle designed from the ground up to meet ADA requirements, and recruited drivers who are veterans or directly related to veterans. He converted the vehicles to run on compressed natural gas. Because powered wheelchairs can add 500 pounds to an already heavy vehicle, the decision proved ecologically and financially sound because it reduces fuel and consumption costs.When former marine James Stanley pulls up to the Westin Hotel in a van with a red-and-blue VetTaxi logo, he slides out the ramp and, within a couple of minutes, has secured a passengers wheelchair up front with the driver. The demonstration is impressive and in sharp contrast to the experience of using retrofitted cabs in which the passenger rolls in through the rear, facing backward.Describing her own experience riding in an MV-1, Raymond enthused, I felt I didnt have to apologize for who I am.A kid who wants to play regular sportsA month into his summer vacation this year, 13-year-old Chris Tavarez and his mom drove to Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., 20 minutes from their home on Long Island. He was embarking on his first sleepaway camp, and when they got there, it wasnt clear his mother would actually let go of her boy. Youre scared, Maria Tavarez later confessed. Will he get hurt?On the second full day of camp, the only thing that pegged the skinny, wisecracking kid as a first-timer was a slight diffidence when he ran, and a valiant effort to mask embarrassment when he would hit the baseball tee. That, and his surprise at having to wear a blindfold: Man, I cant see anything, he deadpanned. One of the coaches chuckled, and Chris, too, grinned. This is Camp Abilities, after all, a nationwide organization for kids with a range of visual impairments. Blindfolds level the playing field.Chris, who can see only out of one eye and very dimly at that, cocked his bat and, all ears, focused on the balls electronic beep-beep. He slammed his bat into the batting tee. I broke [it] again, he said, head lowered. The next time, though, he thwacked the beeping ball, and his expression sharpened. Did it go far?Over four days, Chris swam, rode tandem bikes, wrestled, and played three team sports. In each, the coaches began by passing around a tactile map of the field or court, exploring the area with the athletes, and introducing them to the games auditory cues. For many Camp Abilities kids, this was the first time they played sports with peers. Half had either no physical education at all during school or, like Chris, took it apart from classmates. Its just me, my teacher, and my aide, he says.Thats such a disservice, says Lauren Lieberman, who cofounded Camp Abilities, because part of physical education is the camaraderie and the socialization and teamwork.She also points to the fear of letting kids with disabilities take risks: Sometimes the child is going to fall down. A lot of the kids I work with say, I have the right to be in a situation where I am pushing myself like everybody else. Opportunities to do this are increasing, says Peg Smith, chief executive officer of the American Camp Association: In the last two decades, Ive seen the number and scope of programs grow as part of a more general trend toward inclusion. About half of ACAs 3,000 member camps now accept and work with kids with special needs.The belief underlying such programs is that everyone has the right to discover their strengths and find ways with which to engage in the community at large. In many respects, this is the foundation of what is referred to as disability pride, which, as Imparato explains, is not unlike gay pride or being a feminist or proud of being an Italian-American or of being from Arkansas. Its a part of who you are that you are not ashamed of. It is empowering, he says, and the key to building a better future.On the last day of Camp Abilities, kids show off for their parents, herding them from the bikes to the wrestling mat to the baseball field with its beeping balls and bases. When they leave, they take with them new confidence and independence, friendships, and a sense of possibility in the form of a thick envelope that includes a progress report for their PE teachers along with a description of the sports they engaged in and any modifications used. These can be as simple as choosing a ball with a color that stands out against the gym floor, ordering equipment with a sound component, training a teachers aide to act as a guide, or tweaking the rules so the entire class can play a game.I want to have regular classes with the regular kids, Chris says, and play regular sports with them. For the first time, he thinks this could actually happen.Empathy grows with awarenessA competitive diver, Manjushree Sen had no reason to think that, by the time she turned 50, shed be tethered to an oxygen tank and require a continuous infusion of medications to keep breathing. For many years after her 1994 diagnosis of a lung disease, she says, nobody would have guessed I was disabled. She was just a woman who sometimes paused to catch her breath.In 2002 she was hired by SRA International Inc., a government contractor. As her condition worsened, her supervisor directed her to SRAs Well Within unit, which handles health and accommodation issues, from providing temporary scooters or speech-recognition software to engaging teletyping services and sign language interpretation, says manager Kate Valette. When Ms. Sens condition precluded her from getting to the office, the company devised a telecommuting alternative. For the past four years, Sen has been confined to her condo, where she processes refugee requests from embassies around the world. A single mother of a now-20-year-old son, she says she feels very fortunate to be earning a full salary and not going crazy while stuck at home. Sen had a double-lung transplant last summer and will soon resume working, first at home, and eventually in the office.Sen is in the minority. Less than a third of people with disabilities have a job, according to the Research and Training Center on Disability Statistics and Demographics.Research on employers by the Employment and Disability Institute at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., places SRA among the 19 percent of companies that have a fund earmarked for accommodations. Cornell researchers also found that most companies did not include people with disabilities when thinking about building a diverse workforce. The words appear in nondiscrimination clauses, but only 19 percent have internships targeting people with disabilities.Disability advocates hope that legislation President Obama signed in July will help bring more young people with disabilities into the labor force. Employment, they argue, is key to raising 28 percent of working-age adults with disabilities out of poverty and tearing down remaining barriers.For Imparato, its a bellwether. An increase will signal that education, transportation, health care, technology  all the systems necessary for people to hold a job  are functioning. And as more people work together, attitudes will change.Landrigan already sees this happening when he meets with clients and walks them through their websites, pointing out who they are excluding and how.Their reaction? I would say its empathy."

Washington  To Pentagon officials, the survey on sexual assault in the military released Thursday is full of signs of progress.Reports of sexual assault are on the rise, which suggests that more victims are comfortable coming forward, they say. Indeed, 1 in 4 victims chose to report their claims of sexual assault this year, up from 1 in 10 two years ago, the survey suggests.To Jennifer Brier, however, these positive trends are not the full story. There is another statistic that is just as poignant: 62 percent of the women who reported a sexual assault said that they experienced some kind of retaliation, with most perceiving social retaliation from co-workers or peers, according to the study.

Ms. Brier, a retired Marine staff sergeant, can relate to that intimately. She spent 10 years in the military without ever reporting the senior non-commissioned officer who she says sexually assaulted her when she was a teen just out of basic training.

Another former Marine, Anu Bhagwati, sees a Pentagon that has taken needed steps to support victims who come forward but has done little to change a justice system that at times seems stacked against them.They are just two voices of former service members, but they point to silent voices within the Pentagon who laud the change afoot but see how much work remains to be done before they are viewed as truly equal colleagues in uniform.That process begins, the two women say, with holding the perpetrators of sexual crimes to account.The [Department of Defense] has done a very good job of supporting victims through services, which is fantastic, but very little has been done to improve the quality of the judicial system, says Ms. Bhagwati, who is now the executive director of the Service Womens Action Network.The system involves rules that give commanders the authority not only personally to choose jurors but also to overturn a judge's sentence. The Military Justice Improvement Act, a bill introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) of New York, would take responsibility for prosecuting sexual assaults away from commanders and put it into the hands of independent prosecutors. But a similar measure was defeated in the Senate amid the protests by Pentagon officials, who argued that it would remove key authorities from commanders.Within hours after the release of the report Thursday, advocacy groups renewed their calls for the Senate to pass the Gillibrand bill.When Brier looks back on her experience, she says it did not even occur to her to report her attacker. She had just turned 18 and was assaulted after being posted to Okinawa, where she was very, very new on base. Around the same time, she witnessed significant retaliation against a fellow sexual assault victim and did not want to share her fate.Today, after a military career that ran from 1994 to 2004, she has told her story to some fellow Marines. But their responses, while sympathetic, only make her feel worse, she says. Consistently, the message that I get is, I never thought that [sexual assault] would happen to a girl like you,  she says. They think what they were saying was supportive, but it is like a gut punch. What kind of girl does that happen to? she asks.Ironically, comments like those only make her more convinced that her decision to stay silent  while wrenching  was the right one, given the culture of the military.Had I come forward at the time, I dont think they would have gotten to know me as the woman I am, because I would have been flagged as one of those girls. The bottom line, she says, is that even though these are people that are wonderful professionals who respect me, theres still that undercurrent of victim blaming.Thursday's survey suggests that undercurrent remains and continues to contribute to high rates of retaliation, adds Brier, who is now a counselor for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).Today, she sees evidence of the same culture in her current job. Around the halls of the VA, it is far more common to hear fellow veteran care providers accuse female rape victims of working the system for post-traumatic stress treatment than it is to hear male combat veterans accused of doing the same thing for their post-traumatic stress claims, she says.And while she is heartened by the increases in those willing to come forward to report sexual crimes, Brier believes it is essential that perpetrators are punished through a reformed military justice system.One important step has been a law passed last year making it a punishable offense to retaliate against a victim of sexual assault. The interesting thing, Bhagwati says, will be to see if anybody gets charged with it."

In 2013 alone, 133 people in Japan died from suicide or health-related issues attributed to being overworked. The law ... requires the government to implement public-enlightenment programs about the risks of overwork, establish counseling systems and provide support for nongovernmental organizations dealing with the issue.... The business community, which has called for deregulation of the work-hour rules, is opposed to the introduction of a uniform cap on the maximum work hours including overtime. But the key to eliminating death from overwork will be efforts to curb the long working hours of many corporate workers.

				Those hoping to give their true love a few turtle doves or French hens for Christmas will have to shell out extra this year.Financial firm PNC Wealth Management has once again released its annual Christmas Price Index (CPI), not to be confused with the consumer price index. The CPIcalculates the monetary value of all the items listed in the 12 Days of Christmas carol. A partridge in a pear tree, for example, will set you back $207.68 this year  $20 for the partridge, and $187.68 for the pear tree, a 3.8 percent increase over last year. Housing and fresh fruit prices have been up recently, the report explains. Overall, prices were relatively stable year-over-year. A full set of the gifts (one partridge, two turtle doves, three hens, and so on) would cost $27,673.21 in stores, a 1 percent increase over 2013. Purchasing all items each time they are mentioned in the song  364 gifts in total  would cost $116,273, a 1.4 percent increase over last year. Even swans a swimming, historically the indexs most volatile category (so much so that PWC also calculates a core index that excludes the swans category) went unchanged from 2013.

PNC began tracking the Christmas cost index in 1984, it says, in part to keep its investors entertained during the slow holiday months. Since then, the CPI has increased 118 percent, while overall inflation has risen 127 percent. While there are exceptions in given years, whats most interesting about the indexs history is that since the beginning, year-over-year increases have averaged 2.8 percent, which is exactly the same number as the US inflation index, Jim Dunigan, PNCs chief financial officer, said in the release.The index, of course, is more a fun diversion than anything else, but the research behind it is still exhaustive and diligent. Prices are culled from a wide array of sources, like the National Aviary of Pittsburgh (for doves and swans), the Pennsylvania Ballet company (nine ladies dancing), a plant nursery (for the pear tree) and a national jewelry chain (for the five golden rings).Despite its limited scope, the CPI can tell us a lot about the dynamics of the overall economy. Food prices (including poultry) have been on the rise this year, but stagnation in energy and labor prices have kept overall consumer costs relatively flat. Of the gifts in the carol that require human labor, only ten lords a leaping saw a price increase.

				As it moved forward on backlogged nominations yesterday, the Senate approved the nomination of Colleen Bell to be the next US ambassador to Hungary, and that didnt make Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona happy at all:
The Senate confirmed a producer of the soap opera The Bold and The Beautiful today to serve as ambassador to Hungary, and Sen. John McCain is not happy about it.
Prior to the vote, McCain, R-Ariz., went on a tirade about how Colleen Bradley Bell, a soap opera producer and bundler for President Obamas campaigns, is unqualified to represent the United States as an ambassador to Hungary.
Were about to vote on a totally unqualified individual to be ambassador to a nation which is very important to our national security interest, McCain said on the Senate floor. Her qualifications are as a producer of the television soap opera The Bold and The Beautiful, contributed 800,000 [dollars] to Obama in the last election and bundled more than $2.1 million for President Obamas re-election effort.
I am not against political appointees  I understand how the game is played, but here we are, a nation [Hungary] that is on the verge of ceding its sovereignty to a neo-fascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin and were going to send the producer of The Bold and The Beautiful as the ambassador, McCain continued. I urge my colleagues to put a stop to this foolishness. I urge a no vote.
Regardless of McCains urging, the Senate confirmed Bell to the ambassador post with a vote of 52-42.
McCains displeasure with Bells qualifications stems from a contentious confirmation hearing earlier this year when multiple ambassador nominees bungled questions from senators. In her questioning with McCain, Bell struggled to name the U.S. strategic interests in Hungary. Heres an excerpt from the hearing:
MCCAIN: So what would you be doing differently from your predecessor, who obviously had very rocky relations with the present government?
BELL: If confirmed, I look forward to working with the broad range of society 
MCCAIN: My question was, what would you do differently?
BELL: Senator, in terms of what I would do differently from my predecessor, Kounalakis 
MCCAIN: Thats the question.
BELL: Well, what I would like to do when  if confirmed  I would like to work towards engaging civil society in a deeper  in a deeper 
MCCAIN: Obviously, you dont want to answer my question.
If anything good can be said about Bells response here, it is that at least she didnt struggle with having to respond about the last time she had actually visited the nation that she would be serving as the diplomatic face of the United States, like the proposed ambassador to Argentina did earlier this year.The White House, meanwhile, seemed to struggle to explain just how Bell is qualified to serve in the position she has not been confirmed to:

Its not every day that White House has to defend its decision to nominate a soap opera producer to represent the country on one of the highest diplomatic levels.
But it was that kind of Tuesday.
Asked at the daily press briefing what makes The Bold and The Beautiful producer Colleen Bell qualified to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary, White House spokesman Josh Earnest didnt exactly have an explanation.
(Shes) somebody who obviously has succeeded in, you know, in the business world, Earnest said.
And she is somebody that the President has confidence will be able to maintain our relationship with the government and the people of Hungary.
Earnest also denied that Bells hand in raising millions of dollars for the Presidents re-election campaign had anything to do with her appointment.
Well, I can tell you that thats not the reason she was chosen, he said.
Earnest said the reason Bell was nominated for the post was because the President has complete confidence in her ability to represent the United States in that country.

The truth, of course, is that Bells appointment is just another example of a very old game in Washington in which campaign donors and friends of the president end up getting rewarded with largely symbolic positions on government commissions or appointments to ambassadorial positions, usually in countries that are not among the more important when it comes to world affairs. Not surprisingly, these end up being nations where the duties of the ambassador end up being largely ceremonial and US relations with the country in question are sufficiently solid that sending what amounts to a symbolic appointment to be the nations chief diplomatic representative would not be seen as an insult.A quick Google search this morning, for example, yielded some interesting results from the American Foreign Service Association, which has cataloged every ambassadorial appointment from President Gerald Ford through President Obama (to date, obviously) and grouped those appointments into career appointments, meaning that the appointee came from within the career foreign service and political which they means they came from outside, and found this:

President Ford made 97 appointments during his brief time in office, 60 (61.9 percent) of which were career appointments and 37 (38.2 percent) of which were political;

President Carter made 202 appointments during his four years in office, 148 (73.27 percent) of them career appointments, and 54 (26.73 percent) of them political;

President Reagan made 420 appointments over eight years, 261 (62 percent) of them career appointments, and 159 (38 percent) political appointments;

President George H.W. Bush made 214 appointments in four years, 147 (68.69 percent) of them career appointments, and 67 (31.30 percent) political appointments;

President Clinton made 417 appointments over eight years, 300 (71.94 percent) of them career appointments, and 117 (28.06 percent) political appointments;

President George W. Bush made 453 appointments in his eight years in office, 318 (70.2 percent) of them career appointments, and 135 (28.9 percent) political appointments; and finally,

President Obama has, to date, made 378 appointments since 2009, 245 (64.8 percent) of them career appointments, and 133 (35.2 percent) political appointments
On average, these numbers show that presidential ambassadorial appointments have come from the career foreign service roughly 67.54 percent of the time and from political appointments roughly 32.54 percent of the time. Among presidents who have served a full eight years in office, the average has been 68.05 percent career appointees and 31.95 percent political appointees. Not all of these political appointees have been donors or buddies of the president, of course, but many of them have.The US ambassador to Mexico during much of the Reagan administration, for example, was John Gavin, a former Hollywood actor who was close to Reagan personally. The US ambassador to the Bahamas during a good portion of the Clinton Administration was Sidney Williams, a former professional football player who also happens to be the husband of Rep. Maxine Waters. The ambassador to Belize during George W. Bushs second term was Robert Dieter, the presidents former roommate at Yale. So, yes, Bells appointment to the ambassadorship in Hungary is political, but thats not unusual given recent history and Obamas political vs. career appointment ratio isnt all that different from the recent historical norm.On some level, I suppose, one can lament the fact that any of these ambassadorships are being handed out for political reasons, but this is, for better or worse how things have always been done and it doesnt really seem to have had any impact on how foreign policy is conducted. One reason this is the case is that, by and large, a look at the lists Ive linked above shows that the appointments to nations that would have been considered important at the given time were almost exclusively from among the career foreign service.This makes sense because, to the extent the pool of such candidates is limited, youd want to use them on the nations where a direct relationship between the ambassador and the people in charge is important, or where it calls for someone who can navigate diplomatic minefield. In other parts of the world, where the ambassador is as much a goodwill face of the nation and someone who exists to promote good relations and trade, much of those duties can be carried out at the sub-ambassadorial level, where the positions are indeed filled with people with foreign service experience.Additionally, now that we live in a world of near instant communications where the president, White House chief of staff, secretary of State, or any other official can be put in contact with their counterpart anywhere in the world with relative ease, the role of the ambassador has changed significantly from the what it was in the days of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, or even from what it was in more recent decades. When officials in Washington can largely get in contact with whomever they need to whenever they want, the role of the person representing the nation in the capital city of another nation is naturally going to become far less diplomatic in the formal sense, and far more akin to the role of a cultural, trade, and tourism ambassador.This, along with the the tremendous goodwill that the Japanese people still have for John F. Kennedy, for example, is a good reason why Caroline Kennedys appointment as ambassador to Japan a few years back was not very surprising. Japan remains an important ally, of course, but the role of the ambassador has changed given modern technology and all of the other ties between Washington and Tokyo.Thats not to say that technology has made ambassadors superfluous, of course, but things have changed enough that we may start to see more political appointments in the future than we have in the past. After all, if ambassador is basically just becoming a symbolic position, then its far less important to have experienced diplomats fill those roles.Doug Mataconis appears on the Outside the Beltway blog at http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/."

				Feeling rather alone in the world these days, like a schoolyard bully who suddenly finds himself friendless, Russia is now singing a song of economic self-reliance. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin asked Russians to depend more on their own goods and to create their own businesses.We should wipe the critical dependence on foreign technologies and industrial production, he said in his annual state ofthe union message. The main thing we need to understand is that our development depends on ourselves first and foremost.The new inwardness is partly a result of Western sanctions on Russia for taking Crimea as well as a drastic drop in the global price of Russias main export, oil. Inflation is now nearly 10 percent. The economy may be in recession next year. And more Russians are fleeing the country than ever.Yet Mr. Putins drive for more economic independence may also be a way to restore patriotism and an identity centered on his notion of Russian civilization. He points to the West for what not to do:

If for some European countries national pride is a long-forgotten concept and sovereignty is too much of a luxury, true sovereignty for Russia is absolutely necessary for survival, he said. Russia must be sovereign, he adds, or we dissolve without a trace and lose our identity.Putin now plans to support entrepreneurs who can supplant foreign goods or services. Rather than remain dependent on the foreign banking system, he plans a national payment system like that in China. His government has already cut off imports of many food staples from the West and has warned Russians against traveling abroad. Many state employees are banned from leaving the country. And global access to the Internet is now tightly controlled.For nearly a quarter century, ever since the collapse of the Soviet empire, Russia has embraced global markets, even joining the World Trade Organization in 2012. But if it now returns to a form of autarchy (economic self-reliance), it risks becoming more like North Korea  proud and stable, yes, but weaker, fearful, and perhaps dangerous.Russia does not have a strong history of entrepreneurship, given its long dependence on government to run the economy. A poll by the Russian Academy of Sciences found that more than half the middle class were employed by the state. Small andmid-size businesses are only about a fifth of the economy, far less than in other wealthy countries. Yet Russia can surely do better at creating value from its abundant resources and the natural talents and creativity of its people. It is well-known, for example, in producing software geniuses.This should not be done, however, out of national pride or fear of imagined foes. The history of prosperity and freedom in the world is built on mutual dependence between nations, as Germany and Japan discovered after World War II. National greatness can be built on sharing and cooperation.Russia has certainly violated international norms in Ukraine. But it is not a permanent pariah. A nation of 144 million people spread across 11 time zones can hardly pull up the economic drawbridge."

				An old bit of wisdom  that gambling is only for people who never took math  may have finally hit home with Americans. According to surveys by researchers at the University at Buffalo, the number of gamblers and the frequency of their play have dropped since 1999 despite a recent proliferation of casinos and lotteries. Even more heartening, the largest falloff was among people under age 30 (from 89 percent to 78 percent).Unlike their elders, perhaps the younger generation knows the odds are never in their favor when they are up against the Hunger Games-like gambling industry. Or perhaps the thrill is gone with so many more gambling joints now an easy drive away for most Americans  or just a click away in many places.The survey, published in the Journal of Gambling Studies, did find hard-core gamblers are betting more money and that Internet gambling has gone up. But policymakers  who generally promote gambling  should take note of the decline in interest among young people. For one, they still gamble far more often then their parents, despite the greater decline. Two, they are more prone to become problem gamblers. And three, the industry is now targeting that group with heavier promotion, especially to woo them off gaming on home electronic devices.In a number of countries, including the United States, officials are trying harder to coax the industry not to advertise to adolescents. Governments also demand that casinos not allow underage people to enter. Officials also worry that software aimed at keeping children out of adult-only Internet gambling websites may not be effective.

With this trend of young people away from gambling, government should start to question its support of the industry (and its addiction to tax revenue from gambling). A recent statement from the group Stop Predatory Gambling sums up the best reasons to end government support:We mock the higher values that any good society depends on  honesty, mutual trust, self-discipline, sacrifice, concern for others, and a belief in a work ethic that connects effort and reward  when government tells its citizens every day that it is committed to providing fun instead of opportunity; that a rigged bet is the way to achieve the American dream; and that spending ones hard-earned dollars on scratch tickets is a form of good citizenship."

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA   Small and thin, his head hunched, Chester Missing listened wide-eyed to the man laying out the legal charges against him  defamation, harassment, inciting death threats.Then again, wide-eyed is just about the only look Chester Missing is capable of  because Chester Missing is a South African puppet.But that detail mattered little to the team of lawyers who gathered in Johannesburg last week to defend his right to lob robust criticism at a prominent right-wing musician. Nor did it appear important to the white-separatist activist delivering an impassioned plea for Chester to be legally silenced.

From a recent human rights probe about a popular township rap song demanding South African Indians ""go back across the ocean"" to recurrent debates within universities on whether to punish white students for dressing in blackface at on-campus parties, the question of what boundaries should be set around hateful racial comments is constantly churning here. This case foregrounds a much deeper, under-the-skin problem in South Africa, says Dale McKinley, an activist and spokesperson for the Right2Know Campaign, a free speech group. It reminds people that much of the so-called process of reconciliation that happened here in the 1990s was quite surface level, and beneath it are many whites who still harbor very racist attitudes that dont often make it into the public conversation.""It all started with a tweetThe spat that brought Chester Missing  and his human handler, the ventriloquist Conrad Koch  to the Johannesburg court began in late October with a single tweet.Sorry to offend but in my books Blacks were the architects of Apartheid. Go figure,"" wrote singer Steve Hofmeyr to his 125,000 followers onOct. 23. By way of clarification, Mr. Hofmeyr  who moonlights as an advocate for a white separatist state  quickly explained he meant that South Africas rigid system of segregation had been a necessary wayof institutionalis[ing] a little distance between racial groups that couldnt get along.If folk did not want to share a country with you,why is it always their fault? he wrote in an explanatory post on Facebook. If there has hardly been a prosperous black-led country, it isnt always other peoples fault.Enter Chester Missing piloted by Mr. Koch,who is famous for Stephen Colbert-styleinterviews with South Africas political heavyweights on a popular comedic newscast, Late Night News.Within hours of the original tweet he had taken to his own feed with a stream of vitriol against Hofmeyr, calling him thevoice for a privileged, self-righteous community of bigots and demanding that sponsors of events at which the singer was scheduled to appear immediately withdraw their support.A week later, Hofmeyr shot back, winning a temporary protection order against puppet and handler, saying their tweets constituted harassment and had subjected the singer to numerous threats against his life.Suddenly, a Twitter spat had become an interrogation of South Africas free speech laws, and soon the countrys most prominent freedom of speech lawyers jumped into the fray.Criticism of a public figure's controversial statements about apartheid is protected speech, and far from harassment, constitutes speech that is important in our democracy, says Dario Milo, a partner at the Johannesburg-based firm Webber Wentzel, which routinely defends journalists and media outlets and was a member of Chester Missings legal team.While the Harassment Act can be used to stop truly harassing electronic communications, it was an abuse of the legislation to seek a  protection order in circumstances where what was happening was a critic was being silenced, Mr. Milo says.'Down with racism'Chester Missing wasnt ready to go down without a fight. And on Nov. 27 he headed to court.Chester is looking ready. He had his head waxed, has a tie on and even borrowed clothes from his friend Pinocchio, Koch explained to a reporter outside the court.Once inside, he listened quietly as activist Dan Roodt, speaking on behalf of Hofmeyr, explained that,Steve is a member of the minority which is suffering extreme violence in this country.Ultimately, however, magistrateNaren Sewnarainroundly dismissed the notion that the puppet was guilty of hate speech, and summarily lifted the gag order.But the two sides werent three steps out of the courtroom before their debate began again in earnest.You can defame us all you like, we [the Afrikaners] are here to stay, Roodt said, swatting the puppet as Chester bobbled behind him towards the courts exit,screaming phansi, racism, phansi!(Down with racism, down!)As Roodt brushed past him and out of the building, the puppet retreated, but not before someone in the crowd shouted out the classic call-and-response of anti-apartheid protestors: Amandla!(Power!)Awethu! returned the crowd vigorously to us!as Chester Missing slipped quietly out of view."

				A few days ago, an Egyptian judge tossed out a conviction against former dictator Hosni Mubarak that had found him responsible for the deaths of 11 protesters as he clung to power in early 2011, on rather odd procedural reasoning.Yesterday, another Egyptian judge sentenced 188 people to death for participating in an Aug. 14, 2013 riot that saw a police station near Cairo sacked and 14 people die, most of them Egyptian police. That riot was sparked by a crackdown on protesters the same day that left at least 817 people dead and, in the words of Human Rights Watch, ""probably amounts to crimes against humanity"" and was ""one of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history.""No one has been charged in the 817 deaths, which occurred as military and police dispersed an encampment of the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters in Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. The protesters were calling for a reversal of the coup that had returned the military to power a month earlier.

Egypt's courts pride themselves on what they claim is their independence from political interference and commitment to evenhandedness. But over the past year, they have reasserted themselves as fierce protectors of state power, and as tools for muzzling dissenters. The Rabaa massacre was in many ways the end of the beginning for the military's return to dominance, and was followed by mass arrests of almost the entire top leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, whose Mohamed Morsi had won Egypt's first free presidential election in 2012.

Two developments followed: the election of retired Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, head of the junta that ousted Mr. Morsi, to the presidency earlier this year; and an ongoing process of dismantling competing political movements, be they secular-leaning or Islamist. It is hard to look at recent rulings in Egypt and not conclude that the impunity for abuses by security forces that reigned in the Mubarak years  and created the fury that led to the 2011 uprising  is back in force.Nagy Shehata, the judge who condemned 188 to death yesterday, also presided over the farcical trial of three Al Jazeera English journalists: Egyptian Baher Mohamed, Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy, and Australian Peter Greste. All three were sentenced to seven years in jail last June. The ""evidence"" consisted of assertions that they were in league with the Muslim Brotherhood and terrorists to damage Egypt. In a written explanation of his verdict, Mr. Shehata said the three men has been ""encouraged by the devil to use journalism against this nation.""The men still languish in prison. While almost any journalist working in Egypt at that time would have had ""links"" to the Muslim Brotherhood (when I worked in the country, my cellphone was filled with numbers for their spokesmen and senior officials), that wasn't even a legitimate argument in the case of Mr. Greste  a Kenya-based correspondent who was in Egypt on temporary assignment.In November, Egypt's lawyers union accused Shehata in a statement of ""terrorizing"" the defense attorneys for left-leaning political activist Ahmed Douma. The judge had referred five of the six-member team to prosecutors for investigation for not showing him due respect. He then referred the union for investigation for its statement.The Mubarak judgeThe judge who tossed out the Mubarak case was Mahmoud Kamel al-Rashidi. His reasoning: Since Mubarak was added to the list of accused suspects in the killings of protesters two months after charges were first filed against others, prosecutors had madean implied decision that there were no grounds for criminal proceedings""(in the translation of Egyptian lawyer and rights activist Hossam Baghat). That's legal reasoning a yoga instructor could be proud of. For good measure, he also acquitted the Mubarak officials who'd originally been part of the case, including then-Interior Minister Habib al-Adly.Mr. Rashidi wasn't exactly coy about his motivations.In his ruling, he wrote that the 2011 uprising was part of a vast ""international, American, Hebrew conspiracy"" that aims to break large Arab nations into smaller ones and thereby secure the future of Israel. He said that the instruments of this conspiracy (which he called an ""Axis of Evil,"" borrowing President George W. Bush's famous phrase) include Al Qaeda, the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Qatar (a staunch backer of Egypt's now-outlawed Brotherhood), Iran, and Hamas, among others.Rashidi writes that agents of the conspiracy infiltrated the 2011 protests with hidden weapons, forcing security forces to fire in self-defense. His reasons for this belief? The past statements to the same effect of Mubarak's former vice president and intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman (since deceased), and Mubarak's former Defense Minister Hussein Tantawy, among others.No criticism from the USThe US State Department has resolutely refused to criticize the dismissal of the charges against Mubarak, or more generally to comment meaningfully on Egypt's courts. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, pressed for a US response to Mubarak's acquittal, twice repeated that ""we continue to believe that upholding impartial standards of accountability will advance the political consensus on which Egypts long-term stability and economic growth depends."" Ms. Psaki said further questions about the Mubarak verdict or the quality of the Egyptian judiciary should be directed to Egyptian officials.Yesterday, Psaki was slightly more forthcoming. While refusing to comment on the Mubarak case, she said: ""We have, throughout many, many months, raised very many concerns about the Egyptian judicial processes, including when they sentenced a huge  hundreds of people to death sentences.""For now, the Obama administration continues to stand four-square behind President Sisi and Egypt. As Obama said in September ahead of a meeting with Sisi in New York: ""The US-Egyptian relationship has been an important cornerstone of our security policy and our policy in the Middle East for a very long time. This is our first opportunity face-to-face to discuss a wide range of issues -- everything from the Palestinian-Israeli situation in Gaza, to Libya, to the issues of [the Islamic State], Iraq, and Syria."" In June, the US released partially frozen US military aid, just before the Al Jazeera verdicts. In September, the US said 10 Apache attack helicopters would soon be delivered to the country."

				A persons past is the only clue most of us have to go on, especially when we take a leap of faith and put our trust in them. So we ask about their lives  where they came from, what influenced them. Employers pore over rsums and tap references from former bosses, trying to make a right choice about a new hire. Companionship-seekers pay close attention to their dates back story to better understand what they might be getting themselves into. Large portions of the educational-industrial complex are devoted to the study of great men and women in the hopes that only the good parts of history will repeat themselves.Take, for example, this Monitor profile of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R) of Kentucky (click here to read it). Over the past few years, the Monitor has profiled former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) of California, Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio, President Obama, and world leaders such as Russias Vladimir Putin. A profile is a biography with news in its nose cone, an examination of what makes a prominent person tick.The aim is to try to foretell how future policy decisions will unfold. Was there something in ancestry or childhood  a mentor, a triumph, a close shave  that can unlock the secret to what he or she might do? Did Anwar Sadats Sudanese grandmother influence his boldness in Egypts 1973 war with Israel and his even bolder peacemaking afterward? Can the pivotal point in Nelson Mandelas life be found in his Xhosa culture, his time spent in an Anglo school or Robben Island prison, or his mastery of boxing and ballroom dancing?Most lives are erected brick by brick. Character is an edifice, not an anecdote, and even strongly defined characters can surprise us. Mr. McConnells Senate might find ways to make deals across the aisle and with the White House. Hes led along those lines before. Or he could see his purpose as holding the Obama administration in check while championing a party-first agenda. Hes been there, too. Francine Kiefers profile explores the possibilities.

In a useful profile like Francines, showing is better than telling. A persons words are important, but actions speak louder. If that were not the case, the great English-language wordsmith William Shakespeare wouldnt himself be a mystery. His vivid portraits of the mighty, the foolish, and the tragic who have strutted and fretted on historys stage constitute what many of us think we know about Roman senators, medieval kings, Renaissance merchants. But the Bards great deeds were most likely done locked in a room with a quill pen and paper. We know virtually nothing about him.Not so with our public figures. Well clearly see between now and 2016 how the McConnell Senate, the Boehner House, and the Obama presidency interact  whether they are driven by party or personality or they play nice for the sake of the country. A telling moment or fateful exchange might determine what happens. Character and ideas might govern. A profile provides hints. History will tell the tale.John Yemma is editor-at-large of the Monitor.

Its funny because its true!"" reports Wonkette. ""Obama is so completely in favor of looting and lawlessness! If only hed maybe say that looting is bad, but no, all he does is just make excuses for looters all the time, like when he told people to go out and burn down Ferguson last week, remember when he said that?""Of course, Obama said nothing of the sort. What he did say after the decision was announced was this: ""I join Michaels parents in asking anyone who protests this decision to do so peacefully. Let me repeat Michaels fathers words: 'Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer.'' ""Those were actually code words for 'Burn stores and loot them,'"" quipped Wonkette.As Chris Rock recently found out, there's a fine line between comedy and offense, and Palin cuts it close."

Washington  Does anyone down there know how to do a deal? drawled the Senates top Republican, Mitch McConnell, over the phone to Vice President Joe Biden.It was Sunday afternoon on Dec. 30, 2012, with less than 34 hours to go before the United States would careen over the fiscal cliff. President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio had tried, and failed, to negotiate a deal to avert the steep tax hikes and brutal spending cuts scheduled to kick in on New Years Day. The challenge had fallen to Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D) of Nevada and Mr. McConnell, the minority leader from Kentucky.McConnell was prepared. Having anticipated the breakdown, he had already consulted his caucus and knew how far he could go. But that Sunday Senator Reid had suddenly broken off talks. Suspecting that Reid was willing to go over the cliff  but that the White House actually wanted a deal before then  McConnell bypassed him. Thus the overture to Mr. Biden.

The two men had brokered deals before, extending the George W. Bush-era tax cuts in 2010 and raising the debt ceiling in 2011  ending a game of brinkmanship that had turned the financial markets and the country into a nervous wreck. Now here was the vice president  a former senator known around the White House as the McConnell whisperer  returning the minority leaders call. Biden had the approval of his boss to start bargaining.

Over the next 24 hours or so, about a dozen phone calls were placed between the two men. They worked past midnight Sunday, with McConnells aides roasting hot dogs in an office fireplace for sustenance.On New Years Eve, as revelers scurried about Washington, the minority leader and vice president reached a modest but psychologically significant deal. Each side got something, and each side gave up something. The deal was vintage McConnell.Now that Republicans have trounced Democrats in the midterm elections, strengthening their grip on the House and retaking control of the Senate, the tough negotiator from Kentucky says he is ready to deal again. When the 114th Congress convenes in January, McConnell will finally reach his goal of majority leader  a job that has taken him three decades in the Senate to achieve and for which he has been preparing seemingly since grade school.But will this be McConnells moment? Can he overcome the gridlock, work with the president, and prove that Republicans can govern  as he has said he wants to do? It is the question of the hour, and yet, like the Capitol Dome currently imprisoned by scaffolding, the answer seems locked up tight. At least for now.Among the troika of power brokers in Washington  the president, the speaker of the House, and the Senate majority leader  McConnells jowly face is the only new one. He says he wants to work together with the president on important areas such as trade and tax reform. A master of Senate history and rules, he promises to return the gridlocked chamber to an institution of open debate and respect. He brings decades of determination, finely honed political instincts, and unmatched tactical skill to his job.Despite years spent blocking the presidents agenda  and campaigning against it  he has also stepped in to end several high-stakes crises, including last years partial government shutdown. John Feehery, who was once the spokesman for former GOP House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, called McConnell the indispensable man in those late-night fiscal cliff negotiations with Biden.And yet, the unflappable McConnell now faces a president who seems to have peeled off the no drama Obama label. His prime-time brandishing of his executive action powers on immigration  granting a deportation reprieve to millions of undocumented immigrants  enraged Republicans on Capitol Hill and will likely make it harder for McConnell to act or sound conciliatory as he prepares to put his stamp on the Senate. Rather than getting off to a smooth start, Washington may be headed for another showdown.Beneath it all the question looms: Even if McConnell is inclined to, can he make a difference in this kind of climate, or will he get pulled by Obama or members of his own party into two years of partisan sniping  the making of a movie trailer for 2016?In theory, this is precisely the type of legislator one might want heading the Senate if were looking to reach deals in a period of divided government, says Sarah Binder, a congressional expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. In theory.In his first press conference after the elections, McConnell said that one message from voters was to do something about dysfunction in Washington. I think there are a lot of people who believe that just because you have divided government, that doesnt mean you dont accomplish anything.He and others have pointed to the Reagan and Clinton presidencies  two times when Congress and the White House were occupied by opposing parties. President Reagan and Democrats in the House agreed on tax reform and a way to shore up Social Security; President Clinton and congressional Republicans agreed on welfare reform and a balanced budget.But Ms. Binder and others note that these are different times. First, there are fewer moderates in Congress with whom a president can cut deals. Second, the polarization that was once focused in Washington has gone national, fueled by 24/7 news coverage and social media, partisan bloggers and talk-show hosts.The building material of Clintons [time] doesnt exist, says Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. And Mr. Obama is not Bill Clinton. The fact is this is not a natural politician. This is somebody who is intelligent and eloquent, but probably the worst retail politician since Calvin Coolidge.Not only that, Obama seems delighted to tap his executive powers after years of being beat up by Republicans like McConnell and Speaker Boehner. Remember, it was McConnell who famously told the National Journal that the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.Still, says former Senate majority leader Trent Lott (R) of Mississippi, dont underestimate McConnell. The wheels could come off, he admits. On the other hand, heading up the Senate is something Mitch has been working toward for close to 50 years, he says. This is a lifetime work, and hes not going to let this opportunity fritter away.      McConnells political instincts were evident as early as his teenage years. An only child born in Alabama in 1942, he moved with his parents first to Georgia and then to Kentucky at age 13, when his father, a manager at DuPont, was transferred. The family settled in a middle-class neighborhood in Louisvilles south end.Young Mitchs interests turned from baseball to politics. Though he could swing a bat pretty well, he would prove far more adept at the game of electioneering. In junior high, he became vice president of the student council, but, as he commented wryly later in life, I never liked being vice president of anything.In high school, he moved one notch higher: He was elected student-body president by outmaneuvering a formidable rival. He secured celebrity endorsements from popular athletes, leafleted every locker in the large Gothic school, and reached down into the ignored lower grades for votes, according to a biography of McConnell, Republican Leader, by John David Dyche.He continued his political involvement at the University of Louisville, but the terrain was complex when he went there in the early 1960s. The urban university was mostly a commuter school, and Mitch lived with his parents at home, where the family Oldsmobile sported, at his doing, a Richard Nixon bumper sticker. He lost several campus leadership races until he realized the importance of the fraternities and sororities, which acted like competing political parties.McConnell joined one of the leading fraternities, Phi Kappa Tau. In his junior year, he masterminded a campaign to support a slate of candidates for the College of Arts & Sciences student council  with himself at the top for president.David Huber, who was a year behind McConnell and in the same fraternity, remembers his friends get-out-the-vote strategy: He instructed me and others to go to as many people within the sororities and fraternities and get as many people to vote for them [as possible]. Each person would be responsible for reaching out to five or 10 others, who would be encouraged to deliver the message to five or 10 more. This time he won.McConnells focus wasnt on ideology, says Mr. Huber, it was on winning. Putting together coalitions was what he did in college.And thats what hes done just about ever since  from his student-government days at the University of Kentucky College of Law, to his first election to public office as judge executive of Jefferson County (which includes Louisville), to winning a US Senate seat in 1984 (the only Republican to unseat a Democratic incumbent senator that year). He has become Kentuckys longest serving senator, and, along the way, almost single-handedly rebuilt the states GOP.McConnells ideology has traveled a considerable distance, too. Before entering law school, the 22-year-old interned with Kentuckys moderate GOP Sen. John Sherman Cooper, who was instrumental in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. McConnell admired the stand Mr. Cooper took on the legislation. Cooper turned from hawk to dove on the Vietnam War, which McConnell opposed, too.As a county executive, McConnell  by then a husband and father  was a moderate Republican, promoting historical preservation, abortion rights, and the environment. He reformed a system rife with cronyism by putting professionals in managerial jobs and worked with Democrats in the Louisville and county governments. He set a standard that all the mayors and judge executives have since followed, says Keith Runyon, a writer and editor for The Courier-Journal for 43 years.As the party evolved, so did McConnell. Now hes firmly antiabortion and wants to roll back federal environmental regulations that he says are killing Kentuckys coal industry. In the most recent election, he hammered his Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, incessantly tying her to an unpopular Obama. The candidates started out the race even in the polls. He ended up topping her by nearly 16 points.Mitch grew up in an era when Republicans were in a permanent minority, says Mr. Runyon. They had not controlled Congress since he was a boy in the 40s. That gave Republicans an inferiority complex, and Mitch has that built into him a little bit, Runyon notes. He coped with his underdog political status through deft use of the media and well-funded campaigns. Over the years, he has become one of Washingtons most ardent foes of campaign finance restrictions, which he equates with the suppression of free speech.Those who know McConnell describe him as very methodical. He has an ability to find allies, relies on a loyal network of supporters from whom he expects no drama and no mistakes, and possesses singular political instincts. In negotiations, he plots carefully, waiting for the right time to move. He will be very patient, says Mr. Feehery, the former aide to Speaker Hastert. Hes a tough negotiator. He knows his caucus.McConnells former chief of staff, Billy Piper, calls him the best hes seen at thinking through all the options and consequences. He always has a plan and is never hasty. He never makes unforced errors. Its not even chess, he says. Its three-dimensional chess.College friend Huber, who was Jefferson Countys chief administrative officer when McConnell was county judge executive, recalls how his boss would get lost in thought when they would occasionally walk to lunch.Wed be walking down the street. Hed be looking down and thinking  not looking at people. He wasnt ignoring them. He was thinking, says Huber. Thats why he is where he is. Id nudge him as people passed, and hed say Hi to them. Id have to explain to people, Well, he isnt stuck up. Its not that. He was just always focused on what was next.McConnell once said focus was the most important word in the English language. Its right up there with determination and tenacity, qualities that he credits to his mother when she helped him fight polio as a boy.Mitch contracted the disease as a 2-year-old in the summer of 1944. His mother took him to a polio-treatment center in Warm Springs, Ga., founded by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The staff showed her how to give her son physical therapy, which she carried out every day for two years, even as her husband was away in the Army. She also kept him off his feet, at the doctors request, by reading to him and drawing and playing with toys with him on his bed.The example of incredible discipline that she was teaching me during this period, I always felt had an impact on the rest of my life in terms of whatever discipline I may have been able to bring to bear on things I have been involved in, said McConnell in 2005 on the 50th anniversary of the polio vaccine.      In his expansive Capitol Hill office, McConnell keeps a portrait on the wall of one of his heroes and, notably, another lawmaker from Kentucky: Henry Clay. McConnell admires the 19th-century senator and statesman, known as the great compromiser, so much that he has had congressional resolutions passed mandating that Clays desk on the Senate floor always go to a lawmaker from Kentucky.McConnell also reveres another former senator, this one a Democrat from Montana and the 20th century  Mike Mansfield, the upper chambers longest-serving majority leader. There are many well-known stories about Mansfields fairness and equanimity as leader, McConnell said in a floor speech last January. They all seem to come down to one thing, and that was his unbending belief that every senator should be treated as an equal.McConnells admiration for both men offers some insight into where he wants to take the Senate as majority leader  and perhaps the nation. Indeed, in his January speech, which offered a road map to a GOP-run chamber, McConnell said he wanted to bring back the five-day workweek, return the power of legislating to committees, and allow amendments from both sides to come up for debate. This is in sharp contrast to Reids tight control of the legislative process  which, in turn, was a response to McConnells heavy use of the filibuster as a blocking mechanism.
These mechanical changes might seem arcane to many Americans, but their point is to lubricate the lawmaking process. Mc-Connell believes that if debate is allowed and amendments are voted on  even ones that may hurt individual Republican senators or the party  the best ideas will rise to the top and eventually become law. Senators will at least be allowed their say. Americas great debates, from the Civil War to civil rights, have gone through the Senate, the place where America finds its footing, he says. The nations problems cant be solved without open debate.Former majority leader Lott says that starting with even small bipartisan agreements can be contagious and lead to other agreements. Can McConnell pull it off in a chamber of big egos and sharp elbows, where it only takes one senator to bring things to a halt and 60 to restart it?This is his biggest test, says Jim Manley, a former aide to Reid. For a minority leader, stopping deals is easy. As majority leader, McConnell now has to juggle tea party renegades, GOP presidential aspirants, and Senate Democrats who will want to pin a do nothing label on Republicans as they head into the next election.Democrats remember well McConnell as chief blocker  leading more than 500 filibusters after Obama became president, shutting down the public option in health care and carbon cap-and-trade legislation. McConnell has made it clear that he still knows how to play rough. He intends to use budget measures that require only a majority vote to roll back regulations such as those on carbon emissions. And hes looking at a buffet of options to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, or parts of it, says McConnell spokesman Don Stewart.The conventional wisdom is that McConnells more open Senate will close like a drawbridge as soon as Democrats attach amendments designed to wound Republicans in the 2016 election  things such as a minimum wage hike or a pay-equity bill  which many in the GOP oppose. Members of McConnells caucus will pressure him to keep those bills off the floor, just as Reid suppressed GOP initiatives. Similarly, Democrats will seek to protect the president and themselves from legislation they deem harmful. The Senate will seize up, again.Not everyone buys into this narrative, though. Those prognosticators who say this will work for only a week are dead wrong, says Sen. Bob Corker (R) of Tennessee, known as a bridge-builder on the Hill. Not only is Mitch committed, but theres a large group of people from both sides of the aisle who are really frustrated with the way the Senate has been run.At least six Democrats, for instance, voted against Reid when he stood for reelection as party leader Nov. 13. His bottling-up of amendments never allowed Democrats to go on record for positions that differed from the presidents.One who voted against Reid was Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, from the energy state of North Dakota, a big proponent of the Keystone XL pipeline. The American people are tired of gridlock and so am I, she said in a statement to the Monitor. For months, I have been working to bring together some Republican and Democratic senators to try to get the Senate working again. She says shell continue that effort.Yet Democrats are not McConnells only worry. Tea partyers such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R) of Texas, who led the way last year to a partial government shutdown over Obamacare, may not want to compromise. He and other senators have already been advocating a funding showdown and blocking some of Obamas nominations in the new year over the immigration issue.The threat from McConnells right, to be sure, was ameliorated somewhat by the GOP establishments defeat of many tea party candidates in this years primary contests. He may also be aided by his tight relationship with fellow Kentuckian Sen. Rand Paul, a tea party darling who could prove useful in dealing with conservatives, despite his presidential ambitions and independent streak.Of course, even if McConnell succeeds in coordinating with the House, with all its rebels, and letting the Senate work its will, theres still the president to consider. The trick here is whether he and Obama can still do business  say, on reducing the corporate tax rate or finding a way to pay for Americas sagging infrastructure  even as each takes actions the other finds hostile.Its doubtful that they will suddenly develop a cozy relationship, with or without the so-called bourbon summit, the shared drink McConnell has said he will have with Obama (no time announced yet). But for the Senates supreme tactician, that may not be so important. With him, its all about business.He really does look at politics as a business, as a profession  as opposed to personality, sentiment, like or dislike of individuals, says Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.That no-nonsense sentiment may have been no more evident than at a football game in 2004. McConnell had flown to New Orleans to watch his beloved University of Louisville Cardinals take on Tulane University at the Superdome. Then-Kentucky state Senate President David Williams had arranged for McConnell to attend a reception hosted by Louisiana Republicans and supporters in a well-stocked luxury suite. Partway through the first half, Mr. Williams noticed McConnell was gone.He eventually found the senator across the Superdome in a small room furnished with only four metal folding chairs.Well, Williams said McConnell told him, I could see we werent going to make any attempt to watch the game over there.Staff writer Gail Russell Chaddock in Washington and contributor Ryan Alessi in Murray, Ky., contributed to this report."

New York  With a rare display of raw emotion, New York leaders expressed shock and sorrow after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict the white police officer whose headlock takedown contributed to the death of Eric Garner this summer.There were expressions of anger and outrage as well, of course. But after a second grand jury in two weeks declined to hand down indictments for two white police officers who killed two black men, both New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and the citys congressional delegation sounded a measure of tragedys ironic counterpart: hope.You can feel the emotion in us, not as politicians, as legislators, but as human beings, said Congressman Charles Rangel (D) as he stood with seven other representatives from New York during a press conference Wednesday in the nations capital.

We ... have an opportunity here in this tragedy to continue this conversation and turn it into more than a conversation, and into action and change, said Congressman Joseph Crowley (D), a representative of sections of the Bronx and Queens, during a press conference in Washington Wednesday. Not only in Missouri or in Florida or in New York City, but our entire country, continued Representative Crawley, who noted that his father and grandfather were proud New York City police officers.That sentiment was echoed by many New York City cops, who, though wary and feeling beaten down under accusations of racism and callous indifference toward the minority communities they police, also see a hope for dialogue and change.There is an opportunity right now in front of everyone, right up to the White House, says Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association and a 30-year veteran of the New York Police Department. Theres an opportunity for good leadership to come to the top and build bridges, based on these high-profile incidents, to create an understanding of police and community.Its an opportunity, too, with a certain sort of symmetry. Twenty years ago, then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani teamed with Police Commissioner William Bratton to address the citys rampant  though already falling  levels of crime with innovative and influential new methods of policing.Now, with crime at unheard-of record lows, Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bratton are teaming to address the rifts with new ideas and innovative practices  perhaps again with the opportunity to reshape the nature of American policing.Some changes are already taking place.Theyve dramatically reduced the number of times the controversial practice of stop and frisk has been used, and crime has kept falling. Theyre decreasing the number of low-level marijuana arrests  of which the vast majority, some 85 percent, have fallen on blacks and Latinos.And for the first time in the citys history, the NYPD isrequiring its officers to undergo additional tactical training each year. These are refresher courses, says Bratton, who remains well respected among the rank and file of the NYPD. The training will focus on de-escalating encounters and treating all citizens with respect, even during arrests.Here in this city, change is happening even in this moment when people are feeling pain and frustration and confusion. Change is happening right now, said de Blasio, who gave one of the most emotional speeches of his tenure so far at a press conference in Staten Island.Change is happening because the people willed it to happen, de Blasio continued, as he stood with community leaders. People believe the broken policy of stop-and-frisk had to end, and it has ended. The people believed there were too many young people of color arrested and saddled with a record for the rest of their lives simply for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that policy has been changed.Still, challenges remain myriad  especially with the ongoing mistrust that the NYPD has of the mayor and his close ally, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is persona non grata with the department.There is an understanding that this is a cultural problem, not a problem that is going to be fixed by changing one policy, or by a stroke of a pen, or any of the other things that we tend to expect from chief executives, says Kenneth Sherrill, professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College in Manhattan.So many white liberals thought that ending stop-and-frisk would solve the problem, he continues. But the reactions to Garner  as well as Ferguson  made it clear the problem was much deeper, the whole range of police and minority interaction, and that they werent going to be solved by throwing a switch.De Blasio himself said the problems of 2014 are deep-seated, portending a difficult journey ahead. Many of the profound problems between police and minority communities, he suggested, stem from centuries of racism.Such comments continue to anger police, who doubt his credibility as a leader as well as his ability to heal the current rifts.I think that the mayor is stepping off base when he begins to label certain issues racist issues, Sergeant Mullins says.Police were out in full force after the grand jury decision Wednesday, which was supposed to be a festive evening in New York City, with the traditional lighting of the iconic Rockefeller Christmas tree. Indeed, thousands of revelers came for the annual tradition of cheer, and wide-eyed shoppers passed by the citys famous department-store holiday window displays.But in a way perhaps unique to the sprawling cacophony of Manhattan, the revelry included thousands of sign-carrying protesters, escorted by a phalanx of grim-faced police officers, many on horseback or enclosed enforcement scooters.Still, Midtown was bright and bustling, sectioned off with crowd-controlling barriers at every turn, even as tourists and late-working New Yorkers in suits glanced over to watch the parade of slogan-chanting youths. No Justice, no peace, no racist police, was one common refrain.The opportunity present right now is one in which the direction of the nation can be changed for the better, Mullins says. But to do so, by saying that the police are all racist and the police are the bad guys, is not going to be productive: Its not going to be fair.At the very least, Ferguson and the Garner case are presenting lessons for the nation to consider.I dont like saying this is a learning moment or something of that sort, but in fact I think that a lot of political elites learned something from all of this [conflict] the past few months, says Sherrill."

				From a terrestrial view, our moon often looks like an inert ball of listlessness. But there is a lot more going on under the surface  or at least there once was. New research suggests that, that billions of years ago, the moon's core was home to circulating currents of electromagnetic energy.Scientists have known for decades that thesamples of lunar rock and crust retrieved by theApollo missions show signs of having once been acted on by a magnetic field.But today, the moon doesn't have a magnetic field. A compass, for instance, would be of little use there.So scientists were puzzled. What magnetized the rocks? We know it wasn't the Earth, as our magnetic field extends only about a quarter of the way to the moon.

Now, after decades of back and forth between the competing explanations, a duo of scientists have supplied strong evidence for the dynamo hypothesis.Benjamin Weiss, MIT associate professor and co-author of the new study, told the Monitor that scientists investigating the issue in the past had no simple way of figuring out which one was right.""How do you tell for the magnetic field, even if you know its strength, what produced it?"" says Weiss.One major problem was that the samples Apollo astronauts were bringing back were often fragmented. As a result, scientists were not always getting meaningful information because they didn't know the original orientation of the pieces in relation to each other.So Weiss and Sonia Tikoo of University of California, Berkeley, looked at smaller, simpler rock samples. With modern analytical techniques, they could then more easily extract information like when the rocks formed, how slowly they cooled, and their relative orientations. And during their research, the team found that associations between cosmic impacts and lunar surface magnetism, instances that had formerly kept the dynamo model from winning the day, might instead be explained by contamination from a single impact.If the lunar dynamo theory is true, scientists could more confidently classify the moon as a highly differentiated object, one that consists of a number of layers with distinct compositions and densities, similar to the planets in our solar system, as opposed to a ball of rubble that accreted over time and was captured by Earth.But it also raises a slew of new questions. If there really was a lunar dynamo, how did it come to be? How did it work? How long did it last? And why did it stop?Despite improvements in techniques for studying the age and origin of magnetic lunar rocks, answering these questions will not be simple. Weiss's team must determine what kind of mechanism could account for a number of findings: the vast range of magnetic intensities found in lunar rock samples, the dynamo's long life, and its abrupt and rapid decline in magnetic intensity at some point. There are models that can address answer some of these questions, but nothing fits perfectly yet.""There are only a few sources that seem to be able to power the dynamo late in its history,"" Weiss says.Those possibilities include what is known as core crystallization, where the core solidifies due to an abundance of sulfur, and a process called precession in which the mantle layer and core rotate about different axes, thereby producing energy. Similar to the initial debate over the origin of the moon's magnetic field, scientists have found evidence for both sources.Weiss says pinning down the timing of one event in particular may provide some answers, and that is the end of the dynamo's life.""The obvious next step is to figure out when the dynamo turned off,"" says Weiss. ""And that's not so easy.""""The lunar dynamo"" appeared Thursday in the journal Science."

Lima, Peru  In Peru's notoriously polluted capital, Lima, a local inventor is deploying giant air purifiers that double as billboards to suck up carbon dioxide and freshen the city's sometimes choking air.Jorge Gutierrez, a retired naval engineer, calls the 15-foot high (5 meters) box-like steel contraptions he helped design a ""super tree"" and says each one can convert as much carbon dioxide into oxygen as 1,200 trees.In Peru, which is hosting the United Nations climate change talks Dec. 1-12, the vast majority of electricity is generated from hydropower and natural gas, both relatively clean sources of energy. But exhaust-spewing buses and cars fill the city's air with throat-rasping fumes.

The machines, which each cost $100,000 to build but just $6 a day to run, suck in the dirty air and trap contaminants in water. Residual solids are eventually packed into secure containers that can be deposited at a landfill.Although the purifiers run on electricity, Gutierrez said the greenhouse gas emissions they produce are only a fraction of what they can remove. And they would quickly pay for themselves through advertising revenues, the creator said.They also offer passers-by the rare chance to breathe ""pure air,"" which is pumped into attached walk-in booths. A machine installed in front of a hospital in Lima's Jesus Maria district advertised ""free, clean air here"" and drew confused stares.So far, only two machines are up and running, financed by local businesses and charities. Gutierrez said some 400 would be needed to push back pollution levels in Lima, home to 10 million people and swarms of unregulated buses."

				Fallujah. The word alone conjures up grim images of Iraqs most intense urban combat, of insurgent snipers and dark narrow streets riddled with explosives, of militants lying in wait for days to kill Americans with assault rifles and grenades.Fallujah still haunts those who fought  jumping roof to roof and blasting through windows and doors night and day for weeks  to hunt down every insurgent in a city largely emptied of its 300,000 civilians. Fallujah even inspires awe among soldiers and marines who were not there in November 2004 for the battle that defined a new generation of American war fighters.US Marines  6,500 of them  led the charge. They found their enemy and killed them, or forced them into acts of suicide. In apocalyptic scenes during firefights, insurgents leaped with live grenades out of the shadows inside burning houses, or blew off their own heads as they ran out of bullets.

The company lost 20 percent, dead and wounded, of its own members in Fallujah  while expending more than 20,000 machine gun and rifle rounds, 300 grenades, 50 rockets, and 700 shotgun shells. I was embedded with Raider Platoon in Fallujah for the Monitor and took shrapnel in my arm.Military history books will record how Fallujah was demonstrably cleared of more than 4,000 Sunni insurgents in 2004. And they will mention that today Islamic State fighters control the city  a reversal for Fallujah that shocks and angers the many who had fought so hard and bled so much.But there is another, powerful history of Fallujah  about the toll of the after-war, and its effect on the Americans who fought in that battle.Ten years later, these marines still grapple with the memory of fallen comrades  and the guilt of surviving when others didnt. Often soaked with alcohol, they have struggled with multiple forms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal feelings, blinding rage, fits of violence, deflated expectations, and the challenges of daily life. They often bottomed out before they could rebound. Some have been saved by wives and girlfriends, by their own faith, and by their fellow fighters.There was a sense of importance, and clarity of purpose, that doesnt seem to exist in civilian society, says Capt. Cameron Albin, the former company executive officer, who has suffered heavily from PTSD since Fallujah and is now turning his life around in Austin, Texas.Reinventing oneself is not easy.... At one point, I was competent, capable, respected, and felt as though I could accomplish anything. Then it all evaporated, and I felt utterly useless, worthless. Regaining even a fraction of my previous confidence is a daily challenge.Similarly, the damaged lives of Charlie Company are almost impossible to quantify. Yet the problem is not going away, and Fallujah and the wider Iraq and Afghanistan wars have created a new generation of veterans with Vietnam-style issues that are costly and will be around for half a century, says Lt. Col. Gil Juarez, the company commander in Fallujah, who is still on active duty in the Washington, D.C., area.A decade ago after the heaviest fighting in Fallujah, then-Captain Juarez told me in a reflective moment that everyone has their limits, and their triggers. He worried that when marines no longer had their mission to focus on, back home is where things can happen.Indeed, surveying the results so far, Juarez says: We still dont know the price of these things.... America doesnt have a deep enough discussion [about] whats going to come after guys come home.Many of these marines wear bracelets to remember their dead. Ten years later, no one who fought in the caldron of Fallujah remains unchanged by its horrors. From the scorpion-pricked deserts of Texas to the deer-filled woods of northern Pennsylvania, this is the story of how the Death Dealers have coped with the pinnacle experience of that battle.The TexansWith a practiced arrogance, Matt McClellan steps up onto stones in his backyard, points his weapon over the high fence, and curls his lip as he pulls the feather trigger to unleash dozens of rounds.I had seen Mr. McClellan in a similar pose countless times a decade ago. As a young lance corporal with a pistol holster on his shoulder, he blasted his machine gun at Sunni insurgents in Fallujah, leaving a trail of smoking brass casings as the Death Dealers cleared blocks of houses.But today, McClellans tool of destruction is a $1,500 state-of-the-art paintball gun, and his target is a dumpster behind his suburban Midland, Texas, house, now splattered yellow. He is obsessed with paintball, and his Fallujah-honed prowess shows in competition. Hes considered going pro, but, at 31, he tells me he is too old and behind the power curve  never mind that, ever since Fallujah, his back is so messed up he can only sleep if there is a pillow under his stomach.The lanky and unshaven McClellan appears to be doing OK. He has a good job as a laboratory technician in a Texas oil town booming so much, he says, that when you throw a stone you hit three millionaires and a veteran. His wife, Melissa, works as a bartender and gave birth to their first baby on Oct. 21 to rapturous welcome.Weeks earlier, on a warm September afternoon, smoke rises from the barbecue, where the former marine repeatedly bastes two long racks of ribs with his own sticky brown sugar and chili-kick sauce. Beer flows and the dogs bark noisily and often, disrupting conversation.The tattooed McClellan is still a serial rule-breaker, as independent as he felt he was invincible in Fallujah. As a juvenile, he tallied 26 counts of grand theft auto, which were dropped from his record when he turned 18  a fact that Melissa, whom he married in late 2013, will first learn when she reads this. In his youth he had seven ear piercings on one side, six on the other, a tongue stud, and a lip ring.I never thought that trigger-happy Mick  as he called himself  would survive a decade after Fallujah. He jokingly says he thought the same about me.I always pictured World War II-style  like confetti and flags waving, and people so glad to see me, saying, I hope you come and work for us,  says the New Jersey native of his 2006 homecoming.But reality hit like an IED, and nobody hired him.I started getting into a bar routine. Id go to this bar on Monday, and that bar on Tuesday. I became a drunk.... All I cared about was wheres the next beer at, wheres the next party,  recalls McClellan. He was living on his veterans pay while Melissa worked. He says, I didnt care about her, only about staying home, video games, watching TV.Fellow Charlie Company war pig  named after the distinctive squat shape of the units armored vehicles  Mike Ball invited the couple to Texas in July 2009. They felt at home; all the hiring signs convinced them to stay. And nearby was another 1st LAR vet, Dustin Barker, who was having his own post-Fallujah issues. He had been close to McClellan in the Marines; their best friend was Lance Cpl. Kyle Burns, a cowboy from Wyoming who was killed in an ambush in the first days of Phantom Fury.Theyve all migrated to each other, says Melissa, praising the ad hoc mutual support network.Mr. Ball  today a Midland policeman who actually patrols McClellans neighborhood  for years blamed himself for the death of Burns, feeling guilty because his platoon had been sent to Najaf instead of Fallujah. In Najaf, Ball saved a marines life and was decorated for it. But guilt over Burns, and drinking after the Iraq experience, prompted him to disavow those awards, at one point throwing them out of his car window in a rage.Balls darkness for a time was so complete, it rivaled that of addicts. Even meth heads and crackheads are looking for another hit. But [Ball] had no light at the end of the tunnel. It was all negative, recalls McClellan. Hes better. Well talk about Kyle. To us, its better than going to a shrink.And in Texas, amid his fellow marines, McClellan himself snapped out of it.Hes come a million miles from when I first met him, says Melissa, who can solve a Rubiks Cube in under a minute. The first six months, I totally didnt think we were going to make it.... That whole Jersey bar scene [meant] he didnt have to live with whatever was going on in his head.Today, besides paintball, McClellan is still into eardrum-splitting heavy metal. His man cave is cluttered with beer bottles, and the house is full of high-end paintballing equipment  and cribs, strollers, and baby clothes for the new arrival. Since Ive been down here, he says, this is the best Ive ever done in my life.About 45 minutes from McClellans home, past scrubland pocked by always-moving jack pumps bringing oil up, Mr. Barker manages 300 head of cattle on a modest ranch  by Texas standards  of 33,000 acres.Barker, who wears a black cowboy hat with a band sweated through, crusty with dirt and holding a long turkey feather and several toothpicks, shares a rugged ranch life with his wife, Meredith, and their three children. The family killed 39 scorpions in their carport in just three days in September, and two days before I got there, Barker smacked a four-foot rattler with a shovel. Trophy deer heads with large antlers define the TV room  one of them shot by Meredith, a smiling pillar now for all the family.[Meredith] saved my life, theres no doubt about it, says Barker.When I get blackout drunk  and I got blackout drunk a lot  I just get mean, says Barker, matter-of-factly. He was raised in a Baptist family that did not drink, and before joining the Marine Corps, neither did he. He says 90 percent of his problems relate to Fallujah.I was hitchhiking, and passed out in the middle of the road, getting in fights, recalls Barker of his rough return to civilian life in mid-2006. She put up with so much of my [expletive] and got me to where I am now. In my mind, I would have been killed in a drunk-driving accident, or stabbed or shot, because I didnt care who you were, I was going to fight you.Back then, says Meredith, who has known Barker since junior high school, her husband had one default mode: Every emotion: If he was scared, it was rage. If he was sad, it was rage. If he was embarrassed, it was rage.Even after their beautiful wedding, recalls Meredith, they were drinking and something snapped and he lost it. He called her names, chased her back to the hotel room, and they got in a fight. Finally I just went out onto the balcony and hid in a corner until he passed out. I mean, that was our honeymoon.Barker was good at apologizing, but angry with himself, too.There were so many times I wanted to just smoke my [expletive] head, he says.On New Years Day in 2010, he nearly went over the edge during an argument with Meredith that escalated. Finally, Barker put a gun in his mouth. Honestly, at that point, I was just thinking pull the trigger and get it over with, and get this [expletive] done. I was ready to smoke myself.Meredith called 911, police arrived, and Barker was held for 30 hours. After that, he saw a counselor. They started talking. He always fell back on Fallujah.... I told him: You cant keep going back there because you are screwing everything up.Those days are over, says the man whose Marine Corps plaque in a bookcase with family photos is engraved to Dustin Hillbilly Barker, commended for unbounded enthusiasm and superb professionalism. One photo shows baby son Kyle  named after Burns  asleep in the helmet Dad wore in Fallujah.Theres too much to live for now to think of suicide anymore, says Barker, listing his wife, his kids, his house, and his ranch.McClellan, too, has good reasons to continue his rebound. Not to be outdone by Barkers Kyle, McClellan has named his new son Kyle Blake, after Burns and Lance Cpl. Blake Magaoay, who was also killed in Fallujah.I have plans for Kyle, McClellan says of the newborn, as Melissa smiles. When hes 10, Ill get him his first gun, and well play paintball.The IntellectFor Capt. Cameron Albin, solace from years of deepening PTSD and alcoholism finally came in the form of a sailboat and a puppy  and clearing his mind of everyday sensory overload.Deployed to Iraq for the 2003 invasion  when a 500-pound bomb was fired too close to his vehicle by a US jet fighter  he was back for Fallujah and hard-wired for the fight. Short, with penetrating eyes and a tongue that moves almost as quickly as he thinks  which is fast  Albin has been in and out of military rehab programs for years.Medically discharged in 2011, the Texas native today has put his boat up for sale, still enjoys his dog, and is studying in Austin for a masters degree in military history and to find an aim and purpose. He wants a PhD and hopes to teach. He swims, runs, and works out in the gym six days a week, and hasnt had a drink in two years.Thats the good news.The bad news is that PTSD for years wrecked his life, including brief jail time and two tickets for drunken driving, and he knows exactly why: When you first get off the plane [from Iraq], theres that feeling, Yea! I didnt get shot in the head, and Im back in the States. Party like a rock star!And its not until youve been home a few days and try to do something normal, like go to a grocery store, and you have some idiot hogging up the whole aisle ... and you want to reach out and strangle the ever-loving [expletive] out of them.Or you are waiting for some hajji to leap out of the frozen-food aisle and blow himself up, says Albin. To him, PTSD is more behavior modification run amok than anxiety disorder, thanks to Marine training and battlefield realities.Your brain has been altered to function in a permanently heightened state, with certain preprogrammed responses that are violent and aggressive, says Albin. Your brain is saying, Get ready, and your body is responding appropriately, but theres nothing to get ready for. There are no ninjas in Wal-Mart....As if searching for a way to synthesize his thoughts, he looks around at the prosaic scene in the Austin restaurant where I first met him to catch up  where the busboys work or dont, and the clientele ranges from misbehaving kids to older couples  and he reaches for an example. Have you ever had an eye exam, where they dilate your pupils and theyre taking in too much light so you have to wear sunglasses for the rest of the day?Imagine that happening to all your senses. That is the hypervigilance component. Your senses have been permanently dilated to take in all this information, and when youre in some place like this, your fight or flight response is being triggered.... Its a really [messed] up way to live, and its exhausting.When he was drinking he often had flashbacks, including one of when he nearly shot an insubordinate marine in 2003. One flashback in 2012 was triggered, he thinks, by odd overhead streetlighting that took him back to Baghdad: Some gangbanger wannabe punk sitting in his car decided to talk [disrespectfully] to me as I was wandering around, walking out of a bar. I guess he just thought I was some skinny white dude, and instead of talking to Cameron the drunken boat hippie, he was talking to Lieutenant Albin, circa 2003, and that [guy] was crazy!So apparently I reached through the window, pulled out my pocketknife and held it up to his eyeball. I said: Get the [expletive] out of the car. I thought he was being an ornery hajji, says Albin. The cops got called.... I remember snapping out of it, finding myself standing in the parking lot.... When the cops arrived, I remember putting my hands in the air and asking them, What happened? Whats going on? What did I do? Then they tackled me.He was jailed for two weeks.In those days, grain alcohol was his primary form of nutrition. Several abuse programs failed, he says, because they did not address the underlying cause: living with the ghosts of Fallujah and Iraq.Fallujah left its mark on everybody; it just manifested itself in different ways on different people, says Albin. In late 2012, for example, he had a call from Greg Eddleston, the company maintenance chief in Fallujah. Mr. Eddleston was struggling with alcohol and the Department of Veterans Affairs had told him he had PTSD. Albin joked that they all had it, that he was making progress and would help Eddleston.I thought he was doing all right, recalls Albin.But a couple of days later, he got a text message from Eddleston that ended with his Fallujah radio call sign: Its morning here now, but it is night for me. I am in a hell that very few know and I am worn thin. I am tired of fighting and I brought more pain I can not go through again. I bid you good bye. Black 9 out.That day, Eddleston committed suicide.Four months later, Albin lost another friend, a former marine who was going to sail with him one morning across Chesapeake Bay, but never showed up. I never heard from Dave, says Albin.He later found out from a police investigator that Dave, apparently drunk, had killed another buddy, and then himself. For Albin, sailing taught a better path. He may one day start a nonprofit that uses sailing to treat PTSD.You get people away from the sensory clutter of everyday life. You put them on sailboats, put them in the woods, put them on a mountaintop; you have them make sombreros in the desert in New Mexico ... so that they can find some clarity of thought, says Albin. Then they can identify problem behaviors and come up with tangible solutions.If there was anything I lost ... that I wish I could have back  in addition to those 23 IQ points that were blasted out of my head  it would be the sense of focus, the intensity, and the ability to follow through, adds Albin.Are you easily distracted? I ask the guy known for intelligent focus and a way with words back in Iraq.Oh yeah, its like: Squirrel! The Wise ManThe wake-up call comes at 4:52 a.m., when Alison starts to cry. The voice of his daughter, a sprite of an 18-month-old with wispy blond hair, soon stirs former marine Tim Milholin. He comes downstairs to the kitchen and starts making coffee  just as making coffee was the corporals first order of business for us in Fallujah every day, a decade ago, on a small camp stove on the floor in whatever abandoned house or wrecked building we had laid our sleeping bags in.By 5:45 a.m., his wife, Brianne, is downstairs, too, making school lunches for Jadyn and Savanna, who arrive for breakfast and add to chalk drawings on a large blackboard of characters from the movie Frozen.It may not be exactly the image of blessed contentment that Mr. Milholin expected. Ten years ago in Fallujah he told me he was looking forward to the simple life, including a house with a porch and a rocking chair, and cleaning my shotgun all day.But up here north of Trout Run, in heavily wooded, gun-toting north-central Pennsylvania where permanent signs say Hunt Safely, the Fallujah veteran has indeed begun to live the dream, with a picture-perfect, red-shuttered, two-story house at the end of a long driveway.So far there are only two kid-size rocking chairs on the porch, because Milholin has been too busy for one. He carried a photograph of his bride, Brianne, in his helmet in Fallujah, and Jadyn was born before he left the Marines in 2006. Since then, the family has grown, and moved, and Milholin has earned degrees in engineering and surveying.I dont think he really had time to fall apart. Maybe he had something to come home and look forward to, says Bri, about how Milholin has coped with the Fallujah after-war.This is definitely our sanctuary. We are definitely blessed, says Milholin, who credits family and faith for his being able to keep it all together.In Fallujah, he was one of the three religious Wise Men in the company, and still has the blue zip-up Bible he kept next to his heart in Fallujah, under his armored vest, the sweat of multiple operations still sticking onionskin pages together.Nearly a decade ago, he told me how he prayed every day, and believed during battle that God puts his angels out before us, to protect us.That guidance continues. I didnt know what I wanted to do, but when I stopped worrying, and spent a lot of time in devotion, Milholin says, God put [engineering] in my heart. Everything fell into place.He adds: Having that faith to rely on [is] where my strength comes from, from my faith in Jesus Christ and the close-knit family.But Fallujah had an impact. I remember Milholin as part of the first entry teams into houses during clearing operations, day after day, who raced through their own grenade smoke, sweating hard with guns up, room after room.He has the original Death Dealers banner  a home-made skull and crossbones superimposed over a cross  that flew for a time over our scout vehicle. That flag may one day be framed, and its design inked onto his back.[Bri] says I am a lot less emotional now. She always makes comments that she has never seen me cry, says Milholin. I definitely think it hardens a person, going through those experiences, and makes you less quick to react with emotions.... Its a natural way to protect yourself.These days he enjoys making maple syrup, which requires boiling down 40 gallons of sap for every gallon of syrup. This year  tapping his trees and a neighbors  he made 4-1/2 gallons of syrup. He has a modest orchard and blueberry bushes and strings of grapevines.Weve got a little chunk of Paradise, admits Milholin, who works for a survey company and spends most of his free time with his family, his syrup, and his plot of land. I dont know why me versus somebody else gets to have a life like this, while so many were either taken from us too early or have to suffer through things.Random memories of Fallujah and the 2003 invasion are still set off by watching a movie or hearing a song. When he was in the Dominican Republic on a church-related trip to help build schools, the smell of burning trash and poverty set off his emotions.And there are other subtle changes that he deals with daily.Crowds, cities, I just dont like them, says Milholin, who often carries a pistol. Bri makes fun of me because she says when we go to a restaurant, I have to sit in the gunfighters seat with a good view and no people behind me.Yet the porch and his own rocking chair still beckon.Im getting there.... Thats still the goal!The Lone RangerIts near midnight, and police officer Kevin Boyd turns his patrol car left down a narrow lane between old small living units on the northwest fringes of Pittsburgh. There is a sprinkling of rain and the scent of lower income desperation.Ive probably been into every one of these houses, says Mr. Boyd. He takes many domestic violence calls, and Pittsburgh is known as a heroin town. He may be working in mostly middle-class districts, but just days before my September visit with him he came across two people passed out in a car with needles still stuck in their arms.For Boyd, wearing a police uniform the past seven years  and recently joining the north Pittsburgh call-up SWAT team  was a natural extension of his time in the war in Fallujah, a combat rush that he says completely defined him.A born warrior and lifelong gun aficionado, with a gung-ho attitude and frontline fearlessness that propelled him up the ranks to gunnery sergeant in record time, Boyd wore his first camouflage at age 3, shot BB guns at Tiger Cub camp, and owned his first gun at 15.He was an Eagle Scout, and on his police uniform below his SWAT badge he wears ribbons for combat and his Purple Heart  earned in Fallujah when shrapnel struck his chin.His young-looking face hasnt aged a day since then. On one police call, a woman called him a snot-nosed kid.Boyd shifted from the active-duty Marines to the reserves in 2005. Then in 2010 he volunteered to spend seven months in Afghanistan for one last adventure. Even before the unit left the United States, one fellow reservist committed suicide.They were meant to quietly guard bases but were instead sent to remote Marjah, in southern Helmand Province, where they were caught up in firefights almost every day. Boyd had the words The Lone Ranger on his helmet there, as in Fallujah he had them written on his gloves  along with his blood type and kill number (A+, X18), the designation used to identify the dead or wounded over the radio network without using names.The Taliban welcome on the first patrol was a mine packed with used car parts that took a sizable chunk out of one reservist. Boyd hadnt been in combat in five years, but Fallujah had permanently sharpened his instincts. He didnt miss a beat.The first things that come out of my mouth are Get cover! and Look for secondaries! and everyone [else] is standing there, deer in the headlights, says Boyd of the awestruck younger men. He tied on two tourniquets, and may well have saved the marines life.His girlfriend of a couple years, Rachel, took the Afghanistan tour horribly, he says, because she had moved to be with him in Pittsburgh.Despite the firefights, Boyd had a custom engagement ring made while he was away, and proposed to her the night he got back. I was still in cammies, says Boyd, of his camouflage uniform. She was ecstatic. Very, very happy.In all his years on the police force, he has pepper-sprayed one person and used a stun gun on two  and has never used his gun. We have a quieter area. So I feel like I still have very good restraint and control. Do I get mad and yell and go gunnery sergeant sometimes? Yeah, sometimes you need to, says Boyd. But other times, Im the biggest sweetheart youll ever meet.He prefers night shifts because hes a drunks and drugs kind of cop, while during the day, peoples problems are too small. I just dont relate to some of them, he says. You get the barking dog. You get the raccoon.Boyd says his drive, motivation, and need to keep busy have meant little time for negative fallout from Fallujah. Instead, the combat and scenes of streets lined with dead insurgents and body parts has prepared him to handle bad car accidents and suicides.I am thankful for what I have had the privilege to experience, as good and as bad as it was, says Boyd. It was a privilege. I cant believe I was able to go through that stuff and still be OK with things, and working.There are a handful of toy soldiers on his desk at the police station; his desk drawer is packed with ammo and gun-cleaning gear.There is a gun safe for his specialized weaponry  on the job, Boyd carries his own Nighthawk Enforcer 1911 pistol. I always say my bling is my weapons, he says, with a kid-in-the-candy-shop smile. So instead of having a $3,000 watch, I have a $3,000 pistol, because its the custom stuff.At home now he has more than 30 weapons, some requiring federal permits, in a downstairs hideaway that smells of gun oil. On the wall is a large photograph of mine: Boyds gloved hands in Fallujah holding a couple rifle clips. The gloves themselves are resting on the side of the stairwell, among mementos.Some guys do Fantasy Football, or collect stamps. Some guys golf, says Boyd. I dont golf. I collect guns and I go to the shooting range.Almost every day on the street, he sees the other, darker side of less-fortunate veterans  DUIs, stuff like that, he says. Its slow for them to get back into the swing of life.... Have I shed tears for Kyle and everybody? Of course. Theyre family members; theyre friends, says Boyd. That is raw emotion that needs processing and separation from the real bad stuff, but it doesnt need to be overanalyzed, he says.It was what it was. It was war. You cant sugarcoat it; you cant say it wasnt real. What happened to Kyle could have happened to me at a moments notice, says Boyd. We are lucky and thankful and blessed we are here.The FinancierThe aspiring certified public accountant wakes at 5 a.m. in Falls Church, Va., studies hard for his exam, and leans into his work with a neck injured four times in Fallujah and other US Marine ops.The immaculate apartment is tastefully done in all white, the books and computer needed to study for the final part of his CPA exam spread across the table  the only glimpse of chaos in the room.Christopher DeBlanc keeps a Glock 19 pistol with a 15-round magazine that is the gun I trained on, the gun I carry, he says. You never know when a situations going to pop up. And who is the first responder to any situation? Its the person whos there.Tall, with hair kept combat short, Mr. DeBlanc today projects an air of confidence and puts thought into his words. But his post-Fallujah life has been one of dramatic transformations.Broke when he left the Marines in 2005, DeBlanc now is very excited about finance and accounting, and contributes all he can to his 401(k) retirement funds. His usual fiscal discipline eventually gave way to his one reckless purchase in life  a black BMW 335i xDrive parked in the basement garage below.DeBlancs first marriage fell apart after he returned from Fallujah, because his wife didnt understand the impact of his experience. But now there are smiles again: DeBlanc remarried in September to a fellow finance wizard, a US-educated Afghan woman and former college classmate named Sofia who became his best friend as he struggled for years with bouts of rage.DeBlanc, whose nickname was Debo in the Marine Corps, went to community college and then university, has a degree in business administration, and works as an accountant. But returning from Fallujah was brutal, says the marine who, as a team leader on the battlefield, was determined to succeed.Your whole world is survival. Its very simple: What do I have to do to survive? Theres nothing else to think about, says DeBlanc.The next thing, when you get back, its cellphone bills and rent and groceries and cars broken. The complexity of life grows exponentially. And that initial shock I did not handle very well, recalls DeBlanc.Ultimately, it all boils down to control. And when you are in Iraq and youve got a gun, you control the world. You exert that control with violence, he says. So when you come back to the States ... where you have no control over the situations around you, I think you revert back to what worked before: violence. Of course, in society you cant exert violence. So at that point, I think helplessness sets in ... and rage. Blinding rage.Did you experience that, I ask? Oh yeah, all the time, every day. And it would be the littlest thing  things like the toilet paper being hung upside down.Everything would go red, and I would explode, says DeBlanc. Yelling, poles through doors, throwing stuff. When I was out and about, in front of people, I think I was fine; I put on a good show. But inside, at home, my wife saw everything. She took the brunt of it, unfortunately. Thank God I didnt beat her or anything like that.The couple had dated just six months before DeBlanc deployed to Iraq for the 2003 invasion. When he came back, they got married. Even back then, he felt his first bursts of rage. But then he was back in Iraq  this time, Fallujah.DeBlanc was all business and God, one of the three religious Wise Men. Gone were his youthful flirtations worshiping the guitar. He told me at the time, [I] didnt like how my life was going, so I gave it to the military. He wanted to emulate his grandfather, a World War II veteran buried with honors.But in Fallujah, as other marines called home, or were quoted in the Monitors pages about missing their loved ones, DeBlanc only spoke about the mission. He made his one brief call an anodyne chat about finances. She hated me for that, recalls DeBlanc. When he got home he threw himself into life, working 50 hours a week at a lumber yard, going to school full time, and being married. It wasnt sustainable.When he was in public he was skittish and always looking over his shoulder. One time driving on the highway, a tractor trailer next to him blew a tire. I blacked out. It was like an IED going off. All I remember was, I was in the desert. I heard this boom, and I was in the desert in a Humvee. Then I snapped out of it and I was miles down the road.In 2008 he was politely asked to leave the house, says DeBlanc. That was when I realized I had a problem, like Im a lunatic, I cant control myself. His wife asked for a divorce, prompting unbearable pain.I could barely function it was so bad, says DeBlanc. Everything that I had built my life around and was working hard for, at work and school, for a successful family, it all fell apart. Everything that was holding my world up was gone, so I crashed.Remarkably, the divorce ended DeBlancs rage. It was gone. It was a cleansing. I could sleep at night. I didnt have nightmares  and I had had nightmares for three years, waking up looking for your rifle, or getting overrun, youre clubbing Iraqis with your rifle, just crazy stuff. And that was the last of them.But rebuilding took time.Sofia could sense his hurt, recalling that his smiles were not real smiles. She says she felt he needed someone to give hope [that] it is not the end of everything, and the sun will rise again tomorrow morning.She also had her own war-related experience. Her family had moved to Pakistan when she was young to escape war in Afghanistan, where she had witnessed explosions and many casualties. She was chosen for a study program in the US and today works as a CPA, playfully niggling her husband about his upcoming test.Sofia calls her husband a real-life hero for overcoming his challenges. DeBlanc took a job with DynCorp, and from late 2011 to mid-2013 worked in northern Iraq to provide security for US diplomats. He Skyped Sofia every night.Surprisingly, going back to Iraq did not trigger bad vibes, he says. It felt like coming home. I had a gun, and I had power. And life became simple again.How did the fight in Fallujah affect his religious faith?At that moment in Fallujah, I had come to terms with the fact that Im about to meet my creator, that Im going to die. So its easy to be close to God, says DeBlanc. When you are back here, dealing with life, I guess I find myself drifting away.A decade ago, on Day 12 of the Fallujah offensive, several marines got into an argument about religion while cleaning their weapons. DeBlanc said, God has a perfect plan.He still reads his Bible, but less now. And he hasnt been to church since going overseas in 2011.Hes still working that plan out, says DeBlanc. I am not as close to God now as I was then. If I had [been killed] at that time in Fallujah, I was completely ready. Now, I may not feel as ready.The CommanderDay 14 in Fallujah, and gunfire erupts nearby. We are clearing houses, and the radio carried on one marines back bursts to life: Another platoon ha been ambushed, and there are casualties.My sharpest memory of the company commander, Capt. Gil Juarez, is defined by what happened next. When I race back, he is directing the battle fromthe turret of his war pig wearing a helmet, headset, and his look of understated master-of-the-universe determination.The fight is overthere! he shouts to me, pointing down a long block and to the left. Its a typical decrepit Fallujah street, strewn with debris and trash, and lined with low-hanging cables that give it a tunnel effect. Insurgent snipers have been shooting it up.His belt-fed M240 machine gun is already pointed down the length of the street. Juarez puts his gloved hands up to the weapon.I will cover for you, but you mustrun! he roars. And as the shooting starts, I run the length of that urban gantlet fast, holding two cameras close, chest heaving under the weight of a bulletproof vest with its two heavy armor plates. Around the corner were wounded marines, and the start of a fierce firefight with four insurgents that would go long into the night and yield more marine casualties  one dead and eight wounded, in all  and a pea-sized piece of shrapnel burned into my arm.Juarez is the marines marine, a commander who at once remains aloof from his men  demanding, receiving, and earning unquestioned loyalty  while also serving as one of the brethren, unafraid of dirt-level war fighting, of the decisions that put them in harms way, and unafraid to describe the bond shared by marines as love.So I understand now, a decade later, when one marine says this about Juarez: I would follow that man to the gates of hell, again. I heard that sentiment repeatedly, about a man who is still in the US Marines, who has since commanded the entire 1st LAR battalion, and who is today getting a masters degree at the Marine Corps War College in Quantico, Va.But the demands of leadership in Fallujah have a particular cost, when your decisions inevitably raise the death toll.You always know, in the back of your mind, youre going to do all you can to take care of your guys. But at the end of the day, the enemy gets a vote, and things dont always go according to plan, says now-Lt. Col. Juarez in his apartment across the Potomac from Washington, D.C. There are surprises, its dangerous, and people get killed. And your decisions are the things that drive those people into those situations.He is philosophical about the price paid in Fallujah and says he would do anything to get back any one of the six marines who died in that deployment under his command. But, he adds: Its called war, and its called combat for a reason.... Ive tried never to lose sight of that. Those marines died doing what they volunteered to do. Youve got to respect that ... because there are always the what ifs, a million what ifs.In Fallujah, Juarez was an uncompromising taskmaster, but with a common touch. During one operation, when a slightly wounded marine was escorted back to base, taking him and the one available medic away from the front line, Juarez invoked the memory of a Vietnam-era Medal of Honor winner.Youre [expletive] marines. You suck it the [expletive] up, Juarez admonished. Do not pull combat power out of the [expletive] fight unless you have to. Like [expletive] John Bobo in Vietnam. [Expletive] leg blown off, he [expletive] sticks his stump in the ground and he mans a machine gun so his platoon can withdraw. That has to be your mind-set. We clear on that?Likewise, on Thanksgiving Day, 2-1/2 weeks into the Fallujah offensive, a turkey feast was sent to the frontline house we were occupying. There had not been water or time enough to bathe and until then wed only had meals ready to eat. Juarez took several steps up a staircase to say grace for all the company. Some of you might not pray. Some of you might, he said, using the voice of a reluctant preacher. Many pulled thick hats off buzz cuts and clasped their hands in front of them. Juarez said:Lord, thank you for keeping us alive....Keep us strong. Keep us together.Make us shoot faster than the enemy.Make us move faster than the enemy.When he tries to kill us, let us kill him first.Take care of our families.And definitely take care of our friends that are gathered here today.For truly there is no better group of men,than the men you see here before you.The risks of the aftermath of Fallujah for Juarez were evident when the unit stopped off in Thailand on the way home. The stories of heavy drinking and debauched celebrations are legend. When it was over, Juarez wanted to set an example. He announced that he was quitting drinking for good  a promise he has kept.It was a big step for the California native with a tough upbringing, the only one of five siblings to graduate from high school and not get involved with gangs. His older brother is a heroin addict now serving a life sentence in California; he has not seen his sister, addicted to crystal meth, for two decades.Juarez says he got lucky when his family moved to a new neighborhood when he was 14. He had good teachers, ran cross country, and finally channeled being a hell-raiser into the Marine Corps, which he says saved his life.That experience is what shaped his Fallujah after-war. Alcohol is the medication, its the relief, but unfortunately it sucks you in, he says.I told the company: Life now is about not taking a step back. Youve been through a tremendous event, part of our history now ... but life is hard, and that doesnt get you much, Juarez says now. The world may not know or care to know what happened here. Thats tough, especially for young guys that have been through that.When he got home, Juarez says he knew he had grown impatient and took it out on my family. It took a long time to process that, some anger.His wife, Cyndi, stayed with him. When we were younger, I used to say: We did deployments great, we did reunions very poorly,  she says.After Fallujah, Juarez was in project mode, she recalls. He took the roof off the house, he tore down the deck  there was nothing wrong with the roof, the roof was fine! He just had to stay busy, kind of engaged.Juarez has kept in touch with many of his Fallujah marines and the families of the fallen, ready to guide and support. Its hard, because you build a family so tight when you go on a deployment, and when you do go in a fight, you become even closer. Then you come back, and ... the teams going to get broken up, and youre going to go different places. Youre not going to have those close buddies with you all the time.I just try to get them to be true to themselves, to honor the brothers they lost and the sacrifices they all made, he says. [I]ts all about when you are an old man and you look in the mirror: What are you going to see? What are you going to reflect back on?... Thats more important than anything we did in Fallujah, that they continue to do their best to maintain their honor, to live a good life, to look out for each other, to look out for others. Theres nothing more valuable than that, he says.They love each other. Thats really whats helped these [marines] get through it all, adds Juarez. Theyve not lost that. They love each other to death ... they love each other so much it gets in the way of the rest of their life."

Washington  If you want to graduate from high school in North Dakota, you better start buffing up on your American history and government.Lawmakers in North Dakota unveiled legislation Monday that would require high school students to get60 questions right on a 100-question civics test before they graduate. These range from the number of justices on the Supreme Court to the number of amendments to the Constitution. Immigrants hoping to become US citizens must correctly answer six of 10 questions randomly chosen from the 100-question test.North Dakota is the latest state mulling a requirement that students pass a citizenship test before theyre handed a diploma. At least seven other states are considering similar measures. Its part of a broad effort to increase youth civic engagement, at a time when many worry that students know more aboutTaylor Swift thanZachary Taylor.

		Could you pass a US citizenship test?
The people who favor this have widely differing political beliefs, said North Dakota first lady Betsy Dalrymple when announcing the measure on Monday. But they share the belief that it is important for all Americans to know about the first principles of our constitutional government.""

But some are skeptical that a citizenship test is the best way to get students excited about US government and politics. Others question whether the US citizenship test is the most logical way to promote youth engagement.The solution is not more testing of everything. We already have excessive testing going on in schools, says Marya Levenson, director of the education program at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.Ms. Levenson  a former high school civics teacher herself  says schools should foster dialogue around unresolved issues such as immigration and gay marriage.The controversies are what really engage our students. We need to present multiple sides and ask our students to think themselves about how they would begin to resolve it, Levenson says.Even if a test can bolster students knowledge of government, the US citizenship test may not be the test for the job, says Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.These types of tests evaluate encyclopedia knowledge, Mr. West says, adding that the citizenship test doesnt really focus on broad issues or controversies, which tend to be the things that engage people in the political process.West points to the College Boards government test as a more reliable tool to evaluate students mastery of civics.The citizenship test given to new Americans is far from perfect. It isnt a reliable measure of civics knowledge, according to a 2011 Michigan State University study, and political scientists say one question the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) put on the test could be incorrect  it implies the vice president is a member of the presidents Cabinet.USCIS doesnt have any data that they offer to the public about this test in the way that testing companies would talk about their tests, says Paula Winke, a professor at Michigan State University and author of the 2011 study. That means that, to determine whether or not the test they offer is reliable, states would have to run their own analyses.Supporters say a civics test is a step toward bolstering civics education in American schools. The exam is meant to be informative, not punitive, says Sam Stone, spokesperson for the Civics Education Initiative, the nonprofit pushing the test nationwide. Students would be able to take the test until they pass.Announcing the legislation in North Dakota, Ms. Dalrymple said many students struggle with basic US history. Dalrymple cited studies showing many students dont know that George Washington was the first US president.Every new citizen has to demonstrate this knowledge, so this is creating a community standard of what we want everyone to know, Mr. Stone says. This is a basic test.Schools would have flexibility in giving the test, Stone adds, meaning students could wind up taking anything from a 10-question verbal exam to a 100-question written test.North Dakota legislators will take up the bill in January. South Dakota, Arizona, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah are all considering adopting the test as well, Stone told the AP.Think you could pass the test? Take the Monitors US citizenship test to find out."

				Linda Casher moved to this Israeli collective near the Gaza Strip as a young American woman in the 1970s, she would often mingle with Palestinians at outdoor markets amid the mounds of pomegranates and rows of hanging chickens. She would hitchhike alongside Palestinian workers waiting for minibuses, and she even welcomed Palestinian women from Gaza to her kibbutz, Yad Mordechai, which has a tradition of supporting initiatives that encourage coexistence.But no longer. The closest she has gotten to a Palestinian from Gaza lately was when Hamas gunmen emerged from the sea onto nearby Zikim beach to infiltrate southern Israel in this summers war. It was a long way from sharing coffee and cake at the kibbutz clubhouse.Zikim freaked me out, says Ms. Casher, who asked her soldier son whether guns could still shoot after being submerged in water. We sit on that beach all the time.

			How much do you know about Israel? Take the quiz
		
Two miles south of this community stands a towering cement wall at the Erez checkpoint, the only Israel-Gaza border crossing for travelers. Israelis have not been allowed to enter the Gaza Strip in years, after a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings racked Israeli society and the militant Islamist movement Hamas rose to power in 2006. The number of Palestinian workers crossing daily from Gaza into Israel has dropped from tens of thousands to zero.

We have a great big barrier between us and the Arabs, so we dont see them and we dont feel them, says Casher, who sees the separation as imperative given the security threat.Twenty years of fruitless negotiations, three conflicts with Gaza in the past six years, and growing fears of Islamist extremism in the Palestinian territories and around the Middle East have all contributed to a growing skepticism among many Israelis that peace is possible.As attitudes have hardened and hopes for a resolution have retreated, Israelis have increasingly walled themselves off, physically and psychologically, from their Arab neighbors. That has put a complete stop to suicide bombings since 2009, but it has also limited meaningful engagement.To critics, this fortress mentality has allowed distrust and disillusionment to fester on both sides, complicated Israels relations with other parts of the world, and made any solution to the decades-old conflict even more remote. But to many Israelis it is the best way to deal with an intransigent foe, protect the Jewish nation, and manage a conflict that, for now, defies resolution.This type of conflict ends when at least one side is tired. And I dont think Hamas is tired; I dont think Israelis are tired, says Efraim Inbar, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. They still have energy to fight. Under such circumstances ... managing the conflict, trying to reduce bloodshed and the suffering of the people, is a decent strategy.""An Israeli who used to work as a lifeguard at a beach in the Gaza Strip remembers, not long ago, when he could ride his motorcycle to and from his home in Israel through the sand dunes of this sun-splashed landscape. Now hes sitting at a cafe at the Yad Mordechai gas station, barred from crossing into Gaza, an area he called home for more than 15 years  years, he says, that were the happiest of his life. He spent long nights on the sea with Palestinian fishermen, who split their profits with him. He helped them outside of work, too, sometimes resolving problems with Israeli tax authorities.I cant say they were like brothers, he says, but notes that both he and his Palestinian colleagues shared the attitude, If you need something, I will help you.The man, who did not want to be named, says things got worse in the 1990s after the Oslo Accords, when Israel built a security barrier around the Gaza Strip and handed control of civil affairs over to Palestinians. One day one of his Arab workers at the beach came to him and said hed been detained, interrogated, and beaten by Palestinian authorities. They suspected him of feeding intelligence to his Israeli boss  wrongly presumed to be a security officer.They almost killed me because of you, the worker told him. I will never come [to work] again. I just wanted to come and tell you.When the second intifada broke out in 2000, militants destroyed most of the barrier around the Gaza Strip. It took the Israeli army six months to rebuild it. Five years later, Israel unilaterally withdrew its soldiers and 8,000 citizens from Gaza in a controversial move that it promised would bring quiet. Instead, Hamas filled the vacuum and began launching rockets into Israel.Leftists opposed the governments choice of making a unilateral withdrawal, instead of coordinating it with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and giving him proof that negotiations could yield tangible results for Palestinian statehood. The criticism was not unfounded: Dov Weissglass, chief of staff to then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, referred to the move as formaldehyde that would keep the peace process in a dead state.Those on the right, meanwhile, felt betrayed by Mr. Sharon, who for decades had championed the settlement of Palestinian areas as essential to Israeli security. They opposed ceding territory to the enemy, seeing it as a recipe for heightened aggression rather than peace.Rocket fire from Gaza decreased immediately after the withdrawal, but then became worse: More than 15,000 rockets have been fired on Israel since then, according to Israeli statistics.Many Israelis remain concerned that withdrawing from the West Bank could lead to a similar uptick in attacks, but from a territory that is nearly 15 times bigger than Gaza and sits far closer to Israels heartland. The West Bank hills afford a commanding position over Israels main international airport, Ben Gurion, just six miles away, as well as greater Tel Aviv  Israels Silicon Valley.So far Israels containment strategy has worked fairly well in the West Bank, where it erected a serpentine barrier to keep out suicide bombers and heightened security coordination with the Palestinian Authority. Though 30 percent of the barrier remains to be constructed, a Palestinian suicide bombing hasnt happened in the area since 2009. Some say that stems more from the role of PA security forces and a realization that violence doesnt pay. But in the Israeli mind, the barrier stands as a firm defense against terror.In fact, barriers  reminiscent of the ancient Judean fortresses of Israelis ancestors  are now widely embraced as an effective way to fortify modern Israel despite the international opprobrium barriers bring. In 2013, Israel completed a 145-mile fence along the Egyptian border. Built at a reported cost of 1.6 billion shekels ($430 million), it was intended to stop militants, drug traffickers, and illegal migrants.The same year, Israel refurbished its outdated fence along the Golan Heights border with Syria with concertina wire, electronic sensors, and infrared cameras. With a long barrier already in place along the Lebanese border, that leaves only one section of Israels land boundaries unfenced  a section along the peaceful Jordanian border  and plans are under way to erect a barrier there as well.Just like the Chinese protected themselves and defended themselves with the Great Wall, so we will continue to defend ourselves on the southern border, the Golan Heights, and on all fronts, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a visit to China last year.The former lifeguards 14-year-old son has just finished the school day at Yad Mordechai, and jumps into the conversation with his father. The 1.8 million Palestinians living on the other side of the cement barrier just down the road are a distant memory for him. He was 5 when his family was evacuated. Like many young Israelis, he cant remember ever talking with a Palestinian face to face. He excelled in Arabic from seventh to ninth grade, but his school stopped offering it, and he lost interest.I dont hate Arabs. I hate Hamas, says the son, whose views are strongly influenced by militant videos hes watched on YouTube. One popular video, produced in Hebrew with a zippy soundtrack and fast-paced montages of Palestinian fighters attacking Israel, calls for the murder of all Zionists.They say, Clear out the beehive, like we are small bugs and they should exterminate us, he says.He has an animal-kingdom retort of his own, however.They are like a spiders nest.... If we dont clear the nest, they will keep spawning, says the son, who wants to go into the Israeli air force. For me, every day Hamas exists, its a day thats not safe for the people of Israel.His views have only been reinforced by the recent fighting in Gaza. One of the largest cross-border attack tunnels discovered by the Israeli military during the conflict ended in a leafy gully not far from the familys house in Netiv HaAsara, located right on the Gaza border, just south of Yad Mordechai. The family hurriedly moved about a week later to the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, into an unfinished home, where they slept on mattresses on the floor.There are some Arab people and Israeli people who want peace. But it wont happen, because of the terrorists, says the son. I think the only solution is [for them] to simply not do terror.The war marked the first time that Hamass rockets hit hard in Tel Aviv. Rocket sirens were an almost daily occurrence in the cosmopolitan city, whose beach and cappuccino culture had flourished largely undisturbed by the conflict for years.With the two populations so cut off from each other, Israelis  particularly the younger generation  often dont have a personal frame of reference against which to compare the rhetoric that arises during such crises.You dont see Palestinians, so you can envision them however you want, says Prof. Daniel Bar-Tal, a veteran political psychologist. The government also played a role, as it often does in times of conflict, in stirring up fears  especially about Hamass use of tunnels. I thought it was a fantastic idea, as a psychologist. Can you imagine zombies coming out of tunnels?... What people are afraid of the most is the unknown. It was really hitting exactly on this point.The Israeli government declared that eradicating Hamass cross-border tunnels was a chief goal of this summers Operation Protective Edge, launching a ground invasion that dramatically increased the number of casualties on both sides. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, including almost 500 children, according to the United Nations. Israel lost 67 soldiers  almost seven times as many as were lost in the last Gaza ground operation  as well as six civilians.While many Israelis were eager for the fighting to stop, some worried that the government didnt go far enough, leaving the country vulnerable to a repeat conflict within a few years. The Aug. 26 cease-fire agreement essentially reconfirmed the principles agreed to after the November 2012 conflict, which were not strong enough to prevent an outbreak of hostilities less than two years later.They should have come to a more substantial agreement, says Dalia Ben Haim, a Yad Mordechai resident who abandoned the leftist ideals of her youth after a Palestinian teenager killed her husband in 1992 while he was working in a Gaza greenhouse. The worst is to know that our soldiers are going to die  and it just increases our hatred toward Hamas.It was vintage Mr. Netanyahu: Speaking before the UN General Assembly recently in New York, he compared Hamas to the extremist Islamic State (IS) group. His presentation came complete with a photo allegedly showing a Hamas fighter beheading a man in orange garb.Critics have scoffed at Israels attempt to portray Hamas as seeking a global caliphate with equally brutal means as IS, arguing that its primary goals are nationalistic and focused on liberating historical Palestine from Israeli control. Yet many Israelis see the movement, whose charter calls for the diffusion of Islamic consciousness among the masses, both on the regional, Arab, and Islamic levels, as part of a regional upsurge in Islamist extremism, not just an isolated Palestinian group. It is another reason for the growing fortress mentality in Israel.The rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, of which Hamas is an offshoot, frightened many here, who were happy to see the military leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi oust the Brotherhood last year and ban it as a terrorist group. The ascension of militant Islamist groups in Syria, from IS to the Nusra Front, has added to Israeli jitters  particularly in the Golan Heights, where rebels recently took over the main Syrian city on the border.Along the northern border, Hezbollah is widely believed to have stockpiled as many as 100,000 rockets in preparation for its next conflict with Israel. With fears that Hezbollahs patron Iran could acquire nuclear-weapons capability, and use Hezbollah as a proxy against the Jewish state, Israelis see themselves on the front line of a potentially existential threat.Political scientist Abraham Diskin says that the regional atmosphere helps explain why Israelis are so pessimistic about the feasibility of a peace agreement now. At the height of the Gaza conflict this summer, the percentage of citizens who saw Israeli-Palestinian negotiations as a viable solution to the conflict hit a two-decade low, according to the Peace Index by The Israel Democracy Institute. The index, which measures both support for negotiations as well as expectations that they will succeed, dropped to 34.5 out of 100. That is roughly 20 points lower than at the height of the second intifada, during which Palestinians killed more than 1,000 Israelis, many in suicide bombings of cafes and buses.As more Israelis have become convinced that the Palestinians are not serious about ending the conflict, they have gravitated toward right-wing parties. The Jewish Home party, led by Naftali Bennett  a former settler leader who openly opposes Palestinian statehood  was recently ranked second in polls behind Netanyahus center-right Likud party. The atmosphere is more nationalistic, says Camil Fuchs, pollster for the liberal Haaretz newspaper. Up until elections eight years ago, we could see that in every election there is a chance of a change in government from right to center-left, or vice versa. Now it looks like the probability of government which leans toward center-left is ... close to zero.Netiv HaAsara, the community where the former lifeguard and his son used to live, feels almost deserted on a September afternoon. On the outskirts of the settlement, just 400 yards from Gaza, a truck full of Asian migrant workers crawls up a hill overlooking the charred remains of Palestinian apartment blocks. Tread marks in the dunes bear testament to the ongoing patrols of Israeli military vehicles.About 70 percent of the residents in these Israeli border communities evacuated during the war to escape the Gaza mortar fire and pounding of Israeli artillery, as well as the threat of tunnel infiltrations. Hamas attacked at least half a dozen border communities during the 51-day war, and more tunnels were found before attacks occurred, such as the one here in Netiv HaAsara.Some residents have decided to move for good. At the local post office, the bulletin board is crowded with for rent ads. One of the few visitors is local store owner Sharly Shabbat, who vows to stay in the area. He says he hasnt become more politically conservative, like many Israelis, but he is fatalistic about the possibility of peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians.Ive become more leftist ... not because I think theres a chance [of peace] but because I dont think you can solve it with fighting, he says. Im willing to do anything, but it doesnt seem like they [Palestinians] are willing to accept anything.... They want us dead.Dan Meridor, former deputy prime minister under Netanyahu, says after Israeli leaders took significant political risks to present major peace proposals to the Palestinians in 2000 and 2008, and were rejected both times, its understandable that there is considerable skepticism in Israel today.Still, some critics see racism rather than pragmatism driving a siege mentality. A forthcoming book, Scenes from School Life, depicts Israeli students who stand up for Arab rights as facing tremendous peer pressure, according to Haaretz.Im ready to kill someone with my hands, and its an Arab, said one student, adding her contempt for a girl who criticized those who want revenge against Arabs. As soon as I heard about the quarrel with that leftist girl, I was ready to throw a brick at her head and kill her. In my opinion, all the leftists are Israel-haters. I personally find it very painful. Those people have no place in our country  both the Arabs and the leftists.Whatever the precise motives behind it, the hardeningmind-set in Israel, as well as the increasing isolation of Israelis from their Arab neighbors, will make peacemaking more difficult, analysts say.It is also having an effect on business. As much as 40 percent of the Palestinian labor force once worked in the Israeli economy. Israelis took their cars to Palestinian mechanics, shopped for cheap goods in their souks, and flocked to Gazas beaches.But now Israelis are banned from entering not only Gaza but Palestinian cities in the West Bank, which are under the control of the PA. Within Israel, some 24 percent of Israeli Jews now say they are boycotting Arab businesses amid heightened tensions following this summers war, according to a recent Geocartagraphia poll.More broadly, some worry that Israels toughening stance in relation to its neighbors may be costing it abroad. While Israel has a fairly steady friend in the United States, some polls suggest worsening public opinion in Europe, a key hub for the boycott, divestment, sanctions movement protesting Israels treatment of Palestinians. A 2014 Globescan survey showed some improvement in global views since 2013, but roughly two-thirds of Europeans polled still said Israel had a mainly negative influence in the world, with Britain coming in at 72 percent  and that was before the latest Gaza conflict.None of this is to suggest, however, that many Israelis dont want a better relationship with their Arab neighbors. A recent survey by Mitvim  The Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies found that Israelis thought peace with the Palestinians should be one of the countrys top three foreign-policy priorities in the next six months: 62 percent said that better progress was needed on that front to improve Israels standing globally.And even if a peace deal isnt feasible right now, says Mr. Meridor, Israel can still take proactive steps that would give credibility to our position and our wish to have a Palestinian state. Those could include limiting settlement building to the major West Bank blocs and creating a de facto border beyond which Palestinians would be given greater authority.It may not be all in our hands to end the conflict, Meridor says, but if you cant end it in one step, try to move it in that direction."

RIDGEFIELD, Conn.  It started with a red light.In 2011 Ridgefield, Conn., resident Valerie Jensen was stopped at a traffic light on Prospect Street, just in front of an empty building. The brick structure had first opened its doors in 1939 as a movie theater. Years later it became a bank. But now the structure was to be razed.Ms. Jensen had a suddent inspiration for a different plan. At the time she was president of SPHERE, an organization that serves adults with developmental disabilities. She knew if she could persuade town planners to repurpose the building, she could give the adults she worked with a renewed sense of purpose.

Featuring first-run movies, the nonprofit movie theater provides educational and employment opportunities for adults with developmental disabilities. And with its caf,restaurant, and smartly dressed ushers, the theater harkens back to the golden age of cinema.We are returning the cinema to what movie going used to be like. People will be dazzled by the fantastic customer service. And with that I hope their attitudes will be opened and changed about hiring people with disabilities, Jensen says. We want to break the cycle of unemployment.Nearly 25 years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, unemployment of working-age people with disabilities remains high. More than 80 percent of people with disabilities are unemployed, according to September 2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.
At the Prospector employees are called Prospects. Thats because Jensen wants them to think of the theater as merely a stepping-stone to employment elsewhere.Our goal is to have people leave us, she says, wearing the same black trousers and T-shirt as all the Prospects.Of the theaters 70 Prospects, 16 work full-time and 54 work part-time. Those with disabilities receive additional job training.For example, Kris Mann works as an usher. He loves editing and so he works an hour or two a day learning photo editing. In this way the theater parallels a vocational school. Prospects may work the cashier for most of their day, but if they have an interest in art or cooking they can spend time each day trying out something different.Mr. Mann was working at Stop & Shop when Jensen approached him to apply for a job at the Prospector.We are different and we are better, Mann told him.The theater opened its doors Nov. 21 with screenings of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 and Interstellar. Screenings continue throughout the day.We want to break the stigma that movies are only for the nighttime, Mike Santini, the theaters director of development, says. Daytime employment is very important for those with developmental disabilities. They often dont have transportation to get to jobs at night.Mr. Santini, who was born and raised in Ridgefield, says hes excited to give back to his community.
We think we have something very special here, he says. Our goal is to create a unique experience, where everything is designed with our mission in mind.Indeed, the theater represents what happens when a community comes together.Doyle Coffin Architecture, a local architectural firm, designed the building and Raffaele Gallo, a local chef, created the menu. The stately red brick building now houses four theaters, a caf, and a restaurant. The largest theater seats 162 people, and the smallest seats 16 people.Everything was designed with accessibility, inclusion, and safety in mind.Railings run alongside every aisle, and in the two largest theaters the aisles are wide enough to accommodate motorized scooters and wheelchairs. Handicapped seats are scattered among regular theater chairs in every theater. This lets friends and family sit together. Closed captioning glasses for deaf and earphones with adjustable volume are available to those moviegoers who need them.In a nod to the theaters past as a bank, volunteers tiled the ceiling in the theaters Heads Up Caf with 27,000 pennies. The theme also speaks to the theaters mission.If you have a job your head is held high, Jensen says.Jensen hopes other communities will replicate the Prospector Theater model. It takes no government funding, operating solely on donations and the money raised from ticket and concession sales as well as renting theaters out for private functions such as birthday parties and corporate events.Shades of sapphire and emerald dominate an art print from The Wizard of Oz, which hangs in the theaters lobby. The Wizard of Oz was one of the first movies shown in the original Prospect Theater.The light and color of the film dazzled moviegoers, Santini says.

Washington  You cant run the government of the most powerful nation in the world on Wednesdays alone. Yet that is what members of Congress, in effect, are trying to do.Pulled in one direction by the ever-growing need to raise campaign funds, and pushed in another to avoid appearing disconnected from their constituents by spending too much time in Washington, they often arrive in the capital on Tuesday and go home on Thursday. This leaves them little time for deliberation and lawmaking.This has to change. Our institutions are not broken. We believe in and stand by our representative democracy as strongly as we ever have. The challenges themselves are not too great for us to overcome.

To that end, the House and Senate should adhere to full, five-day workweeks in Washington to provide enough time for legislative business. Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle should also maintain hot lines so they can discuss issues directly. They should hold regular monthly meetings with the president as well.

When a new Congress is seated after the midterm elections, these are just a few of the small changes we believe could go a long way toward changing the tone in Washington and restoring Congress to the democratic institution that once was the envy of the world.Todays Congress is almost unrecognizable from when we served as Senate majority leaders. When we led our respective parties in the Senate, we faced many unprecedented and difficult events. The nation was horrifically attacked on 9/11. Our government was threatened with the anthrax scare. We presided over the first evenly divided Senate in history. Congress impeached and tried the president. Yet we managed to balance the federal budget, add millions of new jobs, enact welfare and education reform, cut taxes, and safeguard drinking water. This despite divided party caucuses and bitter political disputes.We recognize that all was not perfect when we served and that the political atmosphere has changed since our days in leadership. However, despite these developments, our government must continue to work. It simply must adjust to this new political reality. We believe a few small changes will help restore functionality.The Bipartisan Policy Centers Commission on Political Reform, which we co-chair, recently made recommendations to improve all areas of civic life. These include addressing voting and election issues that improve the democratic process and calling for a one-year commitment to community and national service by our young people. Not surprisingly, congressional reform was a major aspect of the report. Some of these reforms are procedural, while others are cultural.Members of Congress and the president must renew a shared desire to get things done for the country. With that there needs to be a sense of comity and of reestablishing trust among our leaders. Vital to this are more open and frequent lines of communication among them. When we led the Senate, we had a hot line between the two of us so that we could discuss issues as they arose. When necessary, we held joint caucus meetings of all our members to address major issues such as 9/11, the anthrax scare, and the Clinton impeachment trial. These sessions were effective in building consensus, and we both wish we had held more of them.Republicans and Democrats should do more things together. At least once a month, joint party caucus meetings should be held in each chamber, and the congressional leadership should plan other informal gatherings of members from both parties to build relationships across the aisle.And the president must be a part of the solution. When we led the Senate, we met regularly with President George W. Bush. Scheduled monthly meetings between the president and congressional leadership would be helpful today. In fact, the president should attend joint congressional caucus meetings at least twice a year.Members of Congress spend relatively few days in Washington, and even then their time is not always spent legislating. In addition to adhering to a five-day workweek in Washington, we believe the chambers should establish concurrent schedules with three weeks in Washington and one week in states or districts.Changing the culture of Washington is only one of the necessary components of reform, though. Congress will also have to return to regular order if it is to tackle the nations problems. This means reinvigorating the committee process and allowing full deliberation of bills on the floor. It also means procedural changes that protect majority rule and preserve minority rights.Committees are an essential component of the legislative process. They allow for fact-finding, deliberation, and information-gathering that lay the foundation for good lawmaking. Committees foster compromise and provide rank-and-file members an opportunity to have more input on bills than they would otherwise. As of late, however, the committee process is circumvented and major legislation is brought directly to the floor for consideration.For Congress to work, its committees must work. Important legislation should not be brought to the floor in either chamber without first having the benefit of committee deliberations and a full report. Committee chairs must take a greater lead in passing authorization bills and ensure the views and ideas of all committee members have an opportunity to be heard and considered. Additionally, committees should be allowed to meet without interruption from business on the floor.Senate rules have been abused through overuse of the filibuster and other delay tactics by both parties, preventing even bipartisan legislation from being considered. One way to ameliorate this would be eliminating the filibuster on motions to proceed. This would allow the Senate to debate the issues themselves, instead of debating whether to debate, freeing up valuable floor time for other legislative business.Another problem is that members are often locked out of the legislative process because of procedural maneuvers that prevent them from being able to offer amendments. This tactic, called filling the tree, particularly prevents members of the Senate minority from having any influence on legislation. When we were in Congress, this tool was rarely utilized by the majority, whereas today it is used on almost every bill. A fair change would be to guarantee each party a minimum and equal number of amendments upon initial consideration of any bill.After the midterms, it will require leadership from both parties to put aside their tactics and partisanship and find common ground to move the country forward. While these recommendations cannot solve all of Washingtons current problems, they can have a profound impact and begin to put the country on a more productive path.Former Senate majority leaders Tom Daschle and Trent Lott now co-chair the Bipartisan Policy Centers Commission on Political Reform.- A former speaker of the US House of Representatives gives his thoughts on how to address the issue."

Perhaps.

The Christian Science Monitor,C,Why 20 year drop in crime is more impressive than it seems - CSMonitor.com,"class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				
Washington  The rate of violent crimes in the United States has been cut in half during the past 20 years.Thats according to statistics released in November by the FBI.What surprises some criminologists is that the decline has persisted against the backdrop of two other trends long believed to lead to an increase in crime: The US prison population is dropping and the number of young adults, who are considered more likely to commit a crime, has risen.

In 2013, the estimated number of violent crimes declined 4.4 percent, compared with the year before, according to FBI figures released in November.And the rate of violent crimes per 100,000 people in America has fallen to 368 per 100,000 US residents, down from about 714 in 1994.

The last time there were fewer than 400 violent crimes per 100,000 Americans was in 1971.Those numbers suggest that, even though declining crime is a long-term trend, the reasons for the drop have shifted.Criminologists say the latest gains against violent crime appear rooted especially in improved law enforcement, rather than a drop in the number of teenagers and 20-somethings.The community policing movement has brought beat cops into closer ties with the neighborhoods they serve, for one thing, and a data-driven focus on crime hotspots has led to successful prevention efforts in high-risk areas.Its certainly good news, and its largely a tribute to hard work by police chiefs as change agents across the country, says Scott Decker, a criminologist at Arizona State University in Phoenix.Among other factors contributing to the trend, Professor Decker says, are heightened efforts to prevent recidivism when inmates are released.Were paying increased attention to getting them ready to not offend when they get back on the street, he says.In fact, most US states have reduced incarceration rates and simultaneously reduced crime during the period from 2008 to 2013, according to analysis of government data by the Pew Charitable Trusts.States are continuing to defy the common assumption that crime would keep shrinking only if prisons kept expanding, Adam Gelb of Pews public safety performance project said in releasing the groups analysis last month.That notion  that crime can be controlled and even cut while reducing prison populations  is really starting to sink in with voters and elected officials, at a time when prison costs are a big part of strained state budgets, Mr. Gelb said.The total number of US prisoners has fallen since 2009, although last year had a small uptick (0.3 percent).For years, rising prisoner tallies and a decline in the number of younger, more crime-prone Americans were cited as important factors behind the drop in crime.Over the past decade, though, the demographic part of the equation has been nuanced, as the children of baby boomers swelled the ranks of teens and and 20-somethings. In 2010, for example, the number of Americans age 15 to 29 was higher by 6 million than in 2000, and also a bit higher when measured as a share of the total population.All this doesnt mean the gains against crime will continue uninterrupted  or that prisons arent important for reducing crime. The FBI figures show some up years for violent-crime rates (as recently as 2012) as well as down ones in the past two decades.Partly for state-budget reasons, the justice system is getting choosier about who gets put in prison.One of the most positive trends that you see in the United States ... is reserving those prison beds for either the violent or serious repeat offenders, says Joan Petersilia, a Stanford University law professor who helped California reduce its prison population.The strategy, she argues, can keep many low-level offenders from turning into repeat offenders.Some states have combined lower prison populations with increased efforts at rehabilitation, to reduce the likelihood of repeat offenses once an inmate is released.In Michigan, a prisoner reentry initiative helped lead to a roughly one-third percent reduction in parolees returning to prison in recent years. The program involves assessing inmate risks and needs, and helping to address them both during and after prison. Goals include helping former inmates to find jobs, housing, and counseling.Other states including Ohio and New York have been working along similar lines to help former convicts stay out of prison.Dr. Petersilias view, argued in a 2012 report, is that efforts to help former inmates with issues like jobs and drug abuse would pay for themselves by reducing future costs of crime, court proceedings, and prison terms.Beyond the incarceration trends, one of the stunning features of the recent fall in crime is that it persisted generally even during the deep recession of 2007 to 2009 and the tough economic times that followed. That may be a testament, in part to the rise of security cameras on stores and city streets.But it doesnt mean theres no tie between crime and economic conditions.Falling crime rates can help a local economy revive. Just consider the resurgence of Times Square and other parts of New York City in recent years. And more jobs and capital investment can fuel further progress against crime.That can go hand in hand with the policing efforts that will remain vital, experts say.Events this past year have shown how, despite nationwide efforts to integrate police into their communities, police in many neighborhoods still have a long way to go to build and maintain trust. Two key examples are the controversial deaths of two unarmed black men, Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York. Both mens deaths were caused by police officers and have sparked protests and loud calls for reforms of police use of force.A final caveat: Its important not to read too much into the headline crime numbers. Petersilia notes that prosecutors have been increasingly defining assault cases as misdemeanors, rather than felonies, as part of the effort to reduce prison populations. Those cases wont show up under aggravated assault, the largest category in the FBIs violent crime index.And significant criminal activity is now happening in cyberspace, in categories that dont show up in the FBI tracking, she adds. Despite the statistical question marks, though, she shares the view of other experts that violent crime has been heading downward."

				Thursday night's NFL game is a tale of two teams  one with a good shot of making the NFC playoffs and the other not quite eliminated from the playoff picture.The Dallas Cowboys, one game back in the NFC East, travel to Chicago to take on the Bears at Soldiers Field. The Bears are 5-7 this season and need to win all four of their final games to have even the slightest chance of making the NFL postseason.Chicago has proven weapons on offense. Quarterback Jay Cutler is the tenth-rated signal caller in the NFL, having thrown for over 3,100 yards and 24 touchdown passes. Running back Matt Forte has rushed for over 800 yards and has 650 yards receiving. Between them, wide receivers Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery have accounted for 125 catches, over 1,500 receiving yards, and 15 touchdowns. Jeffery, however, is questionable for Thursday night's game with a leg injury.

The problem for the Bears has been on defense. Chicago used to be known as the ""Monsters of the Midway."" The closest 'monster' these days is former All-Pro defensive end Jared Allen, who is second on the team in sacks with 4-1/2. So far this season, the Bears defense allows the opposition an average of 28 points per game. The pass defense is giving up an average of just over eight yards per completion by the opposition.

For Dallas, it's been a good season overall, resulting in an 8-4 record. However, after winning six of their first seven games, the Cowboys are 2-3 in their last five.Dallas running back DeMarco Murray continues to lead the NFL in rushing with 1,427 yards gained and eight touchdowns. With ten touchdown receptions this year, wide receiver Dez Bryant needs just 48 more yards to eclipse the 1,000-yard barrier for the third time in his NFL career. And quarterback Tony Romo can still throw to dependable tight end Jason Witten, who averages over ten yards per catch.Recently, the Cowboy defense has had some uneven performances, including an NFC East division loss at home last Thursday to the Philadelphia Eagles. They allowed Eagles running back LeSean McCoy to run for 159 yards and wideout Jeremy Maclin to grab eight passes for 108 yards. The Bears' weapons on offense will present yet another challenge to coordinator Rod Marinelli's crew, though he knows some of the cast after spending four seasons on the Chicago coaching staff.You can watch the Bears and the Cowboys on the NFL Network, beginning at 8:25 p.m. Eastern time Thursday."

""It's a cool place, a bit like Soho in New York,"" Huang Yu Han, a customer at the Taipei store told CNN. ""Many cool people hang out here. Some come here to read, others just to kill time and meet friends. It's like a place for modern culture and it's close to some of the best nightclubs and bars.""The 24-hour store at Taipei's Dunhua Road location has five floors, each dedicated to different categories, like fashion, music, food or events. Customers  which include both middle-aged literati and young hipsters  stand or sit on small steps, reading tables, or on the floor reading and chatting quietly as classical music emanates from speakers. Many stores also have small cafes and restaurants where customers can enjoy a book or hang out with friends.The five-story store opened its first branch in Taipei in 1989. Some 25 years later, it runs 42 stores in Taiwan, one in Hong Kong and has plans to expand in China, according to CNN.That, at a time when bookstores are closing in the US and UK.In 2011, bookseller Borders Books shut down its stores in the US. Barnes & Noble, the last major book retailer in the US, has been shutting down many of its stores as it struggles to compete with online rivals like Amazon.And in the UK, a third of all independent bookstores have closed in the last decade, according to the Booksellers Association.The Eslite Group, meanwhile, has reported revenues of $425 million in 2013, and sales are expected to increase by 8 percent this year.While everyone in the publishing world is going digital, Eslite credits its success to a return to books and connection.""It is our belief that the more digital the society [becomes], the more we treasure the warmth of the interconnection,"" company spokesman Timothy Wang told CNN. ""This core idea makes Eslite barely impacted by the changes of the industry.""Can Western booksellers take a page from Taiwan's booming book market?It's not clear the model would work here. For starters, some bookstores, like Barnes & Noble, have already begun focusing less on books and more on creating a comfortable environment for hanging out  much like the Eslite stores. Like Eslite, the chain's stores feature in-store cafes, soft music, couches, and children's rooms. They have also begun diversifying their product, with increasing amounts of floor space devoted to gifts, stationary, toys, and more.Eslite and Barnes & Noble share another common challenge: most customers enjoy the bookstore for hours, reading books, flipping through magazines, and meeting friends, eventually leaving empty-handed.""It's ... not clear whether the company will be able to replicate its 24-hour model outside Taiwan where the bookstores have become a cultural phenomenon,"" writes CNN.Nonetheless, we love the idea of an all-night bookstore-cum-lounge. It's innovative problem-solving like this that might help save our bookstores."

""When a 14-story building falls over, it's quite a belly flop.""When Space X is able to successfully land a rocket multiple times, the company will attempt to touch down on land. Musk says the next launch has a 50 percent chance of landing, but he said there is a 90 percent probability that one of thelaunches planned over the next year will be landed.Landing a rocket is crucial for SpaceX's mission of putting a sustainable human colony on Mars, something Musk said is like ""life insurance for the human race.""

On Sunday, five other men were arrested in the UK in what have become regular detentions of suspects, including five high-profile arrests in early October and nine in September.Two of the men arrested Sunday were found hiding among illegal immigrants in the back of a truck in Dover. One of them had been among the nine men arrested in September as part of a crackdown on the banned jihadi group Al-Muhajiroun, led by Mr. Choudary.Another of the Al-Muhajiroun group, Siddhartha Dhar, skipped bail after being released in September and joined Islamic State 24 hours later, according to the Telegraph:
Dhar, also known as Abu Rumaysah, took to Twitter last week to mock British security arrangements that allowed him to slip out of the country.The 31-year-old, who was a lieutenant of the hate preacher Anjem Choudary, also boasted having a child under the Islamic State and posted images of himself hold[ing] the infant and an automatic weapon.
He claimed to now be a citizen of the Islamic State, adding: What a shoddy security system Britain must have to allow me to breeze through Europe to the Islamic State.He said he had made a mockery of British intelligence and surveillance.
British authorities have identified the Welsh city of Cardiff as an especially ripe field for recruitment and transport to Islamic State battlefields, a ""hotbed,"" as one official put it, according to the Press Association. In recent weeks police have detained nearly a dozen young men in connection with efforts to travel and join Islamic State.The Press Association quotes South Wales Assistant Chief Constable Nikki Holland asking for support to help ""tackle ... extremism,"" and saying:
'I recognise the recent media coverage has raised very real concerns but I would like to thank and reassure the public that the links we have with our various religious communities remain strong and constructive.
'Following on from Counter Terrorism Awareness Week last week, which encouraged the public and businesses to be vigilant, I would like to ask once again for your co-operation and ask that you contact us if you know or suspect something.'"

Cairo  The announcement this week by Egypts deadliest militant group that it was behind the recent death of an American oil worker, coupled with claims it had assassinated several Egyptian security officials, seemed to confirm fears it was preparing to expand its operations after pledging allegiance to the Islamic State.Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (ABM), which so far has operated primarily in Egypts Sinai Peninsula, claimed Monday it was responsible for the August killing of William Henderson, a 28-year employee of Houston-based Apache Corp. His death previously had been attributed to a car-jacking.Mr. Henderson would be the first Western victim of a deadly ABM-spearheaded insurgency that has blighted Egypt for more than a year and has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Egyptian policemen and soldiers.

In fact, analysts suggest ABMs affiliation with its counterparts in Syria and Iraq is actually muddling the ultimate goal of harnessing the simmering anger of Egypts disaffected young Islamists.Weve seen an element of strategic dissonance in [ABMs] operations, especially in light of this affiliation says Mokhtar Awad, who researches Islamist movements for the Center for American Progress in Washington. He points to the fact that ABM is fighting a guerrilla war against the Egyptian state  a very different modus operandi to the one IS is fighting from the relative safety of its own territory in Syria and Iraq.Its IS, not its Egyptian counterpart, that seems to benefit most from this merger. It allows it to project an image of strength across the region at a time when US-led coalition airstrikes have halted or slowed its progress in Syria and Iraq.Egypt just can't be a jihadist sandbox like Syria and Iraq, says Mr. Awad. Much of its population of around 90 million people is apathetic or even hostile to the jihadists cause, and most Egyptians still remember the fear that accompanied militant violence throughout the 1990s.To overcome such hostility, ABM requires a level of strategy and commitment that no other group has managed to date, Awad says.Mostly restricted to SinaiFor now, this looks unlikely. Although ABM has claimed responsibility for sporadic attacks on the Egyptian mainland, most of its activity is still focused in the eastern Sinai Peninsula, where the group has been hemmed in by the Egyptian military.It does appear to have an operational cell on the countrys western flank, but it has only mounted a handful of attacks to date.ABM first emerged in 2011, training its firepower on neighboring Israel. But after the Egyptian militarys overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, the group has also launched a deadly campaign against Egypt's security services. Now, it says its fight is also with the Egyptian state.It mainly wants to be the group that takes ownership of the wider movement inside Egypt thats leaning toward violence and jihad, Awad says.After Morsis overthrow last year, the new government has mounted a searing crackdown against critics. Young Islamists have suffered most of all  thousands have been thrown into jail, and hundreds tortured in an off-the-books detention site near the eastern city of Ismailia.In response, some have grown violent, contributing to a fragmented nationwide insurgency that claims the lives of several security personnel on an almost daily basis.Appeal to Muslim BrotherhoodIn its public announcement of affiliation to the IS, ABM extended a call to arms for those young Muslim Brotherhood supporters who are tired of using ragtag peaceful protests as a sole response to Morsi's overthrow.""Humiliating non-violence will not be of use to you, nor heretical democracy, and you have seen what happened to its adherents,"" said ABM's statement.Egypts security services are doing their best to disrupt recruitment, and claim they have already shut down a number of ABM cells on the Egyptian mainland.Young men in Cairo and other large cities also have the option of joining a shadowy plethora of militant cells that are claiming attacks of their own.On a recent day in downtown Cairo, hundreds of locals crowded around the site of an alleged bomb, filming the spectacle on their camera phones. Is it Ansar Bayt el Maqdis? asked one teenager.His friends scoffed. Those Sinai men don't operate in these parts, laughed one.There are signs the group has begun to act opportunistically, focusing on its ability to project a show of force outside North Sinai, even if it brings few tangible gains.When a Salafist group called its youth cadres to take part in nationwide protests last week, ABM exploited the situation for its own ends, assassinating policemen in the heart of Cairo and in a next-door governorate.We promise our people in Egypt more operations, and we say to them that there is no glory for you but with jihad, the group later wrote on its Twitter account.PR as part of Islamic State's MOExperts say, meanwhile, that the exact narrative behind William Hendersons murder is also questionable  some suggest it is more likely to have been carried out by smugglers, who sold the oil workers identification documents to ABM.According to Aaron Reese, deputy research director at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, ABMs sudden flurry of announcements could well be encouraged by the Islamic State.This is a group thats now likely to favor a good deal of public activity on ABMs part, he says. Even if we dont know what impact the merger has had on the ground, this builds the impression that their merger was a success."
The Weekly Standard,C,The Benghazi Whitewash | The Weekly Standard,"
On Friday, November 21, the Republican-majority House Intelligence Committee released a report about the CIA and the intelligence communitys conduct in the terror attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. The report uncritically accepted the CIAs defense of its conduct, and so reporters hastened to accuse previous Republican inquiries and hearings into Benghazi of being illegitimate political theater. National Journals Ron Fournier said the GOP should be ashamed. Politicos Michael Grunwald said the report suggested Benghazi wasnt really a scandal. The Atlantics Conor Friedersdorf suggested audiences of conservative sites [should] express anger at being misled about Benghazi for so long.It would be nice if the journalists using the report as a cudgel read the thing. The report is for the most part more damning than the gloss reporters are putting on it. And the parts that arent damning are a classic Washington whitewash. It is in no way a complete overview of all that happened on that fateful day of September 11, 2012, nor does it review the conduct of everyone involved. And one of the central facts confirmed by the report is an indictment of the mainstream media coverage of Benghazi. (Heres one of the things that should have tipped off reporters about the weaknesses in the report: It unironically uses the phrase mistakes were made on page one.)

So what does the report get right? To start with, last December the New York Times ran a lengthy piece the paper claimed was based on months of investigation, concluding there was no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault and it was fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam. This conclusion was preposterous, and The Weekly Standards Stephen Hayes (as well as our contributor Thomas Joscelyn) quickly debunked it. Nonetheless, this remained the official version of events right up until hours before the House report dropped confirming that, yes, Benghazi was an al Qaeda attack and, no, it had absolutely nothing to do with a video. That morning, the Times revised its version of events. But soon, everyone in the media was too busy wrongly using the report to shame Republicans to note the stunning journalistic failure.
And notably, the report reviewed only CIA conductit did not review the State Departments actions (or lack thereof). The report notes, The State Department had contracted with the February 17th Brigade to provide security in Benghazi. Interestingly enough, the report does not note the full namethe February 17th Martyrs Brigade, or that the group is now allied with Ansar al Sharia, which led the attack that night. It would be nice to know more about how this security decision was made, but if the media asked reasonable questions it might put a damper on publishing op-eds from Clintonistas such as Lanny Davis demanding the GOP investigate itself in the wake of the report. Team Hillary is hoping the report will divorce Hillary from any responsibility for the Benghazi tragedy. It assuredly does not.
Finally, the report details a disconcerting version of events showing how the Obama administrations Benghazi talking points were crafted in a highly politicized and flawed process. If you think the administration denied known facts about al Qaedas involvement in favor of blaming a YouTube video, attacking the First Amendment, and putting the presidents reelection above the truththe report lends credibility to this version of events. The report has numerous other problems (The Scrapbooks friend Mollie Hemingway published a 6,000-word account at the Federalist of 20 ways the media completely misread the report, and she was only summarizing). The Scrapbook encourages you to read the report for yourself. Heaven knows the media have no plans to bother.

The Weekly Standard,C,Old-Time Religion   | The Weekly Standard,"
Despite its rather contrived title, this is a fine book: extraordinarily learned, exciting (most of the time), and beautifully written. There is already an enormous body of writing about how English Catholicism survived the tidal wave of the Protestant Reformation under Elizabeth, but this study must have a special place therein.The Gunpowder Plot conspiratorsMary Evans Picture Library / Everett Collection It centers on one distinguished Roman Catholic dynasty: the Vaux (pronounced Vorx) family of Harrowden Hall in Northamptonshire, which, along with Huddlestones, Treshams, Catesbys, and dozens of othersmany of them linked by marriageformed the backbone of Catholic recusancy (i.e., non-conformity, from the Latin recusare: to refuse). Recently ennobled at the time of the Reformation and well connected, the Vauxes were a good choice. But, as it happens, they had already been biographed by a very distinguished historian of recusancy, Father Godfrey Anstruther, in the 1950s. His is a learned and lively book, and it should have received more recognition in this one. But this is an even better bookeven more lively and learned, and a historiographical age away from its predecessor. So, yes, we needed it.
And what a story it tells: plots and counterplots, assassinations and Armadas, horrendous torture and unspeakably gruesome executions, stinking prisons, secret messages written in orange juice (invisible until heated), spies and traitors and clandestine printing presses. Hollywood could not have made it up.  

Jessie Childs is not Roman Catholic, but she is remarkably fair and astute in her judgments and (though she should not say that Catholics believe that the Eucharistic presence is a physical one) has a deep understanding of Catholic culture. She understands how bewildering it was for Catholics to find that the faith of their forefathers (and of English kings and queens since time immemorial) was now treason and that they apparently had to choose between queen and popelet alone between queen and the king of Spain, who conveniently believed that Holy Mother Church was best served by Spanish imperialism.
Childs also understands how the arrival in England of the refugee Mary Queen of Scots, that most fatal of fatal women and immediately the centerpiece of Catholic plots against Elizabeth, heightened the dilemma of those Catholics who wanted to be both loyal subjects and loyal to the faith. She explains well how a Catholic family like the Vauxes could be constantly fined for nonattendance at their parish church, in and out of prison for their recusancy, excluded from the universities and professions, unable to travel, and subject to the sudden siege and ransacking of their house by sheriffs and their men (plus sniffer dogs) searching for priests in hides in attics and stairwellseven sewers.
There are saints and sinners galore. There is Henry Vaux, devout son of the third baron and no mean poet, wholly dedicated to serving the young Jesuit mission to England, launched in 1580. There is Ambrose Vaux, his stepbrother and a swashbuckling tearaway. There are those astonishing Jesuits: dazzling Edmund Campion, of course, sometime tutor of that same Henry Vaux; John Gerard, the only man ever to escape from the Tower of London; Henry Garnet, superior of the Jesuit mission and one of the Society of Jesus most admirable English sons, a martyr who was never canonized and is subject to exact probing in this book. Then there is the sadist Richard Topcliffe, who delighted in racking Jesuits almost to death and who seems to have made a young Catholic female prisoner pregnant. He also (can this be true?) claimed that he was wont to pleasure sexually the queen herself.
It is three other women, Anne and Elizabeth Vaux, daughters of that same third baron, and Eliza, their stepsister, who steal the show. Unmarried Anne gave her all to caring for Garnet, moving with him as he bolted from one safe house to another in order to elude detection; Elizabeth, a fiery widow, was another devotee of Garnet and mother of a zealous Catholic family; Eliza, no less committed, was a particular associate of John Gerard. All three were hunted down and suffered for their faith. Anne spent time in the Tower of London, and Eliza was sent to another London jail, the Fleet. They were not the only ones. As the author explains, women played a crucial role in the story of this underground Catholicism: harboring and succoring the missionary priests, guarding Mass vestments, portable altars, missals, and relicsand, above all, catechizing their children and even their servants.
Holy women had hitherto usually been nuns or hermits. Now it was laywomenvirgins like Anne Vaux, as well as mothers and wives presiding over Catholic householdswho led the way, and were even being martyred.

The Weekly Standard,C,Uncommon Ancestor  | The Weekly Standard,"
As the theological undercurrents of the present Middle East turmoil roil ever closer to the surface, well-meaning observers in the West have increasingly looked toward a common biblical ancestor to heal conflict among Muslims, Christians, and Jews. Bruce Feilers bestselling Abraham: A Journey to the Heart of Three Faiths (2002), for example, reassures us that despite the violence, the misunderstanding, and the history of reinterpretation that attends his name, Abraham still is the root of our common heritage and the example for reunion among his children.Similar strains of universalism, sometimes embellished with apologetics, have more recently been sounded in the academy. In announcing Oxford Universitys new chair in Abrahamic religions, Professor George Pattison of the theology faculty said, Jews, Christians, and Muslims all refer to Abraham as a friend of God, and I hope that the establishment of this important post will contribute to deepening friendship amongst these three great religions in their diverse quests to honor God rightly.
But Carol Bakhos of UCLA, in her lucid new book, challenges the notion that the first patriarch can be so innocuously pressed into the service of interfaith reconciliation. This understanding of Abraham, she argues, is rooted neither in Scripture nor in early interpretive traditions but rather in the rhetoric of twentieth-century ecumenical advocacy of religious tolerance and understanding.
As Jews, Christians, and Muslims forged their respective faiths, Bakhos writes, each evoked and defined itself against the figure of Abraham, who is described in Genesis as father of a multitude of nations. She opens her nuanced reading of those traditionseach of which claims to be the sole authentic heir of Abrahams legacywith a simple question: Exactly what is Abrahamic about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam? 

In Genesis, Abraham is the forefather of the Jewish people, a 10th-generation descendant of Noah who is singled out as the bearer of an unconditional covenant which will be that peoples most precious patrimony. This first patriarch exhibits great faith (heeding Gods command to leave his native Mesopotamia and his fathers home for an unknown land), bold compassion (arguing with God to spare the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah), and profound hospitality (welcoming strangers).
Yet Bakhos notes that nowhere does Genesis depict Abraham as arguing with pagans and idolaters. He never fulminates against false gods or rival deities. Neither is he a teacher or proselytizer. Nor, with the exception of circumcision, does he observe Mosaic law. In fact, the ultimate act required of him, the sacrifice of his son, is the very command that cannot be universalized into law.
Such stories come later, when the rabbinic tradition begins to grapple with the early Christian critique of law. Only in the imaginative literature called midrash does Abraham smash his fathers idols. Only in the Mishnah, the earliest compilation of Jewish law, is he said, with some anachronistic license, to have practiced the entire Torah before it was given.
In Genesis, however, what matters above all is the question of successionand it isnt a question that portends well for interfaith dialogue. Ishmael, Abrahams firstborn (and the subject of an earlier book by Bakhos), is banished. By the early Middle Ages, Bakhos writes, the rabbinic imagination had identified Ishmael with Islam. Isaac, the younger son, is chosen to carry on the covenantal line. If anything, Bakhos writes, this is one instance of how well-meaning talk of confraternity maintains deeply entrenched misconceptions of Islam, and on some level aggravates the very antagonism it hopes to ameliorate.
If the Jewish Abraham founds a nation, the Christian Abraham undermines the theological significance of nations themselves. If Judaism represents Abraham as the first partner of Gods unretracted promise, Christianity understands him (and his family) as foreshadowing the fulfillment of that promise and the culmination of the covenant. 
Take, for instance, his willingness to sacrifice Isaac. Paul declares that God, like Abraham, did not withhold his own Son. (In the Korans account of this paradigmatic gesture of submission to Gods will, the son Abraham intends to sacrifice goes unnamed, and early Islamic exegetes disagreed about whether it was Ishmael or Isaac.)

The Weekly Standard,C,Virginia vs. the EPA? | The Weekly Standard,"
The Obama administrations recently announced Clean Air Act power-plant rules, advertised as helping to control the greenhouse gases that cause climate change, have almost nothing to recommend them. Complex, clunky, and burdensome, theyre likely to spike energy bills while doing almost nothing to control pollution or stop global warming.Sic Semper TyrannisGeorge WytheDespite some pleasant-sounding talk about flexibility and choice, as currently drafted, the rules offer states few options beyond heavy-handed command-and-control oversight of fixed source carbon-dioxide emitters (coal-fired power plants and the like). Even the awful Waxman-Markey cap and trade bill that passed the Democratic-controlled House in 2009 suspended authority to issue regulations like the ones the Obama administration has now imposed.
Thats why its more than a bit heartening that a few states are fighting back in a constructive way, one that neither accepts the administrations bureaucratic meddling nor ignores greenhouse gas emissions. In language that only a bureaucrat could love, the Commonwealth of Virginia has asked that it be allowed to interpret 40 C.F.R. 60.21 and 60.24(b)(1) permit 111(d) emission guidelines to . . . devise broader, more creative, and more effective options to address compliance from affected [power plants] than now contemplated. The EPA, Virginia says, should also remove any doubts that novel approaches will be encouraged and accepted.
In plain language, this is an important if cheeky request: If the EPA will allow it, Virginia regulators would like to kick the agency out for all intents and purposes and replace command-and-control regulation with a better system of its own devising.

While a piecemeal state-by-state approach probably doesnt make for the best possible economic policyeconomists from both the left and right agree it would be better to tax greenhouse gas emissions at a single national ratethe politics of what Virginia may want to do are great. With one fell swoop, state officials could kick out federal regulators, end the burdens they impose, and follow any number of courses, ranging from the states own carbon tax (which could be used to cut other taxes) to a lighter-handed, more localized approach to regulation. Having such options is particularly important to Virginia, which, under Democratic and Republican administrations alike, has done a lot to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions in ways that current centrally planned rules just dont acknowledge.
Virginia is currently under a Democratic governor who implicitly accepts that the Obama administration is trying to confront a real problem, albeit in a ham-handed way. Thus, the Virginia approach isnt likely to win many conservative plaudits. But if the EPA can be convinced to say yes and allow Virginia to go forward, it will present a path that turns a burdensome regulatory framework into an opportunity for policy innovation.

The Weekly Standard,C,The Laughs on Us  | The Weekly Standard,"
This past summer, as I sat in a movie theater about to watch Girl Shy (1924), a nine-decade-old comedy starring Harold Lloyd, I wondered what the uninitiated audience would think. This was a silent movie, and it isnt easy to trade spoken dialogue for pantomime. And then there was the star of the production: Although Lloyd is my own favorite of the silent comic actors, to utter his name to most people under the age of, say, 70 is to risk the rebuttal, Harold who? Yet, in spite of everything, Girl Shy worked, both for me and, judging by their laughter, for many others in the audiencemost of whom, to my eyes, were under 70. Our laughs were hearty, unfaked, unironic.Harold Lloyd (center) in Girl Shy (1924)NEWSCOMI was pleasantly surprised, then, to find an approving mention of Girl Shy in this all-inclusive guide to purportedly pass humor. American Cornball marches through dozens of topics (alphabetically arranged) that, its author argues, were long ago grist for Americas comic mill but are no more. These topics include cops and nightsticks, hats, womens, henpecked husbands, and midnight snacks. Girl Shy comes up in the entry on nincompoops. Therein, Miller tange-tially discusses the adjective bashful when used to refer to male shyness vis--vis women, and Girl Shy, with its central characters reticent stance towards the opposite sex, fits the bill. 

Although Christopher Miller claims to appreciate humor that deviates from what he calls the usual joke about men and sex ... that its all men think about, he admits, earlier in the same sentence, that jokes lobbed affectionately in the direction of bashful males are seldom very funny. Tell that to the audience who guffawed at Girl Shy. The somewhat shaky premise of American Cornball is that most of the comic categories it discussesromantically timid bachelors among themhave lost their capacity to bring forth laughs. Some are still good for a laugh, Miller writes, but few are as funny as they used to be, and the most laughable thing about many is that people did once find them funny.
To be sure, Millerblessed with seemingly limitless recall of not just movies but comic strips, postcards, and wisecracks from the first half of the 20th centuryhas produced a fair share of clunkers to back up his assertion. The laughter-inducing properties of, say, Limburger cheese or old maids have certainly dimmed with time, and Miller is right to remind us how much blatantly racist and sexist humor was once in general circulation. On the other hand, to leaf through these pages is to be reminded of American humors ample treasures, many of which have aged rather well. There is enduring wisdom in Preston Sturgess 1941 litany for comic success, quoted here, in part: A kitten is better than a dog. A baby is better than a kitten. A kiss is better than a baby. A pratfall is better than anything. Dont these preferences still hold true?
From time to time, Miller goes against his premisethat much of the humor he describes is dmodand lets his enthusiasm get the better of him, as when he recounts the abundance of tumbling anvils in 1950s Looney Tunes cartoons. Going! Going! Gosh! (1952), for example, features Wile E. Coyote aloft in a weather balloon, with anvil in tow. But after he lets go of the anvil, with Road Runner below, the balloon deflates and the coyote and his garbage cart plunge groundward, passing the anvil on the way down (because, as the Ninth Law of Cartoon Physics mandates, Everything falls faster than an anvil). Naturally, the anvil strikes Wile E. Coyote.
No matter the decade, it would seem, anvil-based gags (like piano- or safe-based gags, also discussed here) are reliably riotous.
So are pie fights, which Miller writes about with similar thoughtfulness and appreciation. Discussing the supersized pie fight included in the Jack Lemmon/Tony Curtis farce The Great Race (1965), Miller notes that when an already-pie-spattered character is struck repeatedly, the joke loses its punch: Thats why the director, Blake Edwards, waits till the end of the scene before the charmed, immaculate, white-suited Tony Curtis is finally pied.

The Weekly Standard,C,Highly Recommended    | The Weekly Standard,"
If you need a break from the noxious violence in the daily news and find yourself searching for a recuperative nighttime read about the loony haplessness that is the byproduct of a free and prosperous culturewell, you can do no better than to curl up with this ingeniously conceived, wickedly funny, and ultimately very moving epistolary novel.
It consists entirely of LORs (letters of recommendation) written by the curmudgeonly, almost-dead white male Jason Fitger, a tenured professor of creative writing and English at Payne University (Teach til It Hurts). Writing departments tend to be universities drainage pans, catching the lost, the unusual, the unadjusted, and, occasionally, the brilliant before they are washed out into the great sea of sink-or-swim. (Full disclosure: I spent eight years in MITs writing program.) For many of these students, Professor Fitger is the last port of call. 
Fitgers LORs, shot out in desperation toward such alien domains as The Paintball Emporium and Wexler Foods, are lifelines attempting to secure entry-level, part-time jobs and unpaid internshipsor, when they are addressed to a university office, under-funded fellowships and adjunct lecturerships. Here is a letter to Kompu-Metricka:
Ms. Vanessa Cuddigan has asked me to submit a letter of reference to your poorly spelled organization. While I have only praise for Ms. Cuddigan, who graduated two years ago with a major in English, I had expected her to ask that I recommend her for graduate school. Instead, having completed a stint with Teach for America, she is now apparently desirous of some sort of data-entry position at your firmclearly a soul-squelching enterprise. I have asked her to explain herself but she is evasive, leading me to wonder if something unfortunate happened during the two years to destroy her ambition. 



Fitgers two letters recommending (a) a psychopath and (b) a girl dissolved in tears to the mental health intervention team scrape the bottom of the barreland are so close to what we know to be true that its hard to remember these are satires. But Fitger also gets to see the top: the indefatigable Vivian, who applies to law school, medical school, Yaddo, and, finally, to Fitgers own literary agent in an attempt to finagle a six-figure advance for her coming-of-age story purportedly narrated by the first genetically engineered human-feline cross (specifically, a human/cheetah).
The unflappable Tara, a plagiarist, shows up on January 7:
Ms. Tara Tappani knocked at my office door this morning, and, with the air of a woman wearing diamonds and furs, entered the icy enclosure in which I work, perched at the edge of my red vinyl chair, and urged me to respond to your second e-mail request for a recommendation, as she dearly hopes to be hired as assistant editor of Sellebritta Online. I demurred. Pressed, I reminded Ms. Tappani that a year ago I gave her a well-deserved F in my Intermediate Fiction class. She chuckled and put a mani-cured little paw on my forearm, as if the two of us were sharing a wonderful joke. Dont worry about that, she assured me. I just need a letter.

The letters alone would be tremendous fun, because Schumachers social details are dead-on and her timing for punch lines is impeccable. But there is more. As the letters progress, Fitgers biography comes into focus, exposing the ruthless egocentricity of a young writer on the make. He and several of the women to whom he must now write LORs on behalf of his students were once members of a fabled literary seminar whose leadera cross between Lionel Trilling and F.R. Leaviswas a kingmaker because his brother was an editor at a New York publishing house. Young Fitger clawed his way to the top, and got his novel published. But his creative streak has petered out; he is divorced, abandoned, teaching Paynes lost souls, and longing to get back together with his ex-wife.
When Dear Committee Members opens, we find Fitger installed in a drafty office next to the leaky mens room, writing LORs that are honest to a fault, matching the flaws of the applicant to the flaws of the place requesting the LOR. The letters show, in their quirky way, Fitgers deep understanding of human misery; they add up to his best work yet. Moved by the fates of two of his students, one young, one aging, Fitger composes ever more desperate letters to secure funding that would enable them to finish their respective novels.

The Weekly Standard,C,Outer Borough Tales    | The Weekly Standard,"
On the third page of We Are Not Ourselves, it is said that Big Mike lives in an apartment on whose walls the only piece of art is a painting of St. Patrick driving the snakes out of Ireland. If not a friend to the world of fine art, Mike is a great friend to his fellow Irish immigrants in Woodside, Queens. On stools and from behind the bar, he holds forth on matters great and small, helping this one with marital advice and that one with a job. A mans man with an over-the-top personality, he is never subtle, and author Matthew Thomas does not treat him with subtlety.Mikes wife is another striking character from this now-faded generation: intelligent, cynical, and occasionally cruel. Also an immigrant and also a drinker, she is angry and disappointed at her low station in life, but, like the growing length of ash on her cigarettes, she is something to behold. After Mike confesses to a big gambling loss, she takes retribution by choosing someone else to sponsor her citizenship. When the deed is unveiled, he is flabbergasted.
Dont ever love anyone, she tells her daughter, Eileen. All youll do is break your own heart.
Young Eileen becomes a caretaker to her mother, whose disappointment leads to full-blown alcoholism. The girl is initiated in the rites of drinking too much and pouring out ones woes in bitter streams of words. Like many Irish-American women, Eileen goes into nursing, a profession unequal to her worldly ambition, which, after she marries, seeks expression in her own family. 

So go the first 50 or so pages of one of the most celebrated novels of the year. Filled with countless authentic touches from the outer boroughsthe roads, the towns, the shifting mix of ethnicitiesand from the periods through which the story passes, We Are Not Ourselves is a testament to the authors patient in-gathering of details. The social history underlying this book is well-considered and worthy of attention; but the accumulation of facts, at times, feels defensive, and adds to the novels halting progress. After a bold beginning, the mood and pace are sometimes more reminiscent of an Irish funeral than an Irish wake.
The family at the center of this debut work is atypical in some respects. Eileen and her husband Ed Leary have only one child. Ed is a scientist with an academic career, teaching at Bronx Community College. He puts his students before himself and rejects offers of more money and prestige elsewhere. But Eileen is still the daughter of immigrants. The American Dream of a big house and a fast car holds a mighty grip on her imagination. And the consolation prize of a middle-class life full of integrity is hard to savor when your heart is still shopping for a four-bedroom Tudor in Westchester.
The other perspective character, besides Eileen, is her son Connell. He is the smartest kid in class and, outside of it, one of the most despised. With a best friend named Farshid, he grows up in a different Queens than the one Eileen knew as a child, which doesnt preserve him from reckless, childlike versions of the petty bigotries that help shape his mothers thinking. If there is a major flaw in this novel, it is here: A facile moralizing creeps into several moments of ethnic and racial tension. A writer from an earlier generation might have inserted a great deal of sex to make his characters come alive; this one seems to think his characters would seem unreal without repeated dabs of crude bigotry.
Ed, however, is far too high-minded for such nonsense. He dislikes the Christmas windows on Fifth Avenue, insists on offering support to underdogs, and seems to actually believe that there is no reason to move out of Queens, while all around them Eileen sees a rising brown tide of hostile immigrants. A devout Mets fan, Ed would be too good to believe except that he is mentally slipping, and, rather sadly, he seems to know it. What begins as a big ethnic novel turns, early on, into a family drama driven by Eileens will to get out of Queens and Eds fast-developing Alzheimers.
Matthew Thomas develops numerous excellent scenes throughout. Some of the early repartee between Ed and Eileen delightfully captures the tension in their not-always-harmonious views on life. One night, when Eileen is short-staffed at the hospital, she finds herself searching the floor for a lost pill only to discover her bed-ridden patient transfixed by the sight of her attractive posterior. As Connell grows up, he cluelessly backs himself into adulthood, unconsciously undoing much of the effort expended on his behalf by others.

The Weekly Standard,C,Political Care Package     | The Weekly Standard,"
Conservatives are reptiles. This is the message that progressive talking heads and Democratic campaign consultants heave at Americas impressionable swing voters: Conservatives are cold, lethargic, calculating creatures who peer out at the world through diamond pupils in swampy green eyes, and who can be roused to motion only by the sight of something worth devouring.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the marchExpect to hear that refrain delivered more and more often as Republicans take control of the Senate early next year. For no matter the subjecthealth care, food stamps, immigration, marginal tax ratesthe preferred insult for conservatives these days is not that theyre wrong, or misguided, or even stupid. Its that theyre cruel.
We live in an age of conspicuous compassion. Modern White House aides earn their salaries scouting the most dejected victims to adorn the next press conference or State of the Union address, and woe betide any politician who fails sufficiently to demonstrate his sympathy for the wretched and the disaffected. One of the more chewed-over statistics from the 2012 election involved what more than one pundit termed the empathy gap. Exit pollsters for NBC gave voters four options for the quality that most affected their choice of candidate. Mitt Romney handily won Americans looking for a man who shares my values, is a strong leader, and has a vision for the future. But more than a fifth of the electorate was most interested in having a president who cares about people like me. Barack Obama won that group, 81-18.
Republicans have two options for dealing with such a problem: the easy way, and the right way. 

The easy way is to soften the GOPs image. Find the partys most proficient brow-furrowers and stage a few photo ops where they can shake hands sympathetically with pensioners. Talk less about tax cuts and more about tax credits. Maybe recruit a few professional actors. The right way is to harden the electorate, attack the premise, convince voters that public empathy is a poor yardstick for choosing officeholders and government policies. This is, of course, a longer project, and a more difficult one.
But William Voegeli, senior editor of the Claremont Review of Books, has done yeomans work with The Pity Party. He methodically demonstrates that a political movement built on empathy leaves its adherents leaning haphazardly on a rickety pile of unexamined assumptions and logical leaps. As he points out, theres a reason why Aristotle examined compassion, which we treat as a moral virtue, in the Rhetoric, discussing it solely in terms of the power to move an audience. He does not mention the subject in the Ethics or the Politics.
Since the emotional calculus involved in snap decisions is unknowable, we shouldnt be surprised that, when politicians do the math of pathos, they never seem to come up with a limiting principle. Every problem is as tragic, urgent, and worthy of action as every other. Consider this gem of an argument Voegeli pulls from Matt Miller at the Washington Post: If you feel its urgent to help the victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, then deep in your heart you also support Obamacare. The line is funny because it proves too much: Matt Miller might just as easily have compared hurricane relief to taxpayer-subsidized automobile insurance or federal research on Exploding Head Syndrome. What he really means is: Here are two causes that only a monster could oppose.
Once ingrained, this kind of thinking leads to a society that (as Voegeli puts it) cares less about actually helping others than it cares about caring. Public compassion becomes an end in itself, and the machinery of government is simply a means of catharsis. Hence, the people who push the hardest for expanding government programs are the ones least interested in whether the programs actually work. Confront a progressive friend with a few statisticsthe study that suggests patients on Medicaid fare even worse than those with no insurance at all, or the paper that shows enrollment in Head Start makes zero long-term difference to students academic successand he will reply, almost without fail, that the problem is funding. If only we had more dump trucks to ferry pallets of crisp 100-dollar bills from the Federal Reserve to various federal offices.
All this emoting leaves little room in our public discourse for much elsesay, for example, calm examination of moral hazards or unintended consequences. President Obama once quoted the late movie critic Roger Ebert in a speech, saying, Kindness covers all of my political beliefs. A conservative is likely to suggest that this explains the problem precisely.

The Weekly Standard,C,The Reacher File   | The Weekly Standard,"
Supersleuths in the mode of Sherlock Holmes, Lord Peter Wimsey, and Hercule Poirot are an endangered species. With scattered exceptions, the Great Detective has fallen out of fashion in favor of mere smart peopledriven cops, dogged private eyes, curious amateurswithout special deductive powers.Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher (2012)Holmes and Poirot are always with us. The Baker Street master is reimagined each year by various hands, and the fussy Belgian has a new case in Sophie Hannahs The Monogram Murders, authorized by the Agatha Christie estate. (The result is ambitious and well-meant but ultimately unsatisfactory: If Christie had any plots as far-fetched as this one, she could at least make them believable in the reading, which Hannah does not.)
The original books by Christie and Doyle live on, but where are their contemporary successors? One of them has come to the mystery masquerade in the most deceptive of disguises, as a writer of action thrillers: Lee Child. And the 21st-century Sherlock Holmes is a six-foot-five bruiser named Jack Reacher. 

Child, an Englishman who worked in television before turning to novels, now lives in the United States and nails the American idiom. His character shares his outsider viewpoint. Reachers childhood as the son of a well-traveled U.S. Marine, and his equally nomadic adult career as an Army military policeman, have made him a stranger in his own country. Retired with the rank of major, he is a happily homeless drifter, constitutionally unable to stay in one place for long. Fully exploring his home country for the first time, he takes odd jobsbouncer, swimming pool diggerand avoids possessions. He wears one set of clothes until he throws it away, and then he replaces it with another. He is unfamiliar with, or wary of, everyday accoutrements (bank accounts, credit cards, mortgages) that others take for granted, but he is incomparable at helping people in danger and at solving problems through his physical and mental prowess.
The Reacher novels have violent action, beautiful women, lovingly detailed weaponry, sexual encounters, macho confrontations, daring rescues, and James Bondian assaults on the bad guys lair. But they are much more than mere thrillers. They are a rarer and finer thing: classical detective stories.
Killing Floor (1997) introduced Jack Reacher in the first-person narrative format Child says comes naturally to him, though he uses the third person for its suspense-building advantages in most later novels. While having a late breakfast in a diner after a long walk in the rain from the highway to a small Georgia town, Reacher is arrested for murder. He stays mute while mentally grading the cops performance. Later, he treats the local detective to his first series of pointedly Sherlockian deductions: I know youre a Harvard postgrad, youre divorced and you quit smoking in April. He can explain it all, of course, and, in a situation somewhat reminiscent of John Balls In the Heat of the Night, he goes from wrongful arrestee to police consultantexcept that here its a white detective advising a black local lawman.
Though one early review described Reacher as creepily amoral and decried the level of violence, most greeted the novel for the landmark it was. Tersely told, with a plethora of short sentence fragments, the novel includes a great Hitchcockian suspense scene in an airport baggage claim area, as well as a fairly clued puzzle plot, with an ingenious punctuation clue the Ellery Queen team would have loved. There is also a subtle Sherlockian parallel: Like Holmes, Reacher has an even smarter brother. Joe Reacher, similar to Mycroft Holmes, works in government and is unknown to the general public; but his accomplishments as a Treasury agent include getting rid of all American counterfeiting.
Some have fairly criticized this first outing for coincidences and plot lacunae; but with it all, Lee Child was a great mystery writer from the first. Later novels would be slicker, but this one must stand as one of the genres best debuts.

The Weekly Standard,C,A Visual Dialogue  | The Weekly Standard,"
Few books of late have pleased me as much as this one. Whether it will interest anyone else is an open question, but it might, and it should. In essence, this book consists of an ongoing dialogue between two very cultured men, Philippe de Montebello, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Martin Gayford, former art critic for the Spectator. The pair meet periodically in the great museums of Europe and America and discuss Old Master paintings. Sometimes, it is true, they range more broadly, with interesting things to say about Greek vases, Assyrian reliefs, and Gothic statuary. But the bulk of their conversation is devoted to Titian, Velzquez, Rubens, and Goya, as well as to many lesser-known masters of ages past.Philippe de MontebellonewscomThe most surprising thing about Rendez-vous with Art is that it exists at all. In the past decade, the museum worldreflecting the shifting interests of the publichas become strangely fixated on contemporary art, with an appreciable diminution of interest in most everything else, not least the Old Masters. When these do receive attention, especially from publishers, the focus usually turns to megastars like Leonardo, Vermeer, or Michelangelo, and the results tend to be silly and irrelevant. How welcome, then, that these two men are so unapologetic in their appetite for older art, and that they exhibit such admirable depth and sensitivity on the subject. They speak with as much discernment about the Master of Moulins and Antonello da Messina as about Rubens and Poussin. 

Let it also be said that they make for an appealing, if unlikely, pair. In contrast to de Montebellos imperious prolixitya quality that will be familiar to all who have had dealings with him at the MetGayford is soft-spoken, self-effacing, and economical in his responses. This is true to such a degree that many passages read as though Gayford were interviewing de Montebello; indeed, as though he were James Boswell to de Montebellos Samuel Johnson. Yet both have valuable things to say, and because Gayford writes the prose that initiates and concludes each dialogue, he has the last word.
The mere act of devoting a book like this to Old Master paintings, or in any case to pre-19th-century art, suggests an almost polemical conservatism. In this context, de Montebellos outspoken insistence on such superannuated notions as quality and authenticity is almost unheard-of today. Indeed, in the service of these ideas, he expresses himself in a manner so true to himself that, were a playwright to put those same words in his mouth, one might reject them as heavy-handed caricature.
At one point, as the two men are walking around Florence, they come upon Giambolognas Perseus. Uncertain whether it is the original, de Montebello explains, I not only dislike, but also disapprove of, being unsure. Elsewhere, in comparing a Boucher and Fragonard in the Wallace Collection, he says, Well, you know my proclivity for hierarchies, so Ill say right off that this Fragonard is one step up from a Boucher. I would conjecture that that is the first and last time in the past half-century that anyone in the art world has used the word hierarchy by way of approbation.
Later on, as they stand in front of Rubenss Three Graces (1630-35) in the Prado, de Montebello exuberates in the language of a glorified docent: I just love the opalescent flesh tones of these luxuriant nudes, the nacreous reflections on the skin. At the same time, however, he reveals himself to be a master of blunt Anglo-Saxon, as in this priceless exchange (with which I fully concur) about the Muse du Quai Branly, the museum of primitive art on the Left Bank of the Seine:
Gayford: Its a labyrinth. So it suggests confusion. Were lost in the forest of a postmodernist architects imagination.
De Montebello: I hate this place.

But beyond such deft character strokes, this is a deeper and far more valuable book than, perhaps, I have suggested. Both men have thought long and hard about art and museums, and their book presents the fruits of such reflection. We learn, for example, that de Montebello has a blind spot for Turner, that he becomes less interested in Dutch landscapes with each day that passes, and that he was initially bored by Greek vases. What is interesting about these admissions is that any critic in the broader sense, whether of art or literature or music, has just these pockets of inattention regarding what he knows he is supposed to admire, and may indeed acknowledge to be admirable, but which he simply cannot find it in himself to enjoy. Yet one rarely hears anyone confessing to such things as candidly as de Montebello does here.

The Weekly Standard,C,Voice of Experience | The Weekly Standard,"
I've lately had the pleasure of being interviewed on John Batchelors cerebral radio program, which originates in New York but is heard all over the country. Since I am in Washington, and not New York, I speak to Mr. Batchelor by telephonewhich means that his millions of listeners hear but do not see the person identified as Philip Terzian. I may well be the only one of his guests who thinks about such things, but theres a reason.Gary LockeAlmost exactly 40 years ago, when I was employed as a baby editor at another magazine in Washington, its small but ambitious book division reprinted a collection of short stories by Mordecai Richler (1931-2001) entitled The Street (1975). Richler, the Jewish-Canadian novelist and essayist, was then at the height of his renown, largely based on the 1974 movie version of his 1959 novel The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.
There was a very modest authors toura series of radio and television interviews in Washington and Baltimoreand it was my job to collect Richler at his hotel and ferry him from venue to venue in my Fiat. So nave was I at the time that it never occurred to me afterwards to seek reimbursement for gas and mileage, or for the lunch I underwrote, during our literary journey. But I was interested to spend a day in the company of a famous novelist, and curious about the rituals of TV and radio interviews.
Since our first appointment was in Baltimore, I collected Richler at the Madison Hotel in Washington very nearly at dawn. He looked like the proverbial unmade bed: His clothes were loosely worn and appropriately rumpled, his face was pasty, and his hair unkempt. It was obvious that he welcomed neither the task at hand nor the hour of day; but to his credit, he spared me blame and faced our schedule not with anger but resignation.

I was embarrassed by the fact that I had neither read nor seen Duddy Kravitz; worse, I was unaware of Richlers having lived until recently in London, which would have given me a conversational gambit. But no matter: As we drove out of Washington and onto the Capital Beltway, he stretched out as much as possible in a Fiat and dozed off. I remember when the giant Mormon Temple loomed into viewit had just been constructed, and as the sun rose was bathed in unearthly lighthe awoke with a start, and we laughed together.
The first interview was on an early-morning television talk show. Richler was not happy about the prospect, and I didnt know what to expect. The interviewer was one of those well-groomed TV types with mellifluous voice and unctuous manner. But he taught me an important lesson about appearances: The interviewer seemed to have actually read The Street, and his questions were intelligent, respectful, and shrewdly designed to draw out his reluctant subject. It was one of the better interviews of the day, perhaps the best.
What Richler made of all this I cannot say, for he tended toward monosyllables and preferred, in my case, to talk of other things. But I know that he was angered, at one point, by an interviewer who accused him of abetting antisemitism with his working-class, sometimes-less-than-heroic Jewish characters.
He handled such questions, I should say, with practiced skill; but they might well have bothered him more than I perceived, for at the first opportunity during a break between appointments, he insisted that we find a place to get a drink. I cannot now remember the hour of the morning, but it was well before lunchtime, and my appetite for alcoholnever strongwas nonexistent. I smiled and chattered away self-consciously while Richler consumed a giant Bloody Mary.
And that was the pattern for the balance of the day: interview followed by cocktails followed by interview. I remember that he was asked questions by a youthful Maury Povich, and was joined in the studio by the New Yorker writer Michael J. Arlen, plugging Passage to Ararat (1975)followed by drinks. But with one more radio interview, by phone, to go, Richler informed me that he just couldnt do it, and insisted that I transport him back to the Madison.
Which I did. This left me with no choice but to save my own job. I drove back to the magazine offices in Washington, closed my door, dialed the number of the station in questionand identified myself as Mordecai Richler. The interview was brief and slightly nerve-wracking, but comparatively easy: I had listened to the same questions and answers for hours and, if I may say, did a fair imitation of Richlers low-pitched voice. I am happy to report that when Richler heard the story, a quarter-century later, he remembered nothing. But he laughed.

The Weekly Standard,C,Extending Extensions  | The Weekly Standard,"
Predictably, President Barack Obama and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei have decided to extend again the Joint Plan of Action, the interim nuclear deal they concluded in November 2013. Unlike the last extension, which was for four months, this one is for seven months; the political parts of the deal, Secretary of State John Kerry assures us, should be done by March, while further technical and drafting details may take until July.Oh, the complexity: Foreign Minister Zarif of Iran and Baroness Ashton  of the European Union with John Kerry, November 24NewscomThis is an odd situation: Obama agreed to the first, shorter extension last July, when little progress on the big issues had been made. Yet after 10 rounds of negotiations and numerous side meetings, in which, per Secretary Kerry, progress was indeed made on some of the most vexing challenges that we face, we now need a longer extension? This is necessary, the secretary suggests, because the great progress made is just so complex that it requires, as he put it, an incredible amount of rigorous technical analysis of concepts.
Let us suggest a different narrative. More time is required for more complex negotiations because the Obama administration continues to make concessions to the Iranians that it attempts to justify with technical alchemy. Let us look at centrifuges, perhaps the hardest technical issue.
It really wouldnt require long, rigorous negotiations if the American position were still the position the Obama administration inherited from the U.N. Security Council when it came into office: no enrichment of uranium. If Tehran could not maintain a single cascade of centrifuges to produce fissile material in bomb-grade quantity or stockpile enriched uranium, either as a gas or a reversible solid oxide, sufficient for a single nuclear weapon, matters would be relatively clear.

Constraining uranium enrichment becomes more complex when Washington starts conceding to the clerical regime thousands of centrifuges and a larger uranium stockpile. When Khamenei declines our offerswhich it appears hes done repeatedly since November 2013President Obamas response has been to allow Iran more centrifuges or SWUs (meas-ures of uranium enrichment). Both Western and Iranian media report a current American benchmark of around 4,500 machines; Revolutionary Guard-affiliated media have mentioned 6,000 centrifuges.
The recently leaked American plan to leave several thousand centrifuges spinning but disconnect the piping for most of the cascades at the Natanz enrichment sites and mothball these excess centrifuges was a pristine example of American technicians and diplomats trying to work around the supreme leaders literalism. Since Khamenei had declared that not a single machine could be dismantled, then why not aim at the piping that makes a cascade? Such a plan could, of course, easily become a minefield of technical abuse. With the nuclear infrastructure of Natanz essentially intact, Iranian engineers could rapidly reconnect newer, much more efficient machines, thus presenting the United States with a shorter break-out time for a bomb.
Iranian press reports suggest that the piping proposal (fortunately) didnt pass muster. It appears the supreme leader, who when it comes to all things American is neither curious nor forbearing, wasnt sufficiently impressed. We hadnt conceded enough. Its a good guess that however many centrifuges wed conceded as of November 24, the old deadline, the number will be increased in the next seven months, further complicating the challenge of devising a way to give Khamenei what he wants while maintaining a modicum of American integrity.
And whats so complex and time-consuming about the heavy-water reactor at Arak? If it is converted to a light-water reactor, as the United States and Europe have requested, the extraction of plutonium becomes a very difficult task (though inspectors would still have to monitor closely the extremely hot, but extractable, spent fuel). Arak only becomes diplomatically complex and time-consuming when the Iranians refuse to accept this downgrade, thereby preserving the possibility of more easily producing a weapon. The plutonium path to an A-bomb has probably been a secondary concern for Iranian nuclear engineers since the clandestine facility was revealed in 2002, as a plutonium break-out is difficult to conceal. And yet the Iranians have proven decidedly obstreperous on Arak.

The Weekly Standard,C,French Curtains | The Weekly Standard,"
French readers follow the herd. They believe in prizes. When a French author wins the Goncourt or the Nobel, people rush to bookstores and send his books rocketing to the top of the bestseller lists. But today the French have other things on their minds. President Franois Hollande is Frances least popular leader since World War II. His poll ratings are even lower than Barack Obamas. A gay marriage law he rushed through the National Assembly in 2013 has continued to bring enraged (and previously apolitical) protesters into the streets in 2014. Hollandes Socialist party lost 150 cities in last springs municipal elections. In elections for the European parliament, which took place at about the same time, the National Front became Frances largest party. The working-class group, long tarred as fascist, took twice as many seats as the Socialists, who fell to third.Eric ZemmourNEWSCOMAlthough the French novelist Patrick Modiano won the Nobel in October, he has lately been bumped off the charts by Eric Zemmour, a talk-show pundit who is persona non grata among the countrys intellectual establishment. Zemmours Le suicide franais (Paris: Albin Michel, 534 pages, 22.90 euros) is made for the moment. It argues that, since the French student uprising of May 1968, womens libbers, Muslim migrants, crooked bankers, and overzealous judges have brought France to ruin. To judge from the reaction to Zemmours bookwhich sold a quarter-million copies in the fortnight after publication despite furious condemnations in all of the daily paperslarge parts of the French public think he is right.

It is tempting to look at Zemmour as a television hothead in the Bill OReilly mold. He is that, at times. But his book has a great ambition, too. As Paul Johnson did in his magisterial Modern Times (1983), Zemmour takes a half-century of events that have been shrouded in progressive clichs and places them in a more logical relationship. His method is the one that historian Richard Reeves uses in his biographies of U.S. presidents. Zemmour will take an episode in Frances political or cultural life, describe the long train of events that made it possible, and extrapolate to its consequences. These are generally episodes that show the French choosing to do away with something they had formerly cherished: the release of director Bertrand Bliers sexual picaresque Les valseuses in 1974; the 1993 law abandoning the list of approved (usually saints) names that had been in force for two centuries; President Jacques Chiracs abolition of military conscription in 1996; the introduction of affirmative action in one of Frances elite universities that same year; the booing of the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, by North African immigrant spectators during a game against Algeria in October 2001, weeks after the attacks on the World Trade Center; the lack of any commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Austerlitz (1805), perhaps the greatest victory of Napoleon, who until that point had been revered almost as a demigod in French popular culture; and so on.
Zemmours idea of France is built around its great nation-builders: Richelieu, Napoleon, and above all General (later president) Charles de Gaulle. It was de Gaulle who rescued French honor after the countrys surrender and occupation in World War II and unified the postwar nation around a narrative of its fight against the Naziseven if that narrative was mythological, the fight having been in large part confined to Communists, various Christians, and the general himself. De Gaulles conservatism was different from conservatism elsewhere. He was attached more to the grandeur of the French nation, less to liberty and small government, and he neither admired nor trusted the United States. After his death in 1970, French politicians made their peace with the free market and a less ambitious view of their countrys destiny. Its intellectuals came to treat their fathers as a bunch of collaborators. Zemmour now sees the post-de Gaulle consensus as an unpatriotic sellout. We were taught to love what we used to hate, he writes, and to hate what we used to love.

The Weekly Standard,C,Hope and Glory  | The Weekly Standard,"
This book is something of a Rube Goldberg machine. Its author, Time theater critic Richard Zoglin, makes enormous claims about the cultural importance of his subject: He calls Bob Hope the entertainer of the century, the first person to be a star in every medium, the man seen by more people in person than anyone else in history, even the inventor of stand-up comedy. But the book that contains these claims is so turgid it belies them. No one who was supposedly so central to the life and times of the 20th century could have been this uninteresting, on stage and off.Bob Hope 1938nbc / getty imagesZoglin must have thought he had hit biographers gold when he took on the job of serving as Hopes first serious posthumous chronicler; but after years of prospecting, hes dug up very little thats shiny from a very deep mine. On the surface, Hope lived an extraordinarily long and fantastically colorful life: He was born poor in England and struggled in America, spending years wandering around the back alleys of the Middle West on the vaudeville circuit before breaking big on Broadway, and then becoming a star on radio, in movies, and on television.
He risked his life to entertain troops over the course of five wars and four decades, and he came to know just about everybody there was to know on the planet during his lifetime. But Hope had nothing interesting to say to themor, later, about them. He was a wonderfully smooth singer and dancer, but not especially notable at doing either. He was a movie star who made a dozen major hits that all melted into air the second the audience was finished watching them. He rattled off literally tens of thousands of one-liners as perfectly as they could be delivered. And not one of those jokes survived his death at the age of 100 in 2003. 

What surrounded Hope was the birth, adolescence, and maturation of popular culture in multiple media. He did surpassingly well in all, but did nothing groundbreaking in any. Zoglin describes Hopes skits on stage and over the air, all his movies, his television shows, his monologues, his Oscar-hosting, his guest bits, and various side jobs, in granular detail. But so few of them come across as especially amusing that one finishes reading Hope: Entertainer of the Century baffled rather than enlightened about his durable fame. Surely someone who cast such a large shadow ought to have been memorable, somehow. Zoglins book spends so much time on how well this movie did and how well that TV special rated that one suspects hes trying to convince himself Hope is worth the grind.
Bob Hope was a star for 40 years and a legend for 30 more, and through it all, he skated on the surface as no one has done before or since. He was all technique, no substanceas a performer, perhaps the most superficial star who ever lived. The same seems to have been true about his private life. He had few close friends; even he and Bing Crosby, with whom he formed the original buddy-comedy team, kept each other at arms length. He was a pretty good boss, but not a great one, and he would complain about reimbursing taxi fare. He was married for 70 years to the same woman, with whom he adopted four children. He was a distant father and a decent brother, neither particularly loving nor notably unloving, and a relatively prudent husband.
Though he had many affairs, he did everything he could to spare Dolores (and himself) the indignity of public exposure and was the subject of only two scandal-sheet exposs about his wanderings over the course of his career. The most horrifying detail in this book is one that Zoglin, who is anything but a sensationalist, simply tosses off: Three of Hopes long-term mistresses eventually committed suicide. Surely this speaks to a darker quality in Hopes character, an attraction toward the self-destructive or a tendency to enable self-destruction. But if so, trying to make sense of it is beyond Zoglins capacities as a biographer.
So is taking proper account of the formidable grey matter Hope clearly possessed. Zoglin mentions in passing that Hope had a photographic memory and that, until his faculties began to fade, he knew every joke he had ever told, and where he had told it. He also had an ability to recall names and faces over the space of decades, a talent any politician would envy.

If a cultured American is one who can hear the William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger, then an educated Briton is someone who gets the jokes in 1066 and All That, W.C. Sellar and R.J. Yeatmans 1930 pastiche of patriotic legends and schoolroom clichs. In that loving spoof, history is the struggle of the English to become top nation. All actors and events are judged Good or Bad. The Roman Conquest, for example, was a Good Thing, since the Britons were only natives at that time. GeorgeIII was a Bad King, but to a great extent insane and a Good Man. The French Revolution started out very interesting and romantic, but turned into a Bad Thing: the executions and purges, the 20 years of war as the French exported their interesting and romantic idea, and the imperial rampage of Napoleon Bonaparte.Andrew RobertsSebastian Meyer / CorbisAndrew Roberts surely knows his Sellar and Yeatman. He also knows his Gibbon and Churchill. Roberts is a storyteller in the old style, a sweeper of epics and a buckler of the swash. His books include The Storm of War (2011), an acclaimed history of the Second World War, and paired biographies like Churchill and Hitler (2003) and Napoleon and Wellington (2001). Fond of an intellectual punch-up, Roberts has defended the Raj and Mrs. Thatcher as Good Things, and argued that Neville Chamberlains foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, was a Good Man. Here, he attempts the contrarians equivalent of invading Russia: rehabilitating Napoleon as the Enlightenment on horseback. This is a little like calling Hitler modernity in a tank, or FDR liberalism in a wheelchair. It begs the question: Was it a Good Thing that Napoleon tried to make France Top Nation? 

Born in 1769, the driven and intelligent son of a distressed gentleman of Corsica, Napoleon was a professional soldier, but an amateur politician. Educated at a military academy and commissioned as an artillery officer, he was slow to see the potential of the French Revolution, but caught on quickly as it turned into a European war. Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia ganged together against revolutionary France, and most of Napoleons fellow officers were royalists. Napoleon capitalized brilliantly on these opportunities for gloire. Winning fame for an artillery action at Toulon, he was a brigadier general by 1793. In 1795, aged 25, he rendered himself indispensable to the revolutionary regime by wafting a whiff of grapeshot towards the mob outside the Paris legislature.
After that, Napoleon rose like a rocket, a new technology whose battlefield use the aristocratic Duke of Wellington thought unsporting. He restored his familys fortunes as he ascended the ladder and, as the new commander of the Army of the Interior, married Josphine de Beauharnais, a planters daughter from Martinique whose first husband had been guillotined during the Terror. In 1796, Napoleon launched the first modern war. He was expert in logistics, and he was the first commander to use a chief of staff. This professional discipline permitted a different kind of fighting: Rapid, multi-prong-ed flanking movements converged in a merciless concentration of force, a head-on collision on his terms. The Austrians surrendered before he took Vienna.
Napoleon glossed his legend for domestic consumption by sending fictionalized bulletins to Paris. His men loved him but spoke wryly of lying like a bulletin. Napoleon believed his own mythology. To emulate Alexander and eviscerate the British Empire, he turned to India. Landing at Alexandria with Egypts first printing pressstolen from the Vaticanhe declared himself a Muslim, then smashed the medieval army of the Mameluks at the Battle of the Pyramids. But another professional, Admiral Lord Nelson, cut Napoleons supply line at the Battle of the Nile. Napoleons Indian dream sank with his fleet, and he abandoned his army in the desert.
Still, the French acclaimed him as a hero. Joining the Consulate, the ruling triumvirate, he soon rose to first consul. In 1800, the Austrians returned to the field. A lucky victory at Marengo forced the anti-French coalition to the table. The Treaty of Amiens gave Europe two years of peace, but it collapsed when Napoleon excluded Britain, the chief funder of the anti-French coalition, from the European economy. Nelson again thwarted Napoleons global plans at Trafalgar; but on land, Napoleon smashed the Russians and Austrians at Austerlitz, and the Prussians at Jena.
When asked to name the greatest captain of all time, Wellington replied, In this age, in past ages, in any age, Napoleon.

Journalists, academics, and clergypeople alike went all aflutter for months speculating whether Dan Browns blockbuster 2003 novel The Da Vinci Codewhich also unites Jesus and the Magdalene in wedlockcould have a grain of truth to it, and what it would mean for the future of Christianity had its founder, traditionally regarded as celibate, turned out to be not so.
Early in 2014 the results of carbon-dating tests revealed that the piece of papyrus wasnt so old as King had thought (it dated from the 8th century, nowhere near the time of Jesus), and many scholars concluded that King had been duped by a modern forger who had copied some words from another ancient text onto the tiny fragment. King herself, while continuing to maintain that the writing was genuine, withdrew her assertion that it referred specifically to Mary Magdalene.

But at least Kings papyrus scrap did use the words Jesus and wife in the same sentence. The Lost Gospel is a far more ambitious attempt to cater to peoples willingness to believe what they want to believebecause the supposed lost gospel that Jacobovici and Wilson say they have uncovered never actually mentions Jesus at all. Nor Mary Magdalene. Furthermore, as Robert Cargill, a professor of classics and religious studies at the University of Iowa put it in a scathing online review, Mr. Jacobovicis The Lost Gospel is neither lost nor a gospel.
Instead, it is a well-known ancient text that scholars call Joseph and Aseneth because its two leading characters are the biblical patriarch Joseph and his bride Aseneth, briefly mentioned in the Book of Genesis as the daughter of an Egyptian priest and the mother of Josephs two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Joseph and Aseneth elaborates on their courtship and wedding, which includes the pagan Aseneths conversion to belief in the God of Israel. No one knows exactly when Joseph and Aseneth was writtenperhaps as early as the first century b.c. or as late as the second century a.d. Most scholars believe that its a Jewish text, written to explain how it happened that a pious Hebrew patriarch married a pagan woman. But some scholars think the romantic tale has Christian overtones, including references to bread and wine that might be allegories of the Christian Eucharist. Manuscripts of Joseph and Aseneth, believed to have been originally composed in Greek, have been surfacing since the 19th century. The version that Jacobovici and Wilson claim to have unearthed, a 6th-century manuscript written in Syriac, a Middle Eastern dialect related to the Aramaic that Jesus probably spoke, has been on the shelves of the British Library since 1847 (gathering dust is the way the two put it, although that manuscript has in fact been extensively studied).
No matter. Jacobovici and Wilson claim to have decoded the manuscript by substituting Jesus forJoseph and Mary Magdalene for Aseneth. There is now written evidence that Jesus was married to Mary the Magdalene and that they had children together, they write. During the missing years of Jesus life before he began his public ministry, he became engaged, got married, had sexual relations, and produced children, Jacobovici and Wilson say.

The Weekly Standard,C,No Deal | The Weekly Standard,"
So the November 24 deadline for reaching a comprehensive agreement with Iran over its nuclear programitself an extension of an earlier deadlinehas come and gone with a whimper, and with another extension. The frenetic, feverish, and foolish pursuit of a deal by the Obama administration, marked by one concession after another to Iran, raised the real possibility that the United States and its international partners would make a historically dangerous mistake that could ensure a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran in short order. It was something of a relief when Iranian obstinacy again saved the day, and the parties in Vienna merely agreed to extend the talks.A missile on parade in Tehran, September 2013NEWSCOMThe focus in America quickly shifted to sanctions, and whether the deterioration of the sanctions regime engineered by the Obama administration a year ago could be halted, and sanctions now strengthened. We strongly support an urgent congressional effort along these lines. But its also time to step back and ask how we got to the point where the United States is begging a third-rate power like Iran to make a deal that undermines our strategic interests and those of our allies. Maybe its time to learn the lessons of years of diplomatic failure and adopt a new Iran strategy.

The chances of achieving an acceptable deal with Iran were always remote. It was always unlikely that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would accept anything short of complete American capitulation, given that hostility to the Great Satan is central to his regimes raison dtre. Still, diplomacy was perhaps worth pursuing up to a point. The United States had a strong hand to playa vast network of regional military assets and allies, some ability to cripple Iran economically, and the capability to destroy Irans nuclear infrastructure, if it came to that. Iran, meanwhile, has a strong terror network and a growing missile force, but an unimpressive military, few regional allies, and many powerful foes, while being dependent upon energy exports to support its economy and rule of terror.
When President Obama began his diplomatic efforts, he pledged his readiness to use all elements of American power to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. But he then spent years undermining the credibility of this pledge, and thus undermining what leverage the United States had with Iran. He unilaterally and voluntarily turned a reasonably strong hand into a weak one.
Obama seemed to believe the key to resolving differences with Tehran was to allay Iranian suspicions. So in 2009 he wrote a letter to Khamenei. That same year he failed to support the antiregime demonstrators who rose up following Irans fraudulent presidential elections. By 2014, Obama was still sending letters to Khamenei, pleading that Iran work with Washington. These entreaties were ridiculed by Tehran and interpreted as supplications from a weak and declining power.
Similarly, Obama failed to confront Iran or its allies in the region. Especially noteworthy was his refusal to support moderate Syrians in their uprising against Bashar al-Assad or to do anything subsequently to undermine Assads rule, even after saying in 2011 that the Syrian dictator had to go.
At the same time, Obama distanced himself from Israel and Americas traditional Arab allies, all ardent foes of Iran. Senior Obama officials had secret talks with Iran over its nuclear program in Oman without telling the Israelis or the Saudis. And Obama went out of his way to pick public fights with the Israelis and demonstrated a general lack of concern for the security of Arab allies. All of this emboldened Iran in its dreams of regional hegemony.
Furthermore, the Obama administration often didnt seem serious about its claim that it was committed to preventing a nuclear Iran, raising suspicions that its true policy was one of containment. In 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested consideration of a regional nuclear umbrella, implying the United States was prepared to live with a nuclear Iran. Even when administration officials spoke about prevention, they spoke only of stopping Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon, instead of nuclear capability.
Meanwhile, Congress did force the imposition of tough sanctions, causing Irans oil exports to plunge and its economy to contract. Sanctions may have brought Iran to the negotiating table, but they have failed in their main purpose: stopping the nuclear program. And when President Obama foolishly relaxed the sanctions regime in January 2014, U.S. leverage virtually disappeared.

The Weekly Standard,C,Marion Barrys Legacy | The Weekly Standard,"
The death of Marion Barry last week inspired all the usual observations: that he was the son of a Mississippi sharecropper; that he was a veteran, albeit a minor one, of the civil rights movement; that he was better known for his scandals, as mayor of the District of Columbia, than for his achievements, such as they were; that he had a fervent following in the community that remained loyal unto death; that once, in his 1980s heyday, he pronounced himself mayor for life.DB KingThe Scrapbook has always assumed that the last self-description was delivered tongue-in-cheek, but with Mayor Barry, you could never be sure. Indeed, from The Scrapbooks perspective, the enduring significance of Marion Barry has little to do with the man himself and everything to do with the cause he championed through four tumultuous mayoral terms: statehood for Washington, D.C. If Barrys life and work has any historic resonance, it is the incontrovertible fact that the city of Washington, D.C., will never become a state of the union. Congressional Democrats may support that idea, and Democratic presidents (Carter, Clinton, Obama) may pay lip service to it; but it wont happen. And Marion Barry explains why.
The nations capital, defined by the Constitution as the seat of the Government under its federal enclave provision, is in reality a middle-sized city which has shrunk in acreage since it was founded, and in population (646,000) since the 1950s. It is true that residents of the District have but one nonvoting representative in Congressalthough one could argue that it is represented by Congress as a wholeand that their self-government is limited by the jurisdiction of Congress. But no one is obliged by law to maintain residency in Washington, D.C., and there is little sentiment outside the metropolitan area to bestow statehood status on a midsized metropolis whose principal industry is politics and government.

The only reason anyone outside of Washington ever heard of Marion Barryor was aware that the District of Columbia has an elected mayorwas his well-publicized misconduct in the 1980s and 90s. America has its share of buffoonish public servants, and the occasional politician-criminal; Barrys distinction was the special embarrassment his misdeeds attached to the capital of the United States of America.
He was neither the first elected mayor since the District of Columbia was granted limited home rule in 1967, nor was he the first African-American mayor. But he was, thus far, the only one to spend time in prisonand in so doing, kept the notion of statehood for Washington, D.C., off the table, probably for good.

The Weekly Standard,C,Hartache | The Weekly Standard,"
One month short of his 78th birthday, and 27 years after his self-immolation, Gary Hart has been given a present of sorts by writer Matt Bai, who in All the Truth Is Out recasts the past as Hart wants to see it, a great man brought low by a change (for the worse) in the national zeitgeist that deprived the United States of a truly great leader, and a great mind of its mission in life.Barack Obama in Berlin, July 2008NEWSCOMThis isnt the first time that this take has been venturedthe late Richard Ben Cramer made Hart the hero of What It Takes, his 1992 door-stopping account of the 1988 presidential race and its many participantsbut this is the first stand-alone effort, and also the first to be seen against the backdrop of the collapse of the presidency of Barack Obama, who is in some ways a Hart-like politician, though their failings are not all alike. Whatever his faults, Obama would have dropped dead many times over before he posed in a Monkey Business T-shirt with a blonde in his lap, but as political phenomena they share some points of contact: the phenomenal rise, the aspirational note, the appeal to the hopes of a new generation, and the claim to great brains plus the stylistic appeal of a pop culture icon, which played to the wish of a key demographic to be trendy and grave at one time. Each got his start in the Iowa caucuses, when he sandbagged an older and more baggy-eyed veteran presumed to be the frontrunner: Obama in 2008 when he stunned Hillary Clinton, and Hart in 1984 when he finished second to former vice president Walter F. Mondale and went on to savage him in New Hampshire only a few weeks after that. What else and what more may they have in common? Let us go back to that long-ago season, to look for what we can find.

To begin with, each burst on the scene as a quasi-messiah, a sage and a rock star in one. Hart is no longer simply a candidate. ... He is a political phenomenonin part a craze, but also something beyond that, wrote Elizabeth Drew in the New Yorker on April 12, 1984. Nothing like what has happened in the past week has ever happened before in American politics. No candidate has ever been so quickly transformed into such a political force ... or become the -subject of so much excitement. ... The very fact that numerous people now tell reporters they favor Hart even though they dont know much, or even anything, about him, is part of the phenomenon. He is young, good looking and fresh, and offers himself as someone who will change the old ways.
Does this sound familiar? Hart was the ink blot candidate onto whom people could project their own aspirations, and Obama would describe himself as a Rorschach test in which people could see what they wished. Hart was telegenic, and so was Obama, both slim and supple men who wore their clothes well. His high cheekbones and lean face are just right for the cameras, and his cool demeanor is just right for the medium, Drew said of Hart. Americans love something newan attractive and articulate something new. ... Americans are addicted to the idea that things can be better. ... By condemning the old ways ... he is suggesting that there is a ... reason things have not gone better, and that he can change that. Does this sound familiar? It does.

The Weekly Standard,C,The Transition Years  | The Weekly Standard,"
If any American was ever entitled to leave behind the burdens of public life, surely it was George Washington in 1783. Having created and led the Continental Army to victory over the mightiest military on earth, he had endured much personal hardship, including having to neglect his beloved Mount Vernon for over eight years. By the time he arrived home on Christmas Eve, he had no further aspiration (as he wrote to the Marquis de Lafayette) than to remain under the shadow of my own Vine and my own Fig tree. Only four years later, however, Washington would re-emerge as a political force, presiding over the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, and then being unanimously elected president.'General Washington Resigning His Commission by John Trumbull (1817)When historians examine episodes from Washingtons career to better understand him, they frequently choose his resignation from command of the Army, or his determination to decline a third term as president. Rarely considered is his decision to reenter public life after the revolution. It is this neglected phase of Washingtons life, between his departure from military service and his assumption of the presidency, that is the subject of this volume. 

These years are often referred to as the critical period in American history: A postwar economic downturn, coupled with a weak central government unable to pay its debts to veterans or foreign lenders, left many Americans in doubt regarding the viability of their new nation. Settlers west of the Appalachians were beginning to wonder if their future lay with a bordering power such as Spain or Great Britain rather than their eastern brethren, whose taxation seemed to fall disproportionately on westerners. While some may argue that these problems are overstated, the view of many of Americas leading citizens at the time was much different. Indeed, George Washington was among those who felt that things had quickly begun to go wrong after the wars end, and that the lack of unity among the states was imperiling the Glorious Cause for which so many had given so much.
Edward Larson notes that few books about Washington cover these years in depth, and that the numerous biographies generally focus on Washingtons agricultural innovations and active family life during this period. The result can sometimes be a portrait of a Washington who emerges from Mount Vernon only with the greatest reluctance to play out a script written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and others. Figuring actively in neither the Constitutional Conventions commencement, nor the Constitutions ratification, this Washington served mostly as a figurehead, lending little more to the proceedings than his hard-won prestige.
Larson sets out to correct what he views as misperceptions on these scores. He provides an overview of the critical period, the Constitutional Convention, and the post-convention events leading to Washingtons inauguration, each from Washingtons vantage point. Details about his farming and family life are played down here: We are left with a much more active and politically engaged Washington, who did as much as anyone during these years to bring the new republic into being.
One problem, of course, is that Washingtons influence cannot always be seen directly, but Larson teases it out through careful study of his (deceptively) mundane actions. Although almost completely silent throughout the convention as its presiding officer, Washington chose to dine simply with the other delegates at a tavern rather than at the mansion where he lived. When the debate turned to whether the presidency could be entrusted to one man, Larson speculates that this demonstration of common familiarity helped reassure the delegates, who presumed that Washington would be their first president. He also shows us how Washingtons political savvy helped ensure that the Constitution would gain acceptance. The result was a product that closely resembled what, for years, Washington had been advocating in private.

The Weekly Standard,C,The Bitter End | The Weekly Standard,"
Atchafalaya Basin, La.Louisianas Mary Landrieu is flailing in the political current. The three-term Democratic senator is a Hubert Humphrey liberal masked as a John Breaux left-centrist, submerged in a national party thats now left of George McGovern, in a state where political winds are blowing starboard.Mary Landrieu speaks to workers in Houma, Louisiana, November 25.NEWSCOMAnd shes anchored by weight of her own choosing. Landrieu didnt have to ignore opinion polls and vote for Obamacare, but she did. She didnt have to vote for radical Obama nominees like Debo Adegbile, pro bono legal advocate for cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, but she did. It was her own choice to vote against repealing the medical device tax and to vote increasingly pro-abortion in a pro-life state. She started her Senate career somewhat left of her Louisiana mentors Breaux and Bennett Johnston, and moved even further left. Breauxs lifetime American Conservative Union rating was 45, Johnstons 41; Landrieus is 20.
Its no wonder Landrieu is all but written off for reelection. No candidate won a majority in Louisianas nonpartisan primary held Election Day, so the two top candidates face a runoff December 6. Polls show Republican Bill Cassidy, a doctor and three-term congressman, with a double-digit lead.

But Landrieu still fightshard. Even on Election Day, addressing a media scrum after casting her own vote, she ripped into Cassidy: for his votes on disaster relief, for refusing to debate enough, for opposing equal pay. Despite a relentlessly negative campaignwhich has drawn copious criticism from local and national pressthe Landrieu effort maintains an energy that, in the Louisiana political tradition, has an appealingly entertaining vibe. That energy emanates from Landrieu herself, who for 35 years of public life has tried to outwork everybody around her. Now, stitching together a biracial conglomeration of mini-coalitions in every working-class small town, her campaign might be the nations last of its kind: old-style Southern populism, with a dusting of Cajun spice.
Two weeks before the runoff, Marys brother Mitch, mayor of New Orleans, traveled three hours west, across the Atchafalaya Basins miles of marshland, to the town of New Iberia. The mayor is his sisters best advocate, casually engaging and remarkably persuasive.
My sister is the oldest of 11 children, he says, all born within 11 years. Thats why shes so bossy. (The audience, 50 luncheon guests of the local Democratic party, laughs appreciatively.) But shes always shown a serious streak of independence. It allows her to serve with great distinction. He continues with a tally. Our coast is disappearing at 100 yards every 45 minutes, and Mary took up the fight. She made sure Louisiana got its fair share from offshore oil and gas, he says. Mary is 100 percent for Louisiana, all the time. ... She got money for Barksdale Air Force Base. She got money for Fort Polk. She got money for Interstate 49. She went to battle for us again and again.
He builds a compelling case for his sister with an infectiously upbeat demeanor. His defense of Obamacare is deeply personal but not maudlin: Nineteen years ago, doctors found a malignant, three-pound tumor in the stomach of the mayors daughter Emily, then 6. All the usual, horrendous treatments followed; Emily survived and is now a successful executive of some sort. Without Obamacare forcing coverage of preexisting conditions, her father says, she would probably be ineligible today for health insurance.
Cassidy provides the flip side to that argument the next day, back across the marsh and the Mississippi, in the town of Gonzales, a half-hour south of Baton Rouge and best known for its Jambalaya Festival. Cassidy is focused, disciplined, clinicalabout as far from Louisianas populist tradition as can be imagined. Asked before the rally for some favorite anecdotes from the campaign trail, he comes up with nothing folksy. Instead, he says, Ive been struck that Obamacare has been the principal issue. In Jefferson Parish, a 54-year-old woman who had had a hysterectomy, had no children, is being forced to pay $1,500 per month for a plan covering things she doesnt want. She asks me why she would ever need obstetric care or pediatric dentistry. Then there was a guy in Hammond, mid-50s, boys 18 or 19 years old. Two years ago his family paid $12,000 a year for insurance; last year it rose to $21,000, and this year theyre told it will be another  20 percent increase. He concludes: If people are not getting a subsidy, they are getting pounded.

Back before incoming senators Tom Cotton and Cory Gardner and Joni Ernst and Dan Sullivan were born, before new House members Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin and Mia Love were a gleam in their parents eyes, the Beach Boys said it best: Catch a wave and youre sitting on top of the world.Surfin' USAThomas FluhartyAnd so the Republican party sitsif not quite on top of the world, at least on top of the political scene. The headlines of the same New York papers that told us it wasnt going to be a wave election blared the wavy news on Wednesday. Riding Wave of Discontent, GOP Takes Senate, announced the New York Times. Republicans ride wave of anger against Democrats to recapture Senate, confirmed the Daily News.
Needless to say, when Democrats rode to power nearly a decade ago, at a time when voters were even more discontented with the state of the country and the winning party even angrier at the sitting president, it wasnt described by the media as a wave of discontent and anger. It was a wave of hope and change. If liberal anger was acknowledged, it was righteous anger; if progressive discontent was noted, it was healthy discontent.
Of course, theres no reason for Republicans to accept the media characterization of their victory. Indeed, theres every reason to mock it. As one Republican tweeted Wednesday, Who knew riding a wave of anger could be so much fun? And the crowds at GOP candidates headquarters on election night didnt look discontented or angry. Their mien was cheerful, their mood buoyant, their expressions hopeful.
Republicans are now the party of hope and change. Two weeks ago, we asked in this space, Supposing Republicans win a big victory on November 4. What then? Our answer: Celebration. Because the resultassuming its as strong as it looks 12 days outwill be worth celebrating.

So we write this in an upbeat mood, enjoying the thrill of victory. And part of that enjoyment for those of us in the curmudgeonly caucus admittedly involves relishing the despair of Democrats, mocking the plight of progressives, and delighting in the shock of the media. Schadenfreude is some of the best freude. But always we hear, in the back of our mind, the cautionary voice of the slave who rode next to the emperor in his triumphal procession, reminding him that this, too, shall pass.
And so, as we also wrote in that editorial two weeks ago, the celebratory mood, though heartfelt, will be brief. We know that this sixth-year election, like its predecessors, was mostly a negative and backward-looking referendum on the incumbent, and that its results are probably of limited utility in indicating what will happen next in the drama of American politics.
What will happen next? Thats not easy to predict, or easy to control. The new congressional majorities, we presume, will try to mitigate the damage President Obama can do, amass some real accomplishments, and develop a conservative governing agenda. Then comes 2016.
History suggests there are reasons for optimism. Parties rarely hold the White House for a third term. There is almost always a considerable dropoff from a presidents reelection vote to the vote for the nominee of his party four years laterenough of a dropoff to send President Obamas Democratic successor to defeat. The Republicans have the attractive younger candidates; the Democrats look as if theyll be nominating yesterdays person, someone who tried and failed before, the next in line.
On the other hand, recent polls have Hillary Clinton running ahead of various Republicans. The exit polls Tuesday night had 43 percent of voters saying Clinton would make a good president, but only 29 percent for Jeb Bush, with Rand Paul, Chris Christie, and Rick Perry trailing a bit behind.
Yet when Hillary Clinton was matched up with an unnamed Republican, she trailed 39 to 34, with 24 percent saying it depended on who the Republican was. Even if one adjusts for the likely 2016 electorate, the base Republican vote is as great as the base Hillary vote. The right Republican can win in 2016.
Is that right Republican one of the names tested in the exit polls? Perhaps not. Perhaps a Paul Ryan-Marco Rubio ticketthe ticket we suggested in January 2011 for 2012would fit the bill this time? Perhaps a ticket of governorsScott Walker and Susana Martinez?is the way to go. Or senatorsTed Cruz and Kelly Ayotte? Or maybe its time to go bold, go young, and go Army, with a Class of 2014 pairing of Tom Cotton and Joni Ernst? Who knows? We dont.

Are we the corporatist conservatives who fret that high marginal tax rates are stifling the risk-taking of wealthy investors, that business taxes are too high, that the entitlement state is unsustainable? Or are we the populist conservatives who worry about bank bailouts, dislike bonuses set by buddy-buddy boards, and believe with Adam Smith that workers are entitled to a decent wage and that free trade is fine so long as its beneficiaries, the winners, concede some of their gains to the losers?

Prospect of Real Immigration Solution Dimmed By ...A Very Merry Shopping Season IndeedChina's Shrewd Maneuvers If Obama Were as Tough on China as Republicans ...Voters Consider Mixed Economic Signals 
 


We could start by concentrating on what Republicans can do in the here and now for great masses of votersconsistent with good, conservative principles. The first would be a tax cutand not in the marginal rate for upper-income families or for corporations, the historic targets of tax-cutting Republicans. The theory of reducing marginal tax rates is that such cuts encourage job creation and risk-taking. Perhaps, but it is difficult to argue that current returns to businesses provide insufficient cash to fund new projectsjust look at the idle cash piled up in corporate coffersor that the wealthy are being overtaxed (cast an eye over data relating to the recent rise in incomes of the better off). Instead, cut the payroll tax paid by all workers earning less than some agreed level. After all, a stimulus to private consumption by people whose real incomes have been stuck on hold for years just might help conservatives get what they have been asking formore rapid economic growth.
This reduction in the middle-class tax burden can be financed in part, at least, by ending capital gains treatment of so-called carried interest, compensation received by hedge fund and private equity fund managers that almost no expert is prepared to defend as other than ordinary income. If such a move needs defense on other than fairness grounds, consider this: What John Maynard Keynes called the propensity to consume is surely higher for the recipients of the tax cuts than for the financial-types who would experience a tiny drop in their total incomes, meaning that total consumer spending might rise, not a bad thing in a growth-hungry economy. Only might, but weve tried just about everything else to break out of the slow-growth mode, with some but not a great deal of effect.
The danger is that the hedge fund losers will find other ways to take advantage of the convoluted tax code. After all, as Victor Fleischer of the University of San Diego points out, the top 25 hedge fund managers have five times the income of all the federal, state and local tax examiners, collectors and revenue agents in the United States, combined. They can deploy those funds to find ways of protecting their after-tax incomes, and for good measure deduct that spending from their taxable income. So if the take from the hedge fund managers proves insufficient to finance a middle-class tax cut, why not borrow the odd billion? Interest rates are low, and far better to borrow to fund a tax cut than to finance a government-led infrastructure program.
That may begin to boost the incomes of the middle class. Then for the next act, do its members a really big favor: Make their television viewing way, way cheaper. No, not by making Internet providers public utilities like electric and gas companiesanyone remember the last major innovation by his local utility? Instead, require cable companies to offer  la carte service, allowing you to pay only for those channels you want to watch, rather than be forced to buy a bundle of stuff, most of which many viewers dont want. This might cost some sports fans more for their favorite channels, but they would save on those they will never watch. Conservatives generally want consumers to have access to products without having them bundled by quasi-monopoly suppliers with things they dont want. Microsoft was not allowed to bundle its browser with its operating system, a longstanding antitrust policy. Surely sauce for the Microsoft goose is sauce for the cable-company gander.

This, the concise edition of Liberty and Union, is an abridgment of a larger, two-volume work. It contains a glossary of legal terms (writ, for example, is a court order), tables of cases, a list of the 118 (so far) justices of the Supreme Court, and the texts of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, and Constitution. And in a bow to the way we live today, which is to say digitally, the concise edition offers readers access to an interactive website that has links to primary and secondary sources, including cases, constitutional and historical documents, and scholarly articles. Liberty and Union is thus a newfangled thing, a living book.And it has a clear purpose. The coauthorsEdgar J. McManus, professor emeritus of history at Queens College, and Tara Helfman, a professor at Syracuse Law Schooltake care to explain that Liberty and Union is not a history of the Constitution, but a constitutional history of the United States. Thus, it pays attention not just to the making of the Constitution but also to the century and a half of constitutional development [that] preceded the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention. Further, while the book treats what the Supreme Court has said in numerous constitutional cases, it also recognizes that constitutional history is found not only in judicial (also known as constitutional) review, but in actions taken by the elective branches and the states. 

So this constitutional history of the United States may also be described as a history of American constitutionalismconstitutionalism being, the authors observe, the most powerful and durable ideology this country has produced. Their purpose, they write, is to provide a readable account of how constitutionalism has functioned over the years. And in that they have succeeded. The focus on constitutionalism is present in the title, which is taken from Daniel Websters famous reply to Robert Hayne in their 1830 Senate debate over the nature of our national government. Webster ended his remarks this way: Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable! Those two great ideas were then, and remain now, great pillars of American constitutionalism.
In a book of more than 640 pages, excluding appendices and index, McManus and Helfman tell the story of our constitutionalism in 33 chapters, the first one being English and Colonial Origins and the last The Roberts Court. Each of the chapters contains short entries (averaging a page or two each) on key episodes. Thus, English and Colonial Origins treats, among its 20 entries, Magna Carta and the divine right monarchy, while The Roberts Court discusses, among its 11 entries, the Affordable Care Act and marriage equality and the Court.
There is no shorting of the older history and its significance. For example, while the Declaration of Independence was, at the time of its writing, only a political document framed to rally support for independence, it is perhaps the most important document of American constitutionalism, setting forth with stirring clarity not only the reasons for the break with Britain but the principles to which Americans committed themselves as a free and independent nation.
Regarding the government established under the Articles of Confederation, the authors relate the familiar reasons for its failure but also observe its notable successes. The Confederation government succeeded in prosecuting the war against Britain, bringing it to an end by way of the Treaty of Paris, merely the single most important treaty in American history. Then, too, it passed the Land Ordinance for the distribution and settlement of the Western lands, which wound up defining basic land policy in the United States until the Civil War. It also enacted the Northwest Ordinance, which arranged for the government of the territories north and west of the Ohio River. The importance of the Northwest Ordinance cannot be exaggerated, write McManus and Helfman, as it established territorial principles that were followed by the United States for more than a century, giving a gloss of legitimacy to future westward expansion.

The American Spectator,C,A Solution for Cities on the Brink of Bankruptcy | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Detroit's decaying Michigan Central Station (Geoff Llerena, Flickr Creative Commons)Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Unfunded government pensions are driving municipalities across the country into bankruptcy  from Detroit, Michigan (the largest municipal bankruptcy ever) to Vallejo, California.
Despite the need for states and municipalities to have contributed large annual payments to their pension funds over many years, as a group they failed to do so. When coupled with overly optimistic return assumptions (also designed to reduce annual contribution requirements), it is no surprise that most pension plans are not actuarially solvent.
With the can now kicked, municipalities face unaffordable annual retirement contributions, taking away funds for current services and forcing municipalities like Detroit into bankruptcy. Taxpayers are trapped and public employees are cheated as an ever greater portion of taxes must be funneled into pension programs, or wages and benefits are frozen or cut, and even then, the chances of ever re-stabilizing are slim. Reforms are necessary.
For proof of this, look no further than Detroit, where current workers and retirees, facing massive cuts to promised benefits, had no alternative other than approving a freeze to its current pension plan and replacing it with a hybrid plan where workers bear more of the investment risks.
While Detroits hybrid approach recognizes the problem, it still ties government workers to a government run pension system that binds taxpayers to cover any investment shortfalls. And, it is not clear that Detroits proposed pension reforms are sufficient to sustainably address the citys structural pension problems. Consequently, we believe Detroits municipal employees (and all municipal employees) deserve a choice.



Under choice 1, workers and current retirees would continue risking their future pension on the wisdom of municipal leaders and hoping that the public pension systems will somehow return to solvency. Under Choice 2, workers and current retirees could cash out.
Under the cash out option, workers and retirees would receive their share of the currently funded portion of their pension obligation in a personal 401k-type account. The payout would eliminate all future obligations of the pension fund.
To enable Choice 2, each worker would be empowered to enter his/her own data into a simple calculator and receive a cash-out figure based upon their specific length of service, employee class, and salary history. Facing this option, some workers would choose to opt out, others would choose to stay.
For every employee or retiree who opted out of the governments pension system, the unfunded liability and therefore the cities annual retirement contribution obligation would be proportionally reduced. The worker could place these funds into low cost Exchange Traded Funds based upon broad market indices, and rules could be established to restrict early withdrawal or investment in high risk assets. Current employees who opted out would be concurrently enrolled in an ongoing defined contribution plan with costs to the worker and city known and comparable to non-public sector employees.
While not a scientific poll, the San Diego County Taxpayers Association has made anecdotal inquiries to a number of public employees. A surprising number expressed a preference for the relative security of funds in their name vs. the uncertainty of the bankruptcy court. In fact, private conversations with some union leaders suggest that such an option may be palatable because of the long term return to stability and predictability for municipal finances and therefore future public employee union member new- hires it would enable.
The San Diego County Taxpayers Association also convinced the authors of San Diegos Comprehensive Pension Reform initiative (passed by the citizens of the city in June 2012) to include language specifically authorizing such a conversion.
Unfortunately, the freedom to choose conversion  and the opportunity to reduce the need for municipalities across the country to declare bankruptcy is now held hostage by the IRS. The IRS refuses to declare this type of retirement plan conversion to be a tax-free event. Due to this uncertainty, no municipality we are aware of is moving forward with a conversion plan.
With Detroits options quite limited, it is time for the IRS to get off their dime and explicitly rule that a conversion from one retirement program to another should not be considered a gain.
Lets move past rhetoric and talk real numbers and real solutions. Lets put the power of choice into the hands of public employees and at the same time create a viable solution for municipalities that avoids the costly and uncertain route of bankruptcy.

Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Christians are being killed in tens of thousands in the Islamic World and Africa. A Christian woman in Pakistan is sentenced to be hanged for drinking from a Muslim cup. An official who tries to save her is murdered by his own bodyguard, who becomes a popular hero, and Jewish babies are murdered by more Islamic heroes in Jerusalem.The Church of England, meanwhile, devotes its energies to attacking the British Education Secretary for plans to teach British values in schools, calling them potentially dangerous, divisive and undemocratic.The London Telegraph reported that the church, which is responsible for educating about a million children in England, voiced fears that a narrowly focused definition of British values would be used to test whether people were loyal and safe.The government guidelines were drawn up after it was found schools had been infiltrated by Muslim extremists. The church said it had major concerns about the use of inspectors to police instances of promoting the values that diverged from the politically correct ideas of equality and diversity.It accused the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, of assuming very wide powers and closing down public debate.In October a small Christian school in Berkshire was failed by inspectors for lacking sufficient political correctness, and failing to prepare pupils for life in modern Britain. This looked like a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing, or more accurately, yet another case of a Tory Government not knowing what its own officials were doing: while the Government talked of promoting British values the school was punished by officialdom for being too British.The headmistress was questioned by government officials as to why she had not brought in a Muslim Imam to lead assemblies and as to whether children were being taught about sexuality under the Equality Act.The idea of bringing in an Imam to teach the presumably Christian-reared children about sexuality opens up all sorts of intriguing possibilities.


There was, of course, no suggestion of reciprocity  that Christian chaplains lead assemblies in Muslim schools (whether in Britain or Saudi Arabia) - to prepare their pupils for life in modern Britain by teaching tolerance, diversity, and respect for other religions, for instance.It is not hard to imagine how such a proposal would be received, though the recent revelations of the sexual abuse of 1,400 British children in the small city of Rotherham alone by Asian grooming gangs suggests there may be a need for wider education in such values. Surveys show that a large part of Britains younger Muslim population subscribes to extremist propositions, and has provided a large number of recruits for ISIS.One wonders what would be the response if the Imam advocated death for female adultery, child marriage, and judicial amputation for theft, female genital mutilation, stoning to death for homosexuals and the annihilation of Israel?Must the pupils at this Christian school be taught at morning assembly that Christ was not the Messiah but only a prophet, and Mohammed was the last and greatest prophet of Allah?Further, if Imams must leads assemblies, why should cults like the orange people or transcendental meditationists not get a look in, to say nothing of the rather larger religions Buddhism or Hinduism? Furthermore, the whole complex paradox of extending tolerance and pluralism to an absolutely intolerant and uncompromising creed is simply denied or ignored.Another high-achieving primary school, this time in Lincolnshire, has been attacked and denied its outstanding rating by government quango Ofsted because the pupils are too English and too white. How can it be expected to have non-white pupils if none live in the area?Orthodox Jewish schools have also complained about government inspectors asking girl students intrusive questions about sexuality, contrary to their culture of modesty.The churchs criticism came from its chief education officer, Nigel Genders, who warned against allowing a government definition of Britishness. The Church also published a submission to the government warning against such an allegedly negative and divisive approach.A government spokesman defending what should not have needed defense, said: The fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual respect and tolerance were set out by the Government four years ago and have been commonly used since.He continued, wetly, We believe that all young people should develop an appreciation of these values as this will help them to contribute to and succeed in modern Britain.Meanwhile, a senior Anglican Bishop, Lord Harries of Penmgarth, a former Bishop of Oxford, said Prince Charless future coronation service should be opened with a reading from the Koran.The gesture would, he claimed, be a creative act of accommodation to make Muslims feel embraced by the nation. I am not sure that even one of the clerical satire-figures of the late Peter Simples immortal column could quite capture that note of patronizing arrogance combined with cultural shame and masochism.He told peers that the Church of England should take the lead in exercising its historic position in a hospitable way.He claimed further that at a civic service in Bristol Cathedral last year authorities had agreed to a reading of the opening passage of the Koran before the beginning of the Christian ritual. This, he said, was a brilliant creative act of accommodation that made the Muslim high sheriff feel, as she said, warmly embraced but did not alienate the core congregation. That principle of hospitality can and should be reflected in many public ceremonies, including the next coronation service.Perhaps, to make the embracing even more complete and ultimate, the two Muslims who showed their appreciation of the principle of British hospitality by beheading one of Prince Charless soldiers, Lee Rigby, in a London street, could place the crown on the new King Charless head. Or should ISISs chief headsman be flown in to do the job?What of Omar Bakri Muhammad, the extremist preacher who is said to have played role in radicalizing the murderers of Lee Rigby and who has attempted to justify the killing of those fighting against ISIS jihadis, using Facebook to say that it is sometimes necessary to kill women and children sheltering in schools and hospitals? What could be more inclusive and multicultural than place for him at the Coronation with the ISIS executioners? Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,Dad & Dylan | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter When Bob Dylan was bestowed with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2012 (while wearing shades), I recalled seeing him in concert in my hometown of Thunder Bay, Ontario in August 1992 and concluded myreminiscing in this manner:So perhaps the time has come to see Dylan again  or perhaps not. Like a Presidential Medal of Freedom (or a Rolling Stone), some once in a lifetime experiences are best experienced once.Well, sometimes once in a lifetime just isnt enough. Last week, I received the following voice mail from my Dad, Bob Dylan is playing at the Beacon Theatre. Im going to the box office to get tickets for the both of us. Usually when I want to go to a concert, Im the one who has to persuade him to come along. Not this time.We had been to the Beacon Theater to see Dionat the Seventh Annual Ultimate Doo-Wop Showon Fathers Day Weekend. It nearly turned out to be the last time I would ever go to a concert with him. Seven weeks ago, Dad underwent emergency triple bypass surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital. Three of his arteries werecompletely blocked and his fourth was barely functioning. He had not been feeling well for weeks with a persistent pain in his back. Dad thought it might be a gall bladder problem and went to see his gastroenterologist. However, the gastroenterologist didnt any problemswith the gall bladder and thought the trouble might be with his heart and referred him to a cardiologist for a stress test. When the cardiologist saw the results of the stress test, he was so alarmed that he instructed my Mom and my sister to take Dad to Mount Sinai and that there would be people waiting for him. Twenty-four hours later, the surgery took place and Dad is here to tell the story. BTW, he still has the pain in his back. Well, better to feel something than to have no feeling at all. Better also to have a second chance than no chance at all.Needless to say, Dad wants to make the most of that second chance. A few days ago, Dad and a couple of his former colleagues at Lakehead University were discussing the wonders of smart phones. It would be my duty mock this, but I dont have a smart phone myself. (Yes, Ill get around to it eventually.) But they wereplaying around with it and Dad said, Bob Dylan in concert. The smart phone returned an upcoming concert date in New Jersey. Dads colleague asked, Are you going to go? If it was at the Beacon Theatre, Id go. Well, sure enough, the following day Dad is walking up to Broadway & 74th and sees under the marquee, Bob Dylan & His Band. Now he had to go.


As with me, this is also Dads second time seeing Dylan perform. He saw him play an outdoor concert in Dylansbirthplace of Duluth, Minnesota with Paul Simon on Fourth of July Weekend in 1999. Dad recalled Dylan talking about having a girlfriend named Mimi. Could that be Mimi Farina? I asked. MimiBaez was the younger sister of Joan Baez and Dylan was sweet on herbefore becoming romantically involved with herelder sister. Mimi Baez would become Mimi Farina upon marrying Richard Farina and they would make some pretty good musicof their ownbefore he was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1966 at the age of 29. But could there have been a Mimi in Minnesota? With Dylan anything is possible.Dylan actually reminds me of my Dad especially when I look at the Blood on the Tracks album cover. Dad had long curly dark hair and when he wore sunglasses I would be instantly tangled up in blue. Dylan would include two tracks from Blood on the Tracks  the aforementioned Tangled Up in Blue and A Simple of Twist of Fate. They are alsoboth 73 with my Dad a little over a month older than Dylan. Although Dad is well on the road to recovery, the road isnt always smooth. One good day is often followed by a day where he is completely exhausted. On the day of the concert Dad was experiencing stomach cramps. A combination of rest and chamomile tea gave him just the boost he needed to go to the concert. For me it was a nice warm bowl of Manhattan clam chowder from Utopia on Amsterdam between 72nd and 73rd.In the latest leg of the popularly dubbed Never Ending Tour, Dylan is focusing on the present rather than the past. Two-thirds of the songs he performed were released after theMillennium. Half of these songs were from his 2012 album Tempest. Aside from the two songs from Blood on the Tracks, the only other material he performed from his early days was She Belongs to Me from Bringin It All Back Home and, in the encore, Blowin In The Wind.Although Dylan came out decked in a beige hat and long coat, it took a while for him to get into his rhythm. After his first set, Dad described Dylan as inarticulate. Its not the first time hes been described in this manner and it wont be the last. Following the intermission, there were noticeably fewer people in our section of the audience. It could be that they found better seats. Or maybe they decided to move on to something else.There were some annoying things about the concert that had nothing to do with Dylan, but rather with the facility and the crowd itself. It was a late-arriving crowd. People were constantly being seated through a good chunk of Dylans first set. With people constantly standing up it was hard to see the show. Dad pointed out that when you go to Lincoln Center if you dont arrive by the opening curtain you dont get in until after intermission. Hefurther observed that it was like being at a ballgame. There were a lot of people getting up and going to the concessions to get food and drink. Its one of the reasons he prefers to watch ballgames on TV.Fortunately, Dylans second set was stronger and did much to offset these annoyances (as demonstrated by my Dad yelling Zimmy after each song, in reference to his birth name, Robert Zimmerman). Although Dylan no longer plays guitar, he does play piano and his harmonica playing now has a Toots Thielemann quality to it. The highlight of the show was Forgetful Heart from his 2009 album Together Through Life. His vocals were a lot clearer and they were augmented by Tony Garnier on upright bass.Dylans band is a solid unit led by Charlie Sexton on lead guitar. I remember when Sexton was a teen guitar sensation with a Top 10 hit in 1986 called Beats So Lonely. Although he did not attain superstardom, he has become a highly respected session player and concert performer, his reputation cemented by his long association with Dylan. Iparticularly enjoyed Donnie Herrons work on violin during Blowin in the Wind and on pedal steel guitar during Dylans homage to Frank Sinatra.Yes, you heard right. Dylan went from singing Tangled Up in Blue to singing Blue Eyes. The final song of the evening was both a blast to the past and a new way forward for Dylan. He sang a cover of a Frank Sinatra song Stay With Me, which he introduced into his set list in late October. Dylan is due to release his new album Shadows in the Night sometime in 2015. Although it isnt official, it appears this album will be full of Sinatra covers. Earlier in 2014, Dylan put another Sinatra cover Full Moon & Empty Arms out on his website. Well, if Dylan can sing Santa, then why not Sinatra?It wasnt the best concert Ive ever seen, but it was far from the worst. That distinction belongs to David Cassidy, but thats a story for another time. The more important thing is that we were there to experience it together for better or for worse. When I told a friend I was going to see Dylan, she asked me why Dylan doesnt just retire. He most certainly could, but as he sings in Tangled Up in Blue hes still on the road headed for another joint. What else does he know? The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keepin on like a bird that flew. The same could be said for my Dad. Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,The Shock of Christmas | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Creative Commons (Kishorekumar 62)Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Alas it is over. I am speaking of the Thanksgiving Day celebrationone of my favorite holidays. It is a serious celebration as we give thanks for our many blessings. Yet it is also a jolly day, full of good food, drink, and sport, perhaps touch football, more likely a televised game. The whole family comes together and, often in the company of friends, has a festive time. Moreover, there is a venerable sense of tradition to the feast that renders the whole holiday somehow reassuring.However, now comes a time troubled by a deep sense of apprehension, especially for people of faith. I am speaking of the Christmas season. The apprehension begins with how we greet people? Last week it was customary to say Have a Happy Thanksgiving or just Happy Thanksgiving. I must have intoned that line a hundred times, never with a premonition of giving offense or of introducing an evangelizing spirit into a brief social encounter. Happy Thanksgiving might be prefatory to devastating a plump bird, but only the very morbid are offended and they can always munch on a nutrition bar.Now, after Thanksgiving Day, thoughtful people are given to pause. Does one greet another with Merry Christmas? In some parts of the country it is deemed rude, even belligerent. Play it safe and try Happy Holidays or, maybe, Happy Winter. That last absurdity has been trotted out, admittedly at the fussy suggestion of educators in the Stalinist northeast. Some of the comrades have even created an entire pageant around an imagined Winter Holiday as opposed to the traditional holiday of Christmas.


Thanksgiving causes no such unpleasantness, though I do not know why this should be so. Most of us sitting down to our traditional turkey are offering thanks to God. That has been true ever since President Abraham Lincoln made the last Thursday in November a federal holiday as he put it of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. Who do the cavilers think we are offering thanks to, the giant corporations? Wall Street? Big Bird? Well, if we were, that should disturb them as much as a hearty Merry Christmas. You can be sure that the kind of person who objects to Merry Christmas also usually suffers similar psychological tics about the giant corporations or Wall Street bankers. The same cavilers who have created such a stir over Christmas are usually full of animus about capitalism and other organizing principles of American society.When one considers the enormous lengths to which some people have gone to make Christmas a controversial occasion one has to pause and wonder what the controversy is all about. There are certainly non-believers who take the holiday in stride: Jews, Muslims, atheists, even the who-cares members of American society. Some of the aforementioned probably even take in elements of Christmastime, for instance, gift-giving, mistletoe, and eggnog.I think we get a sense of what the Christmas controversy is about when we look at the reductio ad absurdum of the controversy. That is when we see the cavilers trying to ban the Christmas tree, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and perhaps Frosty. What is so religious about a Christmas tree? The tree may not be religious but it is traditional in America at this time of year, and now we are getting a glimpse of the true animating spirit of Christmass opponents. They do not much like traditional America. They want to reform it. They want to take down the manifestations of a revered and ancient holiday and replace them withwell with nothing. What would they put up in the place of the infant in swaddling clothes, choral music, and that infernal tree?American leaders and the American people have reason to celebrate Christmas at the end of every year for various reasons, some solemn some trivial. As for the solemn reasons, remember the prayer offered up by the President of the United States as America embarked on the last year of World War II. Though Franklin Roosevelt was not a Republican, I think many Republicans today can share his sentiments when he said on Christmas Eve, 1944:It is not easy to say Merry Christmas tonight to our armed forces at their battle stations all over the worldor to our allies who fight by their side. [Yet] the Christmas spirit lives tonight in the bitter cold of the front lines in Europe and in the heat of the jungles and the swamps of Burma and the Pacific Islands. Our soldiers know the determination of all right-thinking people and Nations, that Christmases such as those that we have known in these years of world tragedy shall not come again to beset the souls of the children of God. We pray that  will protect our gallant men and women in the uniforms of the United Nationsthat He will receive into His infinite grace those who make their supreme sacrifice in the cause of righteousness, in the cause of love of Him and His teachings.So Merry Christmas my Democratic friends, and Independents, and, certainly, Republicans.

Oliver Willis (Flickr Creative Commons)Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter For the past twelve years Ive volunteered at a crisis pregnancy center serving mainly low-income women in the District of Columbia, and Ive noticed something about how our clients talk: Nobody ever says prison. Boyfriends, husbands, fathers, sons were never locked up, in jail, or serving time; they were always incarcerated.There is an unexpected poignancy to the bureaucratic terma lacy Latinate word suffused with so much pain, as if standardization and abstraction could dissolve shame. Hesitation first, and then that careful, strictly-speaking incarcerated, like the set phrases we use in the confessional.Nothing could be further from these womens delicacy than the National Museum of Crime and Punishment, a giant KFC bucket of suffering. I spent about four hours in this glitzy memorial-without-memory, accompanied by at least two school field trips. Admission is $23.21 and, you know, your self-respect.The Museum of Crime and Punishment is one big ad for a lot of things: law-enforcement jobs, Americas Most Wanted, the myth of progress. In the dark entrance stairwell, clusters of televisions show disjointed, contextless crime footage. A mans voiceover gives the museums mission statement:In a free society like ours, some think nobody has the right to tell us what to do. But the law is on your side. Its there to balance the scales and restore the victims rights. Remember, you wake up each morning with a choice: Play it straight, or press your luck. So is what you plan to do in your life worth a month, a year, or the rest of your life behind bars? Its not. Not for you, not for the victims, or for your family.Eventually everyone faces judgment. Some pay the ultimate penalty. Others are sentenced to what many consider a fate worse than death.I doubt many visitors hear this entire spiel. It plays on a loop, meant to set a certain atmosphere. I like the queasy theology of ita promise of judgment without the hope of mercyand the chop-licking reference to prison as a fate worse than death, and I like how it answers its rhetorical questions just in case. I like how it addresses us as potentialcriminals who roll out of bed each morning feeling like Raskolnikov. I like, too, how the news headlines projected onto the walls of the stairwell contradict the voiceovers message: OJ SIMPSON FOUND NOT GUILTY. CONVICTED KILLER FOUND INNOCENT AFTER DNA TEST.The museums exhibits are arranged in rough chronological order, starting with what the museum calls Medieval Times (or The Dark Ages) but which actually seems to cover a period from about the fourteenth to the eighteenth century. These exhibits are history horror shows of gibbets, leg irons, scolds bridles, a shame flute supposedly affixed to the faces of bad musicians, whips, chains, and baroque torturous bric-a-brac, accompanied by wall texts which gawp at the brutality of the dead. Theres a soundtrack of clanking chains. It is considered an age before enlightenment... etc. The middle-schoolers ahead of me are vocally horrified by a Water Torture Funnel which has an effect similar to waterboarding Neither the wall captions nor the kids make this connection, since it doesnt fit the narrative of enlightenment. Ive read Jack Chick tracts with more nuanced approaches to history.Let me pause and say that I genuinely appreciated the museums focus on the use of shame and public humiliation as punishment. Its all framed as, Look at these horrible medievals! But recognizing humiliation as a form of dehumanizationand maybe the central organizing principle of torture, since you have to dehumanize the subject before you can torture himis somewhat countercultural these days. We hide prisoners away so we dont have to take responsibility for what happens to them (and then make jokes about not dropping the soap). But tacit complicity is a little better than active participation. And maybe some kid will see the line, In all cases the punishment was intensified by the fact that the victim was exposed to public insult, and wonder why the Museum of Crime and Punishment has a gallery of celebrities mug shots. Would you trade a day in the stocks for a chance to get rid of the worst parts of your online, searchable, inescapable public persona? Or to ban the showing of your episode of COPS?The wall texts here decry Double Standards for men and women, rich and poor, consistently emphasizing our distance from the past. (As Court Fees Rise, The Poor Are Paying the Price, National Public Radio, May 19, 2014.) The Puritans criminalized crazy stuff like dice cogging! (Bill Winters...will spend the rest of his life in prison for a string of petty crimes, the pettiest his final booking in 2009 over a box of candy swiped in a burglary. Lafayette Independent, August 2, 2013. Why Should Thousands of Prisoners Die Behind Bars for Nonviolent Crimes? Liliana Segura, the Nation, November 13, 2013.)Clumsy or ungrammatical phrasing and spellcheck errors plague the museum. We get Jessie James, twice, but my favorite was the description of Bugsy Siegels Flamingo being built in the dessert town of Las Vegas. One exhibit titled Medieval Executions features a guillotine and a quote from Georges Danton, as if the French Revolution were medieval rather than the opposite of medieval. At least they spelled Georges right. In the Old West section theres a quotation from one of the William Pitts. (Not sure which one.)


It would be a mistake to attribute any philosophy or even a consistent mood to this desultory, sentimental museum. But to the extent that there is any continuity between exhibits, this continuity lies in the museums besotted swoon in the presence of power. Lawmen, bank robbers, even Pancho Villa (ATENCIN GRINGOS! his recruiting poster reads, FOR GOLD AND GLORY)if youve got a gun and you look cool, without that creepy serial-killer dead stare, you will be glamorized here. Theres a section on pirates and although the wall text says that pirates were poor, and modern piracy is bad, kids, dont be a Somalian pirate when you grow up, the images all show super-cool, well-tanned pirates shootin guns and havin funs. But then, Hanging Judge Isaac Parker is glorified too.The museum is very meta: It spotlights, and claims to critique, the glamorization of violence in which it participates. Some researcher truffled up a terrific Ford Motors advertising card from the Dillinger years, which reads, When will they catch Dillinger? on the front. On the back: Not Until They Get Him Out of a Ford V-8! The museum highlights the way the James Gang, and Bonnie and Clyde, sought to create their own legendsand mostly succeeded. A wall text reads, In many cases, the public actually rooted for the bad guy, before reassuring that ultimately, the bad guys got what was coming to them....The museums attitude toward power is exemplified in the opening to the section on American punishment. You go through a doorway and on the wall there are brief tributes to prison wardens who were considered more humane than the norm: James Johnston, nicknamed The Golden Rule Warden, or Thomas Murton, who reformed Arkansas prisons after major abuse scandals. But as youre trying to read these wall texts, a video plays on a loop in which a fake warden snarls like something out of a nightmareor at least Cool Hand Luke:Within these walls, we are the law, and your freedom is just a memory. In your cell the sink and the toilet are exposed, and you will be too....Remember, no one put you here but yourself. You are now in my custody, and the life you had no longer exists.Benevolent use of power is kinda sexy, in a dad-like way. We can all get behind those nice wardens. But abuse of power is really sexy.A big wheel on the wall says, Hero or Villain? Turn the wheel to see if these legends were good guys or bad guys. The wheel is broken.There are things to notice in this museum, quiet hints of something. Theres a lot of glossed-over sadness in the description of the fatherless Barker Gang: From the age of 10, [Alvin] Karpis ran with an ugly crowd of gamblers, bootleggers and pimps in his hometown of Topeka, Kansas. He spent time in reformatories, but his crimes only escalated. It was while doing time at the Kansas State Penitentiary that he met Fred Barker. A lot of these criminals met their partners and learned the tricks of their illicit tradesin the prison system, but Im sure thats just a coincidence.In other areas, hard truths are simply ignored. Theres a big serial killer sectionwhere nobody seemed to lingerand the description of Jeffrey Dahmer talks about his victim who escaped and finally drew police attention to Dahmers murders. It doesnt mention the earlier escapee who got to the cops but was returned to Dahmer, because cops sometimes look at drugged, nonwhite youths who say theyre fleeing a killer and shrug their shoulders. Domestic dispute. But the law is on your side, the stairwell voiceover reminds us.The exhibit on police gear works hard to convince us that we are no longer living in Medieval Times. Cops use safe compliance weapons like tasers, pepper spray, and flashbangs. (Cops Beat, Taser Man to Death: They Just Werent Done Until He Was Dead, Daily Caller, May 15, 2014. New Mexico Woman Sues Over Pepper-Sprayed Vagina, Toronto Sun, November 28, 2013. Georgia toddler critically injured by polices flash grenade, Washington Post, May 30, 2014.)The museums good-citizen instincts are at war with its show-business urges. Sober text is often contradicted by flashy, misleading interactives. Theres a surprisingly solid display about the unreliability of eyewitness evidence, including discussion of the Innocence Project, which works to use DNA evidence to free wrongly-convicted prisoners. But this is followed by a crime-solving game where you witness a man running from an apartment, and the text is all about how memory is tricky and eyewitness evidence is shakyand then the man in your video stops, the camera zooms in, and he stands there so you can get a good long look at him. Later, when youre asked to give details about his appearance, the video replays first to help you out! I have a mind like a steel sieve, my memory is mostly made of wishful thinking, and I got every question right.(The only question I can remember was something along the lines of, Did the man have long or short hair?)Similarly, the descriptions of actual famous prisons like Leavenworth and Attica, and some of the texts on prison history, include novelistic details and empathetic descriptions of prisoners suffering. There are glancing references to the horror of solitary confinement (today between 20,000 and 80,000 prisoners are in solitary, which the museum doesnt mentionas always, cruelty is confined safely to the past) and the overall tone is one of pity for prisoners who were isolated, forbidden from speaking, or beaten by racist guards. The Leavenworth exhibit notes that inmates raised and collected money for the 9/11 Relief Fund after the attacks. The Attica display explains the 1971 riot by listing some of the abuses to which inmates were subjected, including assaults by guards, and vivid details like, Inmates were only allowed one bucket of water per week as a shower. They were issued one roll of toilet paper per month.But all of these text-heavy displays are hard to read, because the museum has seen fit to display them behind fake prison bars. In order to make the displays more visually appealing or more branded, the curators (if thats the word I want) made it much less likely that anyone would actually read them, instead of skipping to the colorful display of prison tattoos. The prison history section, where I spent a lot of time, was almost empty.Maybe the most interesting thing in the museum is its treatment of prisoners artwork. The text strains to ensure that we dont identify with prisoners. Theyve been caught, so theyre helpless, rather than powerful like the pirates and gunmen were encouraged to admire. But this is our only sustained glimpse of prisoners as people who do things other than crime. There are intriguing bits about how you make art supplies in prison and a note that artists can earn as much respect as tough guys. Some of the art is crude, colorful, and moving: One prisoners pano or handkerchief art shows a sunlit woman holding a flower, the brightest painting you ever saw. Some of it is normal in the worst way: Theres two eagles crying over 9/11, and a kitsch painting of a soldier hugging his daughter as she clutches an American flag.The museum is exhausting. You can learn to crack a safe, do a police training simulation, shoot carnival-style guns at an Old West-themed range, learn about the suit used in the Robocop movies, and on and on. I havent mentioned the autopsy table with the fake body, or the small quiet tribute to law-enforcement officers who died in the line of duty, or the bizarre text about Prohibition in Washington that doubles as an ad for local cocktail bars. I havent mentioned the various entertainingcriminalknickknacks and attractions: Al Capones rosary, Bonnie and Clydes bullet-riddled death car (and Bonnies terrible, terrible poetry), quotations from Edmund Campion and Edmund Burke.I gave up somewhere in the basement level, in the sprawling CSI section. I skipped the Americas Most Wanted wing.And yet in this warren of sunny-side-up misery, so many things arent mentioned. There is one mention of making amends, in the description of a computer genius who, perhaps unwittingly, unleashed the first computer worm. Now he works on making Internet commerce secure. Theres nothing on restorative justice or on returning ex-offenders to their communities, no display on the enormous number of collateral consequences that can follow someone who has served his time, nothing on moms in lockup (about one in twenty-eight American children have a parent in prison; some of them have been on field trips to this place), nothing that even attempts to answer the question of whether incarceration reduces crime. No interactive exhibit asking which things you believe should be crimeswith the huge, unexplored exception of Prohibition, crime is treated as an Aristotelian natural kind rather than a category defined by the powerful. While theres a graphic comparing recent incarceration rates in different states, theres no graphic comparing the United States with other countries, even though we are the worlds leading jailers.And for all its self-righteousness toward the guilty, the museum has virtually nothing about their victims, or about the experience of being a victim of crime. Theres nothing about trauma, recovery, the cycle of abuse (unless that sad depiction of the Barker Gang counts), forgiveness and reconciliation with the person who hurt you, or the debate over victims rights movements. Victims are not powerful.In the gift shop you can buy JonBent Ramseys fathers book, and Aileen Wuornoss. Theres a onesie that says, I JUST SPENT NINE MONTHS IN SOLITARY, and a gun to shoot ketchup onto your hot dog. You can buy an official Museum of Crime and Punishment lanyard with your name, or with the message, GOD IS LOVE. Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,Political Patsies: Is That the Best the Stupid Party Can Be? | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Lets say there are two political parties in a country. The Evil Party and the Stupid Party. When the Evil Partys candidate is elected president, he abuses his power and rules by diktat, like an all-powerful king. Thats why hes evil. Not everyone likes this, however. Some dont like his diktats, and some dont like kings. The latter complain that this is contrary to the countrys constitution, but in fact no one is going to stop the Evil president from abusing his power while hes in office.One of the Evil presidents chief goals is to ensure that the Stupid Party never wins a presidential election. But now lets suppose (hey, its just a hypothetical) that the Stupid Party wins a presidential election one year. At this point the Party has a choice. The Stupid president can either assume the broad king-like powers of an Evil president, or he can rule more modestly in what he thinks is the countrys constitutional tradition.If he rules as a monarch, the Stupid president can reverse all the diktats of the Evil president, and that has to be very tempting. If, on the other hand, the Stupid president rules more modestly in what he thinks is a constitutional manner, the Evil diktats stay in place. That would make the Stupid president look like a patsy, and turn the countrys rule-by-presidential-decree into a one-way ratchet. Evil presidents proclaim bad laws, and they never get reversed.Amongst the countrys pundits, some harken for a return to an older constitutional tradition, and urge the Stupid Party to adopt the patsy strategy. If we play nice, they say, surely the Evil Party will learn to follow our benign example. That way well return to our good old constitution.


Once in power, well approach the Evil Party and say, Look, were not going to abuse the power of the presidency. All we ask you to do is promise that you wont go back to your evil old ways when you win next time. And, having said that, the Evil Party will promise to be good. Laughing up its sleeve.Theres only one problem with this. The other guys are called the Evil Party for a reason.After all, whats to prevent them from welshing on their promise? Political parties exist in what Thomas Hobbes called the state of nature, where no superior court can ensure that promises are enforced. In that case, said Hobbes, he that performeth first has no assurance the other will perform after, because the bonds of words are too weak to bridle mens ambition, avarice, anger, and other passions, without the fear of some coercive power and therefore he which performeth first does but betray himself to his enemy.We never lack for trusting patsies, however. Thirty years ago they told us that if we unilaterally disarmed, we could trust the Soviet Union to reciprocate. Today they tell us to trust the Iranians when they tell us they wont build a nuclear bomb. Or to govern constitutionally against the Evil Partys promise to do likewise in the future.It doesnt work like that, however. The grim logic of the game demands that one partys defection from the constitution be answered by a like defection by the other party, tit-for-tat. When one partys president rules as a king, so too must the other partys president.Is that how the game ends, in a monarchy? Just possibly, like the competing rulers during Thomas Hobbes seventeenth century Britain. But possibly not. Its at least more likely that well return to a more modest constitutional regime when both parties abuse the power of the presidency than when the Stupid Party plays the patsy strategy. Let the Evil Party think twice before its president issues his diktats. When it brings a gun to a fight, let the Stupid Party bring a gun as well. Not a banana. Its only the threat of payback that can bring us back to a republican form of government where presidential power is limited.

The American Spectator,C,"FDA: More Nutrition Information Will Make Americans Healthier  Oh, Really? | The American Spectator","Print Article      
        
FDA.govSend to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter The Food and Drug Administrations broad new menu-labeling rules will force restaurants, movie theaters, and grocery stores to add calorie information to the food they sell. The FDAs action is based on a provision of the Affordable Care Act mandating more nutritional labeling, which is part of a federal plan to control the obesity epidemic in this country.This new information, which few consumers will pay any attention to, will cost the affected industries $1.9 billion. Of course, the extra cost for all this new information, which few except Washington bureaucrats are really interested in, will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.FDA officials opine that the new requirements will help consumers make informed choices for themselves and their families, and thus will lead to healthier nutrition. Thats a laudable plan, but I just dont think its worth much.When Charlie orders that jumbo pizza with the works for the Monday Night Football broadcast, I doubt hes going to send it back when the pizza box tells him it weighs in at a whopping 4500 calories. Nor do I think the calorie count on that twelve pack of beer will deter him in the slightest from his evening party plans.


Similarly, I suspect that Sally and Tom wont forgo the large box of buttered popcorn on their date night out at the movies away from the kids simply because the calorie sign blares out the dire news of 1200 calories per box.[1] They will want to savor that rare evening out with all the trimmings, just as they do their Thanksgiving feast at home without regard to that federally mandated calorie count provided by the Nanny State.And I dont think the new rules will have a negative impact on sales at bars, taverns, and ballparks. When Dominick meets his pals at Big Als Tavern after work for their attitude adjustment hour, I dont think they will forgo their super-caloric boilermaker routine because of the conspicuously posted nutrition listing. In fact, when that new alert is first posted, I would imagine he and his fellow drinkers will have a few choice words about Uncle Sams intrusion into happy hour at his local watering hole.To be sure, extra nutrition transparency will benefit careful consumers by providing extra information on which to make their dietary choices. Vegans, vegetarians, and gluten-free folks are sure to welcome all this additional nutrition information. But, its unlikely to stop or even slow down the obesity epidemic that plagues our society. Its a huge leap of logic to think that simply providing useful information will immediately change dietary habits that are hard-wired into the publics DNA.A recent scientific study released about the same time as the FDAs new rules concluded that even recommending a calorie-counting app to overweight people and giving them access to it on their cell phones does not lead to weight loss. The studys lead author, Dr. B. Yoshi Laing, said that recommending the use of the popular app MyFitnessPal to a broad group of people interested in dieting did not lead to weight loss, compared to people who didnt get the recommendations to use that diet tool.So, providing more nutrition information to the public is unlikely to move the needle much on our national obesity crisis. Nutrition information alone wont make you slim. Your waistline isnt going to be reduced because you know the calorie count of that pizza slice.Nonetheless, the FDA persists in its belief that more calorie information will be the silver bullet to reduce the expanding girth of Americans. For example, consider this bureaucratic mumbo jumbo the agency used to announce the new standards: Consumers can systematically make suboptimal dietary choices because they discount future health consequences relative to immediate benefits more than they would if they chose according to their underlying or true preferences, leading them to regret their choices at a later date. Huh??!! Couldnt they just as easily have said, I cant believe I ate the whole thing. Ill be so sorry in the morning.And the FDA insists it must act to force these calorie disclosures in the interest of national health, even though most Americans wont pay any attention to the mandatory postings at restaurants, pizza parlors, vending machines, and taverns: Changes in labeling may increase internalization of future costs into current decision-making by making the long-term health consequences of consumer food choices more salient and by providing contextual cues of food consumption. Say what? I guess they could have simply said, Well, these new nutrition postings should scare the hell out of everyone and make them more careful about their dietary choices. But, for federal bureaucrats, flowery is better, inscrutable is best.The simplest way to put it would be people often eat and drink things they find appealing and only later wish they hadnt  which doesnt mean they wouldnt do exactly the same thing if they had to do it over again. But one hardly needs the intervention of Big Brother to know that. Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,Net Neutrality Compromises the Internets Future  | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Joseph Gruber (Flickr Creative Commons)Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Perhaps President Obama envisions that the Internet is operated by Ernestine, the condescending telephone operator played by Lily Tomlin on Laugh-In. Otherwise, it is difficult to justify why he would want to hobble the 21st century broadband industry with regulations designed in the early 20th century.
Even FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler earlier this year wrote, the FCC is not going to take over the Internet, or dictate the architecture of the Internet. And yet, the FCC is now under pressure to follow President Obamas statement on November 10 to regulate the Internet under obsolete 1930s laws.
These 20thcentury telephone regulations were intended to regulate traditional telephone services, not todays advanced Internet services. And, they did a poor job of that.
Until the 1980s, telecommunication regulations codified inefficiencies, such as granting each Baby-Bell a regional monopoly. These regional monopolists stifled competition and thwarted innovation. Regulatory reform during the 1980s eliminated the regional monopolies, incented economic efficiency, and enabled the telecommunications revolution that spurred the tremendous advances that still drive our economy today.
This revolution completely changed the dynamics of the Internet. Thanks to the easing of these early 20th century regulations, commercial Internet services started to emerge beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Twenty-five years later, todays Internet market and service offerings scarcely resemble the Internet of the early 1990s. Back then, communication service companies served distinct markets  cable companies provided consumers with television content and telephone companies provided consumers with landline based phone services. And, mobile technology was unheard of for anyone but the wealthiest few.
Since 1996, private sector firms have invested $1.3 trillion into the U.S. wired and wireless Internet infrastructure $75 billion in 2013 alone.The high-speed Internet industry contributes $146.2 billion to our nations economy.Perhaps even more importantly, Internet access has increased economic productivity.



Yet Internet regulation has lagged, leading some  like President Obama  to argue for inappropriate regulatory changes. The most drastic proposal: regulate Internet providers like the Ma Bells of the 1930s by subjecting them to Title II of the Communications Act.
Those calling for such a shift should be careful for what they wish.
Reclassification of the Internet under Title II is not effective regulatory reform. This reclassification is supposed to address customer access problems, and ensure that everyone is treated fairly. But, there is simply no evidence that Internet providers are arbitrarily restricting customers access to the Internet in order to increase their revenues.
In fact, Americans have been getting faster and more dependable Internet services at competitive prices increasingly every year. Akamai found that Internet speeds have increased by 39 percent in between the second quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014while the OECD found that the U.S. ranks first out of all OECD countries in Internet affordability.
Instead of effectively empowering consumers and fostering an environment of innovation, subjecting the Internet to Title II regulations would severely restrict how providers can deliver high speed Internet services to their customers.
Title II is simply the wrong foundation from which to regulate the innovative Internet industry.
Beneficial reforms must instead recognize the dynamic nature of the Internet.
The types of services that the Internet is able to offer are continually growing. Additionally, the types of companies that are able to offer different services continually changes: former telephone companies now directly compete with former cable companies, while a search engine behemoth can offer fiber services in certain markets.
In recognition of these realties, the silo basis of the current regulatory structure within the Communications Act is simply inappropriate for the dynamic 21st century Internet as we know it today. The Internet requires a regulatory system that does not discriminate by type of company and recognizes that services over the next decade may no longer resemble the services offered today.
Regulatory reform during the 1980s eliminated the regional monopolies, incentivized economic efficiency, and enabled the information revolution that spurred the tremendous advances of the past quarter century.
Effective regulatory reform for the Internet can replicate these gains. But, only if the principles of sound regulation are not compromised.

The American Spectator,C,Do What the Cops Tell You: It Isn't Rocket Science | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Wikimedia CommonsSend to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter It was shortly before Christmas in Washington, D.C., a Saturday night In the early 2000s.I had been invited to a neighborhood Christmas party on my Capitol Hill street. As it happened, afterward I was scheduled to go out to dinner with a neighbor and her two house guests, a couple visiting from Chicago, at a downtown restaurant. Shortly before the party was to begin I received a phone call from the clearly anxious party hostess. She had ordered liquor from a store on the other side of the Hill and the store had just called to say their delivery man was ill and she would have to pick it up herself. Alas, the hostess did not have a car. So she asked if I would go pick up the liquor, already paid for.No problem, said I. At this point my neighbor with the house guests suggested that the husband of the visiting couple  Jim was his name  go with me and that we take her car. No problem again. So very shortly the two of us  Jim from Chicago and myself  were in my neighbors car headed across Capitol Hill for the liquor store, Jim doing the driving and me doing the directing. It was already dark and a light rain was falling. We arrived at the liquor store and picked up the delivery, a box filled with hard liquor and wine. It was placed on the back seat and we were quickly on our way back to the neighborhood. Somewhere along Pennsylvania Avenue, Jim noticed that we were being trailed by a D.C. police car. We reached the bottom of my short one-way residential street and just as we were about to make the turn the lights on the police car started flashing. Jim pulled the car over immediately, effectively blocking the entrance to my street.What was this? Jim had not been speeding, neither he nor I had been drinking. What was the problem?Two police officers approached the car on each side. The one on Jims side asked to see his license and asked for the registration. Having no idea where it was I started to look in the glove compartment. The cop noticed that Jims license was an Illinois drivers license. Is this your car? came the question. No came the answer. The officer on my side asked me to roll down my window. I did so. Finding the registration and handing it over I began to explain. This was my neighbors car, she lived  I pointed  at the top of this street on the left side. She was there right now with Jims wife, waiting for us. All that had to be done was talk to her if there was a problem. The command came from the cop on my side to be quiet. He wasnt kidding either. The tone was sharp. Now I was exasperated. What was this all about? This car was stolen, Jim and I were told. No, said I, it was not stolen. I began to explain again and this time the cop had had it. Please step out of the car. It was raining. I was dressed casually but for a party and a night out. Officer, said I, exasperation in my voice, all you have to do is go to that house right up there and The command again to be quiet and Step out of the car. At this point Jim had reached his own stage of exasperation  with me. Shut up Jeff! I opened the door and got out, as did Jim. We were ushered to the back of the car. Another police car arrived, and another, the latter barreling down my one-way street with lights flashing.Jim and I were now spread-eagled against the trunk, arms and legs wide, hands on the trunk. There was radio chatter. We were getting wet. This went on  and on  for five or ten minutes. Suddenly the attitude changed. In a blink we were given an apology and told we could go. It seems that the VIN  Vehicle Identification Number  did not match the one on the stolen vehicle. The suggestion was made to tell the car owner to get a new car  or this could happen again. Incredulous and wet, Jim and I got back in and drove the few hundred feet to my neighbors house. The liquor was delivered, I dried off and the evening proceeded with holiday cheer.Why tell this story?As the Obama White House holds meetings with civil rights leaders to discuss the break down between police and residents in communities like Ferguson, my story is a story of two white guys being stopped for supposedly stealing a car  by two white cops. White cops in a city with a black majority and in a well-to-do neighborhood that was racially mixed.What if I had, as the evidence from the Ferguson Grand Jury clearly shows, struck the white police officer as Michael Brown is known to have struck Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson? What if I had suddenly lunged for that white police officers gun? If I had been that utterly stupid, at a minimum I would have been arrested for assault, at a maximum I would have been shot dead on the spot.


This isnt rocket science. As was clear from the response by the cop when I tried to tell him to check with cars owner just a few doors away  one does not argue with a cop. Period. My race  and the race of the cops  was irrelevant. They stopped Jim and myself because they thought we were a couple of car thieves.Could I have raised holy hell afterwards? Sure. In fact, my neighbor the car owner did call the police chiefs office the next day  and was told again: get a new car or this could happen again. She was (justifiably) incensed  and kept her car. But thats it. No one led outraged rallies against the city's power structure.My story came to mind watching National Reviews Rich Lowry on Meet the Press the other day. Rich made the obvious point, which horrified Andrea Mitchell of NBC and Eugene Robinson, the liberal columnist for the Washington Post:Here's the transcript:CHUCK TODD: Rich, whats interesting when you look at whites, whites that live in urban communities believe that we still have a race problem in this country. Whites that live in more rural, basically whiter communities, they dont see the race issue. Do you think thats part of our divide? That maybe rural whites dont see this issue the way folks that live in urban America?RICH LOWRY: Perhaps, but you look at Ferguson specifically, this is an area where the governmental structures havent caught up to the demographic change over the last two decades or so. And thats something you take care of simply by organizing and voting. But what I really object to is you can discuss all these problems but lets not pretend this particular incident was something it wasnt. If you look at the most credible evidence, the lessons are really basic. Dont rob a convenience store. Dont fight a policeman when he stops you and try to take his gun. And when he yells at you to stop with his gun drawn, just stop.ANDREA MITCHELL (interrupting): Whoa!The look on Mitchells face  and her body language  is almost classic. Robinson, in turn, simply tries to ignore the physical evidence that tells the true tale of a big, aggressive, and arrogant bully foolishly taking on a cop. The fact such basic common sense as Lowry suggests is seen as somehow outrageous tells you all you need to know about the bizarre world in which liberals live. I was stopped by a cop. The cop was white. I am white. The cop told me to stop talking and get my butt out of the car, hands on the car, legs spread wide. After three attempts at an explanation, I did exactly what I was told to do. There was nothing in the least racist about what happened.Over at Politico, Lowry made the point last week in a piecetitled The Ferguson Fraud:The bitter irony of the Michael Brown case is that if he had actually put his hands up and said dont shoot, he would almost certainly be alive today.His family would have been spared an unspeakable loss, and Ferguson, Missouri wouldnt have experienced multiple bouts of rioting, including the torching of at least a dozen businesses the night it was announced that Officer Darren Wilson wouldnt be charged with a crime.This is a terrible tragedy. It isnt a metaphor for police brutality or race repression or anything else, and never was. Aided and abetted by a compliant national media, the Ferguson protesters spun a dishonest or misinformed version of what happened  Michael Brown murdered in cold blood while trying to give upinto a chant (hands up, dont shoot) and then a mini-movement.When the facts didnt back their narrative, they dismissed the facts and retreated into paranoid suspicion of the legal system.Exactly. As my own experience that rainy night in the nations capital suggests, when the police tell you to do something  do it. If you dont  there is trouble. White, black, brown, red or yellow  there is trouble. Period.It isnt rocket science. Really. Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,David Brooks Insults Capitalism | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter I object to the term crony capitalism because it gives a misleading and negative perception of the most beneficial  and moral  economic system ever experienced by man.I object to New York Times columnist David Brooks for the same reason.Few things are more harmful to a rational debate over national economic policy than an electorate that is not just uninformed, but misinformed. And when it comes to economics, misinformation almost always has the effect  no doubt intentional  of encouraging voters to mistrust liberty, especially economic liberty, while looking to a feckless, impersonal, self-serving government for care and comfort.Assailing capitalism is necessary for the election of Democrats. But, outside of liberal enclaves and universities, spreading misinformation and distrust of free enterprise is not a particularly easy task since its benefits are obvious to most Americans: capitalist countries have higher standards of living than non-capitalist countries; capitalism has lifted a billion human beings out of poverty in less than a generation; Americans are congenitally allergic to government meddling in our businesses (though too many are willing to tolerate meddling in other peoples businesses); and our nation was conceived to enable your pursuit of happiness  a pursuit that you instinctively know is most compatible with economic freedom.Therefore, an effective (even if dishonest) critique of capitalism requires attacking its edges rather than its strong heart by focusing on barely relevant tertiary effects (real or, as with Brooks claims, fictitious) and demonizing the rich as greedy, heartless, and parasitic. Youve heard these myths repeated ad nauseam, particularly leftist frothing about income inequality, the rich buying elections, the one percent, and so on.Each of these tropes is easily  and often  debunked. But they still have some effect on those whose basic understanding of economics and liberty causes them to forget that no other economic system has done as much good for as many people as capitalism and no other system is compatible with a free people.Of course, its all the better for the left if a conservative makes the arguments for them  which is where David Brooks usefully comes in.Brooks recent article, The Ambition Explosion, represents the pinnacle, or more accurately the nadir, of soft elitist antipathy toward capitalism. The basic point seems to be that capitalism arouses enormous ambition, but it doesnt help you define where you should focus it.Brooks article isnt reprehensible simply because it is so wrongheaded but also because it plays into the Upper West Side view of capitalism as spiritually and morally bankrupt, letting the supercilious cocktail party crowd say, while resting on Brooks declining credentials as a conservative, See, I told you so.


To wit: Within the online comments to Brooks confused article are such liberal gems as Finally you have written a column I can completely agree with. I love the good of capitalism and I hate the evil of it. We need balance. So, Christine, just what do you balance freedom with?And then there is Daniel who says that Capitalism promotes individualism. As such it is antithetical to tradition and morality. Is that because collectivism is so tradition-honoring and principled? Howd that work out in Cambodia, just to name one national victim of anti-individualism?David Brooks assumes that ones economic life is supposed to be the source, or at least a key underpinning, of ones spiritual life. He argues that capitalism nurtures the illusion that career and economic success can lead to fulfillment, which is the central illusion of our time.But does it really, and is it really? Did Hayek or Friedman or Smith suggest profit as a substitute for prayer or any other non-economic aspect of human endeavor? Is there anything inherent in free-market economics that implies it is supposed to create or replace fulfillment? No, Brooks target is the thinnest of straw men.David, what capitalism allows is for you to avoid the life described by Thomas Hobbes as the default situation for humankind: solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. Capitalism ensures that you dont have to spend every waking hour looking for food or worrying about illness, injury, or death; capitalism allows even the poor some time to pursue other things  things that can lead to fulfillment, a term with a meaning so broad as to be meaningless in a discussion of economics.And if capitalism actually does cause people to think that economic success can lead to fulfillment (not an entirely unreasonable proposition as far as it goes), is that not preferable to, say, communisms nurturing a realization that fulfillment is both impossible and a thought crime?Brooks expands on his bizarre idea to argue that Capitalism on its own breeds people who are vaguely aware that they are not living the spiritually richest life, who are ill-equipped to know how they might do so, who dont have the time to do so, and who, when they go off to find fulfillment, end up devoting themselves to scattershot causes and light religions.Condescend much, David?And  as economist Don Boudreaux taught me, the key question when considering an economic policy  compared to what? Compared to non-capitalist societies where religion is frowned upon, if not banned and persecuted? Compared to places and times where mere survival would take all your time? At least it saves the hungry and poor from a metaphysically devastating awareness of their lack of spiritual fulfillment. Oh, the humanity!Brooks mention of light religions and scattershot causes is particularly bizarre. After all, the United States remains, despite a persistent decline in our economic freedom, a highly capitalistic country. It is also consistently one of the most religious (and most generous) countries in the industrialized world. Furthermore, I would suggest that there is an inverse correlation in this country between the lightness of a religion and its members support for capitalism. For more information, see Unitarian and Reform Judaism.From Rotary Club to church groups to Boy Scouts to environmentalist organizations to a never-ending array of charities that millions on the left and the right hold deep commitments to, the idea that Americans engage in scattershot causes is laughable. Perhaps Mr. Brooks, wading through his own religion of light conservatism, is just projecting.The article spends most of its time oddly criticizing China as an extreme example of this phenomenon, claiming that (capitalist) fever, like communism before it, stripped away the deep rich spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Taoism. It says something about NY Times readers that they would take seriously anything Mr. Brooks says after a statement so comprehensively disconnected from reality.Early in his murderous tyranny, Chairman Mao Zedong spoke positively of religious freedom  while at the same time attacking Christians, especially westerners, and saying that missionary work was designed by imperialist powers to poison the minds of the Chinese people. But any ambiguity about Maos (unsurprising, given his Marxist roots) hatred of religion was long gone by the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in 1966: religion faced intense assault, with houses of worship destroyed, bibles, religious texts burned, monks and priests beaten and shamed.As UCSD Professor Richard Madsen  an author of a dozen books on Chinese culture and (unlike David Brooks) a true expert  put it, Until the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, the Peoples Republic of China suppressedand, during the Cultural Revolution, violently persecutedvirtually all forms of religion.But in recent years, as the still dictatorial Communist Party has moved the country steadily toward a capitalist economic system, the revival of religion (along with the decline in poverty) in the Middle Kingdom has been nothing short of astounding. Madsen continues: Most secular China scholars in the West assumed that Chinese religion was dead. Thus, one of the biggest surprises of Chinas reform era (beginning in 1979) has been the resurgence of religious belief and practice. All across the country, old forms are being revived and new forms invented. These unexpected developments call into question not only our ability to understand China, but also many of the assumptions that social scientists hold about the secularization of the modern world.Yet Brooks wants us to believe that increasing economic liberty (even without equal political liberty) has had the same impact on religion in China that the bloody wave of Maoism had? His claim shares more in common with Holocaust deniers than it does with reality.Brooks wrings his hands over the fact that Chinese capitalist reforms raised the ambition levels of an entire society. Im still struggling to understand how anyone could object to that, given the alternative of passively watching your squalid life ebb away under the boots of depraved commissars who would not allow you a moment of self-concern, much less ambition.Perhaps Mr. Brooks would like to ask a quarter-billion new Chinese urbanites who have fled the persistent grinding poverty of Chinese farm life whether they would like to exchange their current economic opportunities for their prior oh-so-pleasant lack of ambition (and the short life span that goes along with it).A Chinese peasant knows what Mr. Brooks doesnt: Free market capitalism, despite the screeching and condescension of the hard and soft left, is  borrowing Winston Churchills characterization of democracy  the worst economic system except for all the others.Brooks manages to contradict his own theory of the spiritual equivalence of communism and capitalism by noting that as China was moving from the former to the latter, many Chinese sensed that there was a spiritual void at the core of their society. They sought to fill it any way they could, with revived Confucianism, nationalism, lectures by the Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel and Christianity.As if the beginning of capitalist reform rather than decades of brutal repression caused that spiritual void. And as if those living in Maoist China would have even dared discuss a spiritual void much less have the ability to try to fill it. For their new opportunities, economic and spiritual alike, they have capitalism to thank. Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,The Sins of Elizabeth Lauten | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Martin Gysler (Flickr Creative Commons)Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for a GOP congressman, committed a cardinal sin in politics last weekend: posting on Facebook about a couple of aggravated teenagers forced to endure their dads turkey-pardoning ceremony, during a space of time where little to nothing of note was happening on the national scene. Thankfully, our esteemed fourth estate immediately seized on her transgression against the cult of personality inhabiting the White House, and badgered her and her under-the-radar Republican boss until she was forced to publicly apologize, resign, and pack up her things from her Hill apartment and return to that segment of flyover country from whence she came. The media may not know how to handle more pressing matters facing their industry, like whether they should report accurately on a Missouri grand jury investigation so as not to further inflame community tensions, but they sure know how to make a girl cry.Unfortunately, Ms. Lauten not only made the error of openly criticizing presidential progeny, something the media would surely never do, except when Republican presidents daughters flash their panties on the sidewalk after falling out of a bar they werent supposed to be in. As a seasoned purveyor of gossip on the Internet, particularly when it comes to the White House  my most notorious contribution may be revealing that Michelle Obama doesnt realize you can buy ill-fitting sundresses at Target I can tell you thatLautencommitted certain, other venial sins that made her an immediate target of ire. 1. She talked about the kids.Its not that the kids are off-limits. Its that the kids arent responsible for what happens day-to-day at the White House. If the daughters had managed to snag jobs as the official pardoned turkey representatives of the Obama administration, their presence would have been more official and their sheer exasperation at the utter inanity of the tried-and-true American tradition of pretending turkeys have a long-enough life span to make pardoning them significant, a cause for alarm. Instead, someone in the residence probably pulled the plug on their Xbox Kinect and confiscated their cell phones until they fulfilled their very important job of standing behind their father, reading a proclamation about a bird, and looking like they belonged there. Until one of them does something truly horrendous, like try to benefit America's foreign policy by dating Justin Bieber, this can probably be considered nothing more than a hilarious mishap. In fact, a more apt commentary on the entire scene might have been a meme of Sashas fierce sister side-eye.2. She said the words ""classy.""


There are few things in Washington that are truly classy. A couple of lower-key Christmas parties untainted by lobbyists, perhaps. Nancy Pelosi's tri-color string of saltwater pearls. One or more of Trey Gowdys panel-themed haircuts. And while the concept of class has not been in effect much in the Obama administration years (or for that matter, the Bush administrations two terms of wearing white tie with cowboy boots), there are few thingsless classy than an official engagement involving a turkey. Nothing about the event screamed sophistication, and quite rightly: nothing about the Thanksgiving holiday of stuffing your face with carbohydrates and watching giant men tackle each other on Astroturf screams sophistication. Thats because this is America, goddamit, and our forefathers gave their blood, sweat, and tears so that we could once a year celebrate our proud twin traditions of obesity and violence.3. She talked about their clothing in relation to a drinking establishment.There is no doubt that America in general, and, according to Ms. Lauten, the First Daughters specifically, is suffering from an epidemic of missing pants. These days, from the waist down, nearly anything goes, whether that anything effectively covers what its supposed to cover or not. People think leggings are pants. People think tights are leggings and therefore pants. People think underwear are tights and therefore leggings and therefore pants. But in all listed cases, none of our generic people are actually, in fact, wearing pants. Sasha and Malia arent actually guilty of any of these crimes against the nature of fashion, but their skirts might be a tad on the skimpy side, at least when paired with their chosen footwear. Neither of the First Daughters, though, is looking primed for a night of underaged drinking and Tinder. That said, they did not look safely outfitted for encountering sometimes-tricky native fowl. I probably would have recommended waders. Which are pants.4. She assumed they still listen to their parents.The looks on their faces should have told her everything she needed to know. Barack Obama may not be the best role model when it comes to things like managing the outbreak of a deadly virus or handing democracy safely to the Middle East, but theyre not looking to him for fashion advice. And they never were. The man wears Mom jeans and hiking sandals and seems to have trouble with any waistline that isnt elastic. They wrote him off on that account probably around the time they encountered their first chapter books.5. She's Republican.By far the most egregious thing Ms. Lauten could have done was check Republican on her first ballot all those years ago, and somehow agree to work in a job that most of the media considers distasteful, by which I mean any job within spitting distance of something that could be considered a conservative agenda. Even though shes one of over 30,000 staffers on the Hill, was well known mostly just to Republicans before Thursday, and merely updated her private Facebook page with her spur-of-the-moment commentary, by virtue of her chosen affilation she was immediately promoted to lead communications consultant within the tip of the spear of the GOPs vast manufactured melodrama machine, gaming the clearly right-leaning national media by leading a stealthy attack on the First Daughters so that more egregious commentary could follow, thus totally destroying the Obama familys credibility among the target demographic of absolutely no one. While some leftist sites spent valuable time digging up scooplets about Lautens adolescent midemeanors, others agonized over what was to come. Was Lautens merely the first in a barrage of attacks? Will she receive a heros homecoming and a ticker-tape parade at the next gathering of villainous GOP operatives in their mountaintop fortress? It is all so terrifyingly possible, that administration mouthpieces havent slept for days, even despite the tryptophan.Heres hoping that Ms. Lauten has learned from her foray into fashion commentary: dont pick on the kids, dont assume they have fun in their spare time, and most certainly, dont ever tell anyone you're a Republican.

The American Spectator,C,Flying Into Integration | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter So, a roundup of the week. On Monday, wifey and I flew to Atlanta. The people at LAX looked as usual  frantic, worried, frightened, angry. They took their seats and kept on looking tense. I fell asleep for most of the flight.Except  I awakened and looked at the fine Delta in Flight Entertainment choices. To my delight, there was a film called Nixon on Nixon. It was highly edited, wildly biased, not at all representatives of what Nixon supposedly thought and believed, based on the tapes.The excerpts themselves were a total scream. I liked especially the parts where the authors of the film tried to make Nixon look like an anti-Semite. Yes, indeed, they had a ton of Nixon quotes calling Jews familiar derogatory names.But they also completely forgot to mention that most of Nixons top policy choices were Jewish  including Arthur F. Burns at the Federal Reserve and Henry Kissinger as National Security Adviser. They also forgot my dear old Pop as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.And, of course, they completely forgot to mention that Richard Nixon was by far the most pro-Israel President there has ever been, that he personally saved Israel after Golda Meirs catastrophic mistakes in the Yom Kippur War. The portrayal of Nixon was so wildly, insanely out of touch with who Nixon really was it made me laugh at first and then get very sad.I was fascinated to see that one of the names behind the film was a Rockefeller. How the old Eastern money hated and envied Nixon, and it continues to this generation.Never mind, God loves those who guard Israel. The movie made me nostalgic for those days. What an honor: to toil for the man who ended the war in Vietnam, opened China, and saved Israel. Just in opening China, RN lifted more people out of oppression and misery than any other world leader ever has. What a place he has in history.When we got to Atlanta, it was as if we were on another planet. Even though it was Thanksgiving travel week, the airport was calm. The people in the concourses did not look worried. At the food court, I got fried chicken and ate next to a relaxed couple from Mississippi.Black people, white people, men, women, all were happy. Somehow, this immense southern hub just has happier people than we have at my home in L.A. Many beautiful women and square-jawed men, too. A whole different look. Why? I am not sure. I think its because the southerners have been in America longer and feel safer.We took a comfy small plane from ATL to Greenville. There, it was even more of a miracle. Men and women and children looked dramatically calmer, had more open faces, talked more cheerfully.Everyone wished everyone else Happy Thanksgiving and seemed to me to mean it.


We had gone from a place of frightened people to a safe garden.Our driver, Bob, took my wife and me to see our daughter-in-law and our granddaughter. Alas, the grandchild was asleep. Kitty was taking a test on line. So, wifey went to sleep.Then Bob and I went to the nearest Waffle House. It was empty except for two immensely large waitresses and a very old cook. One other customer, a fantastically drunk white man with a beard, was playing 50s R & B and literally hugging the jukebox as he danced slowly with it.At midnight, Bob shook my hand for my 70th birthday.Terrifying.On the way back to the Westin Poinsett, we passed a bar with lots of young people laughing outside. We went in. Three young women wanted their pictures taken kissing me on the cheek for my birthday. Not so bad.In my room, I watched the Ferguson rioters and looters and thugs and attempted murderers steal liquor and cell phones and try to kill a reporter from CNN, who took it well. Those people are dirt. Just scum. Violent criminals. Not political. Not moral. Just savage beasts.I wonder if any of those horrible people had jobs. Or went to school. Or ever went 24 hours without getting high. But the reporters on the liberal networks were saying the problem was with the Grand Jury. Why couldnt they send an innocent policeman to prison just to satisfy the mob? These lefties in the MSM are not keeping their eyes on the ball.Cui bono? To whom the benefit? No one benefits if there is violence after the black leaders have threatened violence  except the black leaders They become more important, get on TV more, get more speaking gigs. The young hoodlums get maybe a case of beer. They get the momentary thrill in their pitiful lives of seeming powerful. But it doesnt last. Theyll die in prison or of gang shootouts or of overdoses. The black leaders get limousines and private jets.Selling a lie as big as this: the black childs danger is from the police pays well. Everyone, every single person with any sense, knows thats a lie. But where is the profit in attacking the gang bangers? They might just shoot back. The police wont.By the way, dont think that its only some black people who are angry about Ferguson. Except for the days of the busing struggle in the mid 1970s  which ended in the destruction of urban and suburban school systems all over the land  I have never seen white people as angry as they are about Ferguson.People do not like to be pushed around. Not black people. Not white people. White people who see the police as their friends do not like seeing themselves called racists because they tell the truth about black crime. White people who pay taxes and obey the law dont like to see themselves branded as immoral by apologists for gangsters.Black people certainly have had terrible times in this country in the past. Terrible, terrible things were done to them. But at some point thats not an excuse to blame white people for the problems they have brought on themselves.The majority  decent people  the hard working family men and women, the churchgoers, the ones who care for their grandkids while the moms smoke rock  these are the victims of all of the lies about how racism caused all of their problems. They are the ones who live in fear, not of the cops, but of the bangers whom the Sharptons dont talk too much about. They are the ones who suffer if the police are not around.No race, no people, ever got to the Promised Land by blaming others for their problems. They get there by hard work and respect for Gods word. That wont make the news but its true. The churchgoers know it.Later that day, on the 25th, my birthday, Bob and I went to a Chick-fil-A. As I ate my fabulous sandwich, a black man walked by with a University of Alabama sweatshirt on.Roll, Tide, I said.Roll, Tide, he answered and then he introduced me to his daughter, who goes to Alabama. This is it, I thought to myself. This is truly it. Forty-five years ago or so, George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door to prevent the University of Alabama from integrating. Fifty-two years ago, three men died in riots aimed at keeping Ole Miss segregated. Now Bama has a number one or two rated football team that is largely black.This is the reality. America has become an integrated society, especially in the South, land of friendly faces. Al Sharptons living and Barack Obamas politics may require that we pretend that something else is happening, that this is still the America of the Klan. But that is a wicked lie, and though sin is bound to come, woe to him by whom it comes.That Roll Tide man at Chick-fil-A. His daughter. Ole Miss as a highly integrated school. This is the reality of America today and it is a triumph. Much more to be done if we can get the leaders to step aside. But we have had a triumph. The rest of the world looks on in envy and the mainstream media tries to deny it, but these are glory days.I will write more tomorrow.

Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter MondayThis will be short and sweet. We got back Saturday night to LAX. The passengers milling around the baggage carousels looked desperate, terrified, unhinged. Why? I can well recall when I flew to LAX in the 1970s. The terminals were open air. The passengers looked happy and relaxed. Now they look as if they are fleeing Islamic State.Maybe they are. Maybe thats why they look so scared. We have so many immigrants in LA now. Many from the Middle East, fleeing bad situations, fleeing for their lives. Some of them live near me in Beverly Hills. No matter how rich they are  and they are often rich  they look fearful.Their grandchildren may look happier. Maybe. Meanwhile, in my minds eye, I go back to Greenville, where the passengers and their families look happy. I miss Greenville. I miss Jean playing the piano at the Poinsett Club. I miss the waffles at the Waffle House.I want to look and feel relaxed. Hard to do if you are me and have so many people asking you for money.Anyway, today I went to my prayer meeting, where we talk about recovering from self-hurtful behavior. A woman sitting near me said that until she found God, she did things to herself that she wouldnt do to her worst enemy. I thought that was brilliant. How many times have I drastically harmed myself? And how many times has God helped me?


Meanwhile, Phil sent me an article about a famous scientist named Watson who helped discover DNA. Hes been shunned because he says the evidence is that people from Africa are not as intelligent as other people. This seems strange to me. Now, I can tell you that I work and have worked with some super intelligent black people. So, obviously, there is much to quarrel with in Dr. Watsons assertion. But if Dr. Watsons data is wrong, as I assume it is, then lets correct that data. That would be far more convincing than persecuting him. I wonder what the data is. It would be tricky to assemble it because the environmental factors for blacks and whites are often different. But the real point here is that maybe its better to argue and debate with people we disagree, and collect data on the subjects in dispute than to treat our opponents as lepers. Isnt that what science is all about? Racism was based on totally phony science under Hitler and maybe its time to have real science in every field, instead of persecution of the minorities who have minority points of view. In any event, all Americans have equal rights under law, and maybe thats the key point. There are all different kinds of Americans, but we all have the same rights under law. That's what makes us a great nation.On to another subject: Phil gave me a tablet device for me to use on trips. I was worried about it, but I took it to my local Beverly Hills Verizon store. It was supposedly a Verizon-oriented machine.Ooops. The young man there had no idea  and I mean NONE  of how to set up this device. Okay. I tried to buy a battery from him for my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Notes 2 phone. Ooops, again. Incredibly, Verizon stores do not sell Verizon phone batteries. Can that be true?Meanwhile, four other customers came into the store and the clerk could not help them with anything.There is a bit of a lesson here: we economists are worried about productivity that is rising much more slowly than it used to rise. No one seems to know why. But I have an idea. Because our workers are so poorly educated relative to the tasks they are called on to perform that they are a dead weight on the economy.Maybe the collapse of education is actually finally taking its toll. It was bound to and now it is.And meanwhile, as ISIS rolls heads and crucifies the innocent, we pass our days gossiping about movie stars and worrying whether a fifty-day session of a Grand Jury in Missouri was thorough enough  and we humiliate and torture a man held to be innocent of any crime and who was risking his life for us. The way we dump on the people guarding us, the police, the cops, who have ten times the guts any of us has, well, it is just sickening. The people who loot or steal are heroes and martyrs and the cops who protect us are criminals? We have a lot of learning to do.Tomorrow it is supposed to rain torrentially here. We need it in every way. Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,California Faces Death by Pension | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
AkosSzoboszlay/Wikimedia CommonsSend to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter When the November election was still a long way off, Sacramento-area streets were already plastered with campaign signs for a little-noticed political race: candidates are running to serve on the board of the California Public Employees Retirement System, better known as CalPERS. While not as high-profile as the statewide and congressional races, these seats are arguably of equal importance to Golden State taxpayers. CalPERS, the largest state pension fund in the country, not only manages more than $257 billion in assets, but also loves to use its political muscle to prod corporate America into socially responsible (read: leftist-friendly) investing.Sacramento, as the state capital, is Public Employee Central, so the race has become heated and costly. The campaign signs that caught my eye promised pension security and were paid for by the Service Employees International Union. This election is a touchstone for the entire pension issue in Californiaand, per usual, it doesnt look good for the taxpayer.In short, the people who benefit from CalPERS have complete control over it. Those who pay the tab have little if any say. Six of the board seats are set aside for various groups of CalPERS membersfor example, one for retirees who receive pensions, one for eligible current state employees, and so on. Then there are three members appointed by the governor and the legislature, both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Californias public-sector unions.And there are four ex officio members: state officials and employees that alsosurprise!have close ties to the union movement. That includes state Treasurer Bill Lockyer, who in a 2011 speech about CalPERS had this to say about the daunting unfunded liabilities that might force pension reform:If we need to do it, then we ought to do itbut onour terms. We must not allow the debate on retirement security to be framed by those who simply seek to eliminate altogether defined benefits, the social and economic power of public pension funds in the market, and the power of workers and their unions to be a balancing force to business and the unregulated marketplace in American life.The treasurers staff underlined those words in the official text of the speech. When Lockyer said reform should only be undertaken on our terms, he meant those of the public sector unions and the government workers. He clearly was not sympathizing with Californias hard-pressed taxpayers. The governor and most others in state government have the same attitude. They dont care about pension debts and the burden on taxpayers. They care about protecting the current system as it now exists.And what a system that is, if one happens to be a government employee. Californias entire public-sector compensation system is absurdly generous. For instance, the median pension for a recent state Highway Patrol retiree is $98,000 a yearavailable at age 50, and paid for the life of the retiree and that retirees spouse. The median pay and benefit package for a California firefighter is more than $175,000 a year.As the Orange County Register reported in 2011, the city of Newport Beach had fourteen full-time lifeguards, with thirteen of them earning more than $120,000 a year in total compensation. More than half the lifeguards collected more than $150,000 for 2010 with the two highest-paid collecting $211,451 and $203,481 in total compensation respectively, according to the report. These are not aberrations.California salary schedules are filled with city managers earning $300,000 or more a year and low-level administrative employees earning around $100,000 a year. This is true at the state-government level and even in the poorest cities. The San Joaquin Valley city of Stockton paid its workers at 125 percent of the California state averageand gave them a Lamborghini-style health-care plan that provided lifetime benefits after working for the city for as little as two months. Big surprise that Stockton now is in bankruptcy court.In the private sector, most workers receive 401k-style defined-contribution plan, in which final retirement income is based on the amount the worker puts in and the success of the stock market. Californias public workers, in contrast, receive what are called defined-benefit retirement plans, in which guaranteed payment amounts are based on a formula. Most so-called public-safety employeespolice, firefighters, prison guards, billboard inspectors, school security guards, cooks at prisons, etc.are eligible for the 3 percent at 50 plan. That means they receive 3 percent of their final pay times the number of years worked, and it is available to them at age 50. (Its usually calculated on base pay and not overtime, but overtime counts in some jurisdictions.) Thus, if a Newport Beach lifeguard earns $150,000 a year, after thirty years he receives 90 percent of that payor $135,000 a yearfor the rest of his life and his spouses life. The retirement ages are so low that in some cities taxpayers are paying for an entire second ghost workforce behind the one thats actually doing the job. (New York City already is past that tipping point, as taxpayers there pay more retired cops than active ones.)Pension funds such as CalPERS invest the retirement contributions paid by workers or their employers (in many agencies, workers dont contribute a cent to their own retirements) in stocks and bonds. They guess at how well those investments will do. The higher the forecast returns, the better funded the system; the lower the predicted returns, the bigger the unfunded liabilities. If things go well, the public employees split up the loot. If they dont go well, taxpayers must backfill the losses.Union activists insist the average California pension is in the low $30,000s, but that includes people who retired eons ago and ones who worked only a short time in the system. The formulas are the formulas, and they have increased dramatically since the late 1990s. Some workers have figured out pension-spiking gimmicks, as well, ways to work the rules to inflate their retirements even further.Its also important to note that pensions are guaranteed against any reductions once they have been granted. Pension payments are senior obligations of the state to its employees and accordingly have priority over every other expenditure except Proposition 98 [K-14 education] expenditures and arguably even before debt service, said David Crane, former Governor Arnold Schwarzeneggers chief pension adviser, in 2010 testimony before the state senate. Crane is a self-styled progressive Democrat, yet he is outraged at the way CalPERS has gamed the systemto the detriment of every public service. All of the consequences of rising pension costs fall on the budgets for programs such as higher education, health and human services, parks and recreation and environmental protection that are junior in priority and therefore have their funding reduced whenever more money is needed to pay for pension costs, he added.


This isnt just a dire projection. Cities across the state are facing massive infrastructure breakdowns and they lack the money to fix them. Consider this picture painted by the New York Times earlier this year: The scene was apocalyptic: a torrent of water from a ruptured pipe valve bursting through Sunset Boulevard, hurling chunks of asphalt 40 feet into the air as it closed down the celebrated thoroughfare and inundated the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. The key point was buried deeply in the news story: And here, as in other cities, the demand for public works comes as the costs of municipal pension plans are shooting upa confluence that has alarmed business leaders.Even when cities go belly up, they cant dislodge the main expense that is pushing them over the brink, thanks to the power of CalPERS and to the elected officials who owe their seats to the states muscular public-employee unions. Three recently bankrupt citiesStockton, Vallejo, and San Bernardinocity officials came up with recovery plans that did not touch public-employee pensions. City officials preferred instead to stiff bond-holders, raise taxes on residents, and slash city services. I know Stockton welland that beautiful old Gold-Rush city on the edge of the California Delta is falling apart because of a lack of public services. Vallejo officials publicly stated that they were unwilling to challenge CalPERS, which holds that all pension promises must be paid in full come hell or municipal bankruptcy. San Bernardino halted its payments to CalPERS, but eventually buckled under to that agencys threats. When exorbitant pensions for an elite class of government workers are protected at all costs, everything else suffers.Afew years back, these realities were dawning on the states leaders. Even Lockyers reform on our terms speech was in the context of needing to reform. California faced a general-fund budget mess, and although only a small portion of the budget directly goes toward pension payments, it highlighted the problem to voters.In June 2012, the electorates in the states second- and third-largest citiesSan Diego and San Joseapproved significant pension-reform initiatives. Both cities have solid Democratic voting majorities, but both measures passed with around 70 percent support. San Joses Democratic Mayor Chuck Reed pointed to his citys 350-percent increase in pension costs over the past decade and to the declining public services. He championed the citys reform as a model that could be followed in other struggling California cities.Indeed, the publics concern over pension debt was so noticeable that polling showed it endangering Governor Jerry Browns signature initiative for the November ballota large tax hike to help fill a red-ink-stained budget. Voters wondered why they should entrust this government with more of their money if it wasnt even tackling the problem of big debt.Late in the session, the governor and legislature threw together a modest pension reform bill that basically ended the practice of pension spiking inflating a public employees final salary to enhance his retirement payments for life. It was political window-dressing that helped Brown and his fellow union-backed legislators get their tax hike. They since have echoed the dishonest mantra: we reformed pensions and the system is fine!Theyve also since claimed to have fixed the debts faced by the states second-largest pension fund, the California State Teachers Retirement System, or CalSTRS. Because of complex statutory reasons, CalSTRS is dependent on the legislature to backfill any losses, whereas CalPERS can simply raises its contribution rates on participating cities.It became clear that CalSTRS would go belly up in thirty years if the legislature didnt start sending another $5 billion or so its way annually. So Brown and company concocted another plan to ratchet up state contributions. But it, too, was largely phony. Under the plan, the state sends a pittance extra each year to CalSTRS, with the really large bumps in contributions pledged to take place years from now when it will be someone elses problem.Frankly, Brown, Democratic legislative leaders, and even the courts have been doing everything to derail any manner of reform.The courts gutted the most significant part of the San Jose initiative. And while San Diego continues to implement its reform, Browns appointees to the union-controlled Public Employment Relations Board have been suing the city to stop the voter-approved measure. PERB claims the public vote was illegal because the city first had an obligation to negotiate with the unions representing the new workers who will face lower benefit levels. Union demands even trump the right to vote, in the administrations view.Furthermore, a judge in Ventura County pre-emptively halted an election that would have asked voters to reform that countys pension system. CalSTRS did pass a reform that required teachers to pitch in a little more toward their pensions (in exchange for vesting other benefits, given that it is illegal in California to reduce public-employee benefits without giving something equal or greater in exchange).In late August, the CalPERS boardyou know, the same board run by union activists and union-controlled politiciansvoted on a measure that effectively obliterates even the modest pension reform that Brown and company passed as a tax-raising window dressing.Heres how it works: Currently, existing state and local employees get all sorts of special pay. There are ninety-nine extra-pay categories, most of which should induce mockery and anger. Librarians, for instance, are paid extra for helping library patrons find books. Police are paid extra for driving alone in patrol cars. Fire chiefs get special management pay. Gardeners get paid extra for fixing sprinklers. Those categories have existed since the 1990s, but a few years ago CalPERS decided that they should also be used when its time to calculate an employees pensionthereby inflating the final base pay and ensuring higher pension benefits for many years to come.Browns ballyhooed reform applied only to new hires. So the CalPERS board passed regulations that allow these ninety-nine categories to be used in a pension-spiking bonanza for these new hires, too. It seemed like a giant middle finger to Brown, although the governors reaction suggests that he wasnt upset by the scam.Brown is joined at the hip with the unions, even if he talks a good game about fiscal responsibility. He claimed to be outraged by the CalPERS decision, but of the ninety-nine categories used in the scheme, he said that he only objected to one. He has yet to follow even this half-hearted protest with any serious action. In other words, he seems fine with a CalPERS rule that destroys any gains made by his own pension reform, even as he championed an end of pension spiking during his gubernatorial debate.It keeps getting worse. In September, the California Supreme Court gave CalPERS the OK to sue credit-rating giants Moodys and Standard & Poors for hundreds of millions of dollars over the top ratings they gave to investments that collapsed in 2007-08, reported the San Francisco Chronicle.CalPERS is blaming the credit agencies for its poor performance, which has led to higher-than-expected unfunded pension liabilities. This really is something when you consider what CalPERS has been promising taxpayers over the past many years. In 1999, for instance, CalPERS pressured the legislature to pass a massive pension increaseand to do so quickly and without all the normal committee hearings and vetting sessions. That CalPERS action has led to the bulk of the states current pension problems.The law, SB 400, boosted California Highway Patrol pensions by 50 percent, instituting that 3 percent at 50 pension formula mentioned above. Legislators did so retroactivelymeaning that even officers a day away from retirement got the boost going back to the day they started working. The law practically begged local governments to follow suit. I recall when even in conservative Orange County, Republican legislators tripped over themselves to offer the huge pension increase.As Crane said in his senate testimony: Promising that no increase over current employer contributions is needed for these benefit improvements, and that CalPERS would remain fully funded despite the increases, the CalPERS Proposal claimed that enhanced pensions would not cost taxpayers a dime because investment returns would cover the expense. Instead, it led to massive debts, billions of dollars in taxpayer expense, and obliterated public services.Crane noted that CalPERSs promises would have required the Dow Jones to reach roughly 25,000 by 2009 and 28,000,000 by 2099 for no such deficiencies to rise. He reminded senators that CalPERS never disclosed that its own employees would receive these massive pension increases.CalPERS is suing the credit agencies, but no one is holding CalPERS accountable for the false information it provided in the capitol.California pension reformers continue to come up with new ideas to rein in out-of-control spending, to protect public services, and to create a generous but sustainable system. Every poll and indication shows that even the states Democratic electorate supports these efforts. A number of Democratic local officials such as San Joses mayor have the courage to try to reform their local systems. They are stymied at every turn by the union machine, and though they are a hardy group and they keep regrouping, its looking fairly hopeless.Bankrupt cities are desperately afraid of standing up to CalPERS and its enormous political and legal might. Efforts to go around the machine and take the matter directly to voters via a statewide ballot measure cannot get past the union favoritism. For instance, state Attorney General Kamala Harris gets to author the titles and summaries for all statewide ballot measures. Twice now, she has given such unfair ballot summaries to pension initiatives that even liberal editorial boards argued that they sounded as if they were written in the union hall.What to do? In a recent verbal ruling, the federal judge overseeing Stocktons bankruptcy said that pensions are not protected when cities go bankruptthe first good news in a long time. Its the only hope left to keep California from being doomed to a slow destruction of its public services and an ever-increasing tax burden to fund these lush retirements. But maybe politicians and voters in other states can take heed of the situation and learn that all is lost once the looters are given complete control of the treasury.

The American Spectator,C,Opinions Versus Facts | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Everyone seems to have an opinion about the tragic events in Ferguson, Missouri. But, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan used to say, Youre entitled to your own opinion but youre not entitled to your own facts.Soon after the shooting death of Michael Brown, this 285-pound young man was depicted as a gentle giant. But, after a video was leaked, showing him bullying the owner of a store from which he had stolen some merchandise, Attorney General Eric Holder expressed displeasure that the video was leaked. In other words, to Holder the truth was offensive, but the lie it exposed was not.Many people who claimed to have been eyewitnesses to the fatal shooting gave opposite accounts of what happened. Some even gave accounts that contradicted what they themselves had said earlier.Fortunately, the grand jury did not have to rely on such statements, though some in the media seemed to. What the grand jury had, that the rest of us did not have until the grand jurys decision was announced, was a set of physical facts that told a story that was independent of what anybody said.Three different medical forensic experts  one representing Michael Browns parents  examined the physical facts. These facts included the autopsy results, Michael Browns DNA on the door of the police car and on the policemans gun, photographs of the bruised and swollen face of policeman Darren Wilson, and the pattern of blood stains on the street where Brown was shot.This physical evidence was hard to square with the loudly proclaimed assertions that Brown was shot in the back, or was shot with his hands up, while trying to surrender. But it was consistent with the policemans testimony.


Moreover, the physical facts were consistent with what a number of black witnesses said under oath, despite expressing fears for their own safety for contradicting what those in the rampaging mobs were saying.The riots, looting, and setting things on fire that some in the media are treating as reactions to the grand jurys decision not to indict the policeman, actually began long before the grand jury had begun its investigation, much less announced any decision.Why some people insist on believing whatever they want to believe is a question that is hard to answer. But a more important question is: What are the consequences to be expected from an orgy of anarchy that started in Ferguson, Missouri, and has spread around the country?The first victims of the mob rampages in Ferguson have been people who had nothing to do with Michael Brown or the police. These include people  many of them black or members of other minorities  who have seen the businesses they worked to build destroyed, perhaps never to be revived.But these are only the first victims. If the history of other communities ravaged by riots in years past is any indication, there are blacks yet unborn who will be paying the price of these riots for years to come.Sometimes it is a particular neighborhood that never recovers, and sometimes it is a whole city. Detroit is a classic example. It had the worst riot of the 1960s, with 43 deaths  33 of them black people. Businesses left Detroit, taking with them jobs and taxes that were very much needed to keep the city viable. Middle class people  both black and white  also fled.Harlem was one of many ghettos across the country that have still not recovered from the riots of the 1960s. In later years, a niece of mine, who had grown up in the same Harlem tenement where I grew up years earlier, bitterly complained about how few stores and other businesses there were in the neighborhood.There were plenty of stores in that same neighborhood when I was growing up, as well as a dentist, a pharmacist and an optician, all less than a block away. But that was before the neighborhood was swept by riots.Who benefits from the Ferguson riots? The biggest beneficiaries are politicians and racial demagogues. In Detroit, Mayor Coleman Young was one of many political demagogues who were able to ensure their own reelection, using rhetoric and policies that drove away people who provided jobs and taxes, but who were likely to vote against him if they stayed. Such demagogues thrived as Detroit became a wasteland.COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,How Sovereign Patent Trolls Threaten Free Trade  | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Daniel Foster (Flickr Creative Commons)Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter The U.S. is participating in two trade agreement negotiations that, if successfully concluded, will meaningfully improve our nations economic future. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would create a trade agreement amongst Pacific Rim countries including the U.S., Japan, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a trade agreement being negotiated between the U.S. and our allies in the European Union.
While the negotiations will discuss many issues there is a growing trade impediment that should also be addressed  state sponsored patent trolls, officially known as Sovereign Patent Funds (SPFs).
Like other patent trolls, SPFs exploit loopholes in the current patent system for the sole purpose of extorting royalties from innovators who are actually using the new technology in their production processes.
Patents, of course, serve a valuable purpose  they enable the creation of better products, new markets, and new technologies.
Invention is a long, costly, and risky process. The process invokes images of Alexander Graham Bell or Thomas Edison passionately risking everything  their time, their money, and their reputation  in the pursuit of making the currently impossible, possible. And, our modern economy owes its very existence to the efforts of pioneers who have willingly traversed this difficult path.
While invention is hard, copying an invention is relatively cheap and easy. Without some legal protection against imitators, inventors face an insurmountable problem. Imitators have not invested the time and costs (nor borne the risks) that a products inventors have. With lower cost structures, imitators are able to undercut the prices charged by inventors, severely diminishing the incentive for innovation.



Patents, in many instances, solve this problem: patents empower inventors to earn a financial return that is sufficient enough to compensate these innovative entrepreneurs for the money they invested and the risks they endured. When used for these purposes, patents help establish new markets for goods and services that would have been unheard of just a few years earlier  smartphones being the quintessential example.
But, there is a dark side to this beneficial process  patent trolls.
Patent trolls impose a significant economic cost on the U.S. economy and targets the economys most productive sectors  such as the telecommunications and computer industries. According to William Watkins of the Independent Institute, the lawsuits filed by patent trolls has already destroyed more than $500 billion worth of wealth between 1990 and October 2010.
SPFs worsen an already disturbing problem. SPFs rely on tax dollars to seed their operations  lowering their operating costs and creating a subsidy that allows state sponsored patent trolls to pursue even more dubious patent claims.
Government Sponsored Patent Trolls also have a mission beyond the fleecing of productive companies in order to earn a profit. By targeting foreign companies, SPFs raise the operating costs of foreign competitors relative to their domestic champions. These actions create a subsidy for domestically-based companies while handicapping foreign competitors  and if the SPF is lucky, it will also earn a hefty payout.
Unlike other non-tariff trade barriers, government sponsored patent trolls will adversely affect foreign competitors profitability not just in the country imposing the anti-free trade policies. By raising the overall costs of doing business, a companys overall global operations can be adversely impacted. Consequently, the negative impacts on trade and economic growth including less job creation, slower income growth, and diminished consumers benefits are all amplified.
Unfortunately, the use of SPFs is growing. For instance, Taiwan has a SPF called the Industrial Technology Research Institute, which holds nearly 19,000 patents! In South Korea, the SPF is known as Intellectual Discovery, while the Innovation Network Corporation performs the state sponsored patent troll function in Japan.
Not to be outdone, China has seeded its version of the state-run patent troll  the Ruichuan IPR Funds  with $50 billion. And, state sponsored patent trolls are not confined to Asia either. France has created France Brevets, which operates with the same purpose as its Asian counterparts  to acquire patents from targeted jurisdictions across key high-technology industries.
SPFs are a means for governments to exploit gaps in the patent system in order to disadvantage companies from other countries. Not only is this practice unfair, it diminishes the vibrancy of the most innovative sectors of the global economy and makes us all poorer.
Due to the negative consequences of SPFs, the U.S. should push for the dissolution of SPFs in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations.
Instead of joining the patent trolls, the best way for any government to promote growth is to leverage opportunities such as the TPP and TTIP trade agreements and promulgate rules that foster innovation and encourage greater entrepreneurship.

The American Spectator,C,Rainy Day Rage | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter TuesdayWhat a dreadful day. The rain, for which we had all prayed, has made traffic a nightmare. Plus, it is just strange to wake up and have the sky dark. That has not happened in a long time. There are the palm trees and the jacarandas, but no blue skies. No candy. Just gray clouds down to the deck and an incessant rain. I have to fight to remind myself to be grateful. Thats how stupid I am. I have everything but I am still too stupid and selfish to be grateful when something I desperately need comes along.I did errands for most of the day. Then I went to buy some iced tea for my wife at the Pavilions. I was waiting for a parking space when a man in a truck started to back up rapidly towards me. I honked at him and he stopped. He glared at me, then pulled into a space near me. He walked towards me.As I got out of my car, I said to him, Im sorry for beeping at you, but you were backing up towards me. I beg your pardon.No. You did it because youre stupid and youre selfish and you couldnt wait a minute for me to park my car. Thats how stupid you are, screamed the man, who was about forty, I would say, and about six foot six and REEKING of alcohol.I am so sorry, I said again, but I was not the one who was beeping at you to hurry up. That was another driver. I just didnt want you to hit me.


No, he shouted. Youre an idiot. I know who you are and youre an idiot.He scared me and I thought for a moment of calling 911. I think its illegal to start screaming provocative words at someone out of the blue. Maybe I saw that on COPS. I was very glad that I was not armed because I could imagine the temptation to shoot when scared.However, the man walked away from me and I had an idea. That guy is going to key my car, I thought. So I retraced my steps to my car and parked it far away from his truck. That parking lot of the Pavilions at Robertson and Santa Monica is Ground Zero of crazy people. It is the anti-Greenville. The anti-Sandpoint. Loaded with wildly anxious, nutty, and high people.At home, I opened some bills. One of them was for immense charges for my sons family in said Greenville. It was for so much money it made my head spin. There was also a good chunk for my wifes (literally) dozens of animal charities. I was furious. I dont want to go broke because I am supporting my sons family as if I were a maharajah. I dont want to go broke helping the zebras. I yelled at my wife about it. She took it with head hung in shame and, of course, I felt like killing myself.I am sorry, I said. Its not anything bad youve done. Its all my fault for allowing so many people to live off me so lavishly. All my fault.She looked so thin, so frail, so guilty, I felt like shooting myself. I apologized much more. Then I slept, woke, and paid more bills. Thousands and thousands for vet bills and animal charities. Obviously, we will wind up broke. Its clear-cut.My wife is living in a dream world, I said to myself and then I laughed. If she were not at least partly crazy, she wouldnt stay with me. The price I pay and its a small one, is those tens of thousands a month in credit card bills. Well worth it to have my glorious wifey.As to the man at the Pavilions parking lot I am glad I am not he. Some day someone much less careful than I am will plug him. Or maybe hell become mayor of New York. Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,The Rehabilitation of Rick Perry | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Flickr Creative CommonsSend to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Three years ago, a Texas reporter named Jay Root set out to chronicle the behind-the-scenes maneuvers that would land Governor Rick Perry in the White House. He couldnt have guessed that, in the end, the story wouldnt have much to do with ad buys or endorsements or personality conflicts. The real event, of course, played out in public, in the on-stage meltdown that gave Root the title of his 2012 e-book: Oops!Yet that unforgettable moment when, during a nationally televised debate, Perry could recall only two of the three cabinet departments he proposed to eliminate, was just the final indignity in a short campaign full of them. Remember that ad in which Perry complained that gays can serve openly in the military, but our kids cant openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school, or the parodies it provoked? How about that rambling, free-and-easy speech Perry gave in New Hampshire that caused everyone to assume he was either drinking or still taking painkillers from his back surgery three months earlier? It was, according to James Carville, the worst campaign in American history.But it turns out there may have been a behind-the-scenes explanation after all. Perrys campaign had insisted all along that he wasnt taking painkillerswhich might have been the problem. According to Roots reporting, the governor was a sleep-deprived zombie in the fall of 2011, thanks to back, leg, and foot pain, not to mention sleep apnea. He hadnt recovered from the surgery as fast as hed hoped. The morning before one debate, Perry told an aide: I didnt sleep a wink.Then he went onstage and said this:I think Americans just dont know sometimes which Mitt Romney theyre dealing with. Is it the Mitt Romney that was on the side of against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment? Was it was before he was before the social programs, from the standpoint of he was for standing up for Roe v. Wade before he was against verse Roe v. Wadehe was for Race to the Tophes for Obamacare and now hes against itI mean well wait until tomorrow and, and, and see which Mitt Romney were really talking to tonight.Even that teen Miss South Carolina had to cringe.But if you go back and watch the clips now, you can see the bags under Perrys eyes. At the time Texans were baffled to see Perry so baffled. This is not the governor theyve been watching for fourteen years now. Around here, Perrys known for bluff and bluster, not delirium. Texans just dont do shambolic.Perrys job now is to obliterate the nations first impression of him, and hes been hard at work on that: talking about marijuana decriminalization with Jimmy Kimmel; showing up on the Sunday morning talk shows and in the New York Times Magazine; touring the border with Sean Hannity; visiting Iowa four times in eight months; picking a fight over foreign policy with Rand Paul in the op-ed pages of the Washington Post.Much hay has been made of the governors new look, including the square-framed glasses he has been sporting lately. Rick Perrys run for the Republican presidential nomination was, arguably, doomed when he couldnt count to three, jabbed Noreen Malone in the New Republic. Is it any wonder that since the summer, Perrys been appearing in public wearing hipster-professorial glasses? Now this looks like a man who could remember at least ten pieces of information. More potshots came when word broke that Perry, hoping to alleviate continuing back pain, had decided to take off his cowboy boots for good. Tell Rick that boots can be purchased with normal heels, Texass state land commissioner quipped to a reporter. I lament the fact that our governor could now pass for a West Coast metrosexual and has embarrassed us all with his sartorial change of direction.Dress shoesnerdy spectaclesdoes this all add up? When reporters ask Perry whether hes running for president, he doesnt play coy. Its a possibility. Im not going to ride off into the sunset. Over the last eighteen months, I have focused on being substantially better prepared.That preparation has included long meetings with scholars at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution and most of the major conservative think tanks. Avik Roy, whose brilliant work for the Manhattan Institute and Forbes earned him a spot advising Romney on health care policy, has been meeting with the governor, too. I think that the media is underestimating GovernorPerry, Roy says. IfPerrydoes decide to run in 2016, I bet he surprises a lot of people with how improved he is as a candidate.Mark P. Jones, chair of the political science department at Rice University, thinks Perry will run, foremost, to restore his national reputation. The next twenty years will be a lot more pleasant for him if he never has to hear the word oops again. While it is quite unlikely that Perry will win the GOP primary or the presidency, Jones says, he can still emerge from the 2016 primary process as a winner by running a solid and respectable campaign and therein largely erase the less than flattering image created by his failed 2012 bid.Perrys most obvious asset, in a time when polls show that voters still care more about jobs than just about anything else, is the fact that the Lone Star State is booming. The governor travels the countryparticularly in overregulated, slow-growth states with Democratic governorstalking up Texas, and his tours have sealed the popular image of the state as hospitable to business. (Although theres still work to be done: Texas ranked thirtieth in regulatory freedom in the most recent Freedom in the 50 States study by the Mercatus Center.)Democrats have tried to challenge the idea that Texas is an economic powerhouse, but they keep failing for reasons the journalist Erica Grieder lays out in her book Big, Hot, Cheap, and Right: What America Can Learn from the Strange Genius of Texas. The most common misconception is that the states numbers are inflated by the oil and gas boom, but Greider cites data from June 2011when the Texas oil and gas industry was at a high pointthat show the industry accounted for just 13 percent of job growth.Some Democrats also try to argue that low unemployment in Texas just means a surfeit of badly paying jobs, but theyre misreading the effects of mass immigration by unskilled laborers. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas put out a report in March showing that from 2000 to 2013, Texas has been the engine of middle-class job creation for the entire country. The rest of the United States added to the payrolls in the top and bottom wage quartiles, but actually lost 720,000 jobs in the lower-middle and upper-middle brackets. On the other hand, Texas created 811,000 middle-class jobs (out of some two million in all).


Democrats also cry that the Texas modellow taxes, low government servicesleaves too many out in the cold. But the skies in Houston are blue, whatever youve heard. The schools do reasonably well, considering the large population of English language learners, and they do it for very low cost.Its true that a quarter of the population has no health insurance, but this could actually help Perry in the primary, given the unpopularity of Obamacare. You can trust that he truly does not think its his job to insure everybody. Unlike more than a handful of other GOP governors who have folded to demands to expand Medicaid, Perry makes the case that the program is broken, given that several studies have found that Medicaid patients suffer worse outcomes than the uninsured.Instead, Perrys approach to health care has been to try to lower costs, in part by limiting malpractice damages with a 2003 tort reform law that attracted so many doctors that even the New York Times took notice. At a speech I caught recently, he told the story of a doctor who had moved his practice from Arizona to Texas, thereby cutting his malpractice insurance costs from $77,000 a year to $7,000. We are now approaching 34,000 more licensed physicians in the state of Texas than in 2003, Perry told Texas Monthly recently. In a process that mystifies so many liberals, the increase in supply has kept prices down. Between 2003 and 2009, insurance premiums in Texas grew between 33 and 44 percent slower than in Massachusetts, according to a comparison Roy conducted. The Perry-led reform of Texas medical malpractice system yielded dramatic results, Roy concluded.That focus on the bottom line isnt limited to the doctors office. During Perrys time as governor, the states budget has stayed roughly in line with inflation and population growth. The credits not all his: Texas has a weak governors office, the legislature is controlled by Republicans, and low taxes, with correspondingly reduced public services, have a long history. Still, its a track record of fiscal restraint that none of his competitors can match.Some of Perrys efforts to grow the economy, however, might not sit well with primary voters. The governor has convinced the legislature to put a billion dollars at his disposal in two economic development accountsslush funds, reallycalled the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund. A state audit of the Enterprise Fund published in late September found staggeringly weak controls: hundreds of millions of dollars given away without applications or formal assurances that jobs would be created. By contrast, a proper job-creation program may give away just as much on empty promises, but it fills out all the forms correctly. The Austin political class, even the guys who helped Perry run it, feigned outrage, but that sort of crony capitalism has deep roots in the state. A New York Times investigation in 2012 found that Texas leads the nation in corporate welfare, with some $19 billion in giveaways each year.Perry says the funds help close deals and create jobs. Lately, hes been talking up a $40-million payment to Toyota, which recently agreed to relocate its 4,000-employee headquarters to a Dallas suburb. Toyota, however, is the rare company that couldnt even pretend to be grateful for the sweetener, which amounted to a rounding error in the companys $23 billion profit margin for the year. A Toyota spokeswoman told the Houston Chronicle that the incentive wasnt one of the major reasons for the move, and its CEO for North America told the newspapers that he wanted headquarters to be closer to the companys plants. At any given moment, there are going to be some companies moving into Texas, says Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First. What happens is he sees a few high-profile relocations, like Toyota, and he jumps to the front of the parade.The companies that Perry can more credibly claim to have lured with incentives and subsidies are responsible for a small fraction of the states job creation. LeRoy cites data for the first seven years of the Perry administration showing that Texas imported 28,375 jobs from other states, which is a gain of just 0.23 percent. Almost all the net job creation over time comes from expansions and start-ups, LeRoy says. Hes clearly using a natural market eventhes presiding over a large state economyand hes using it for political gain.For years now, Republicans have blurred the distinction between pro-market and pro-business, nowhere more than in Texas. There are signs that this is changing. In June, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost a primary election in Virginia to an unknown economics professor named Dave Brat, who ran a populist campaign against crony capitalism. The partys leadership in Washington seems to be taking the message halfway seriously; for a minute it even looked like a few rowdy backbenchers had convinced their leadership to kill off the Export-Import Bank, which exists mainly to subsidize the exports of large American corporations.The anger over crony capitalism might just be a Tea Party thing, but Jon Bond, a political science professor at Texas A&M, points out that the Tea Party is supposed to be Perrys base. The governor is supposed to be the guy that appealed to Tea Party conservatives, but he had political credentials that appealed to the Republican establishment. Will voters figure out that so-called economic development is mostly just a multi-billion scam that lets politicians take credit for job creation?However modest Perrys chances might seem, two recent events seem to be pushing the narrative right in his direction. The first, of course, is the governors ongoing legal troubles. In September, Perry was indicted for vetoing the funding of the Travis County District Attorneys Public Integrity Unit after its chief proved herself less interested in public integrity and more interested in public drunkenness. When shes sober, D.A. Rosemary Lehmberg fires assistants who refuse to lie to internal affairs investigators and persists in unethical vendettas against Republicans such as Tom DeLay long after theyve been exonerated. When shes drunk, she drives all over the road, and then berates and threatens the officers who arrest her.Yall are gonna be in jail, not me, she said at one point during her infamous booking video. You might think thats just the sort of thing lawmakers had in mind when they created a felony for anyone who by means of coercioninfluences or attempts to influence a public servant in a specific exercise of his official power A Travis County grand jury decided, however, that Lehmbergs actions didnt qualify.Then came another Travis County grand jury to say that Perrys actionswhen he vetoed the funding for this dissolute public integrity unit after suggesting that Lehmberg really ought to resigndid count as criminal coercion. The man responsible for this novel legal theory is one Michael McCrum, a former Obama nominee for U.S. Attorney and a very special prosecutor.Perry had been working under the assumption that governors have the authority to veto legislation. Its an easy assumption to make, since the state constitution explicitly allows it, and it has been standard practice nationwide since the founding of the republic. Against this mountain of historical fact we are offered by McCrum a higher, mystical understanding of the law. Like some beardless Jerry Garcia, McCrum got shown the light in the strangest of places by looking at it right. Start with Texas Penal Code section 39.02, which prohibits officials from misusing government property in their possession. The right way to look at it is to let your eyes glaze over, wave your fingers in front of your face, watch the tracers, and then wait for the universe to whisper a secret directly into your soul. Or something. Because its not there in the text. Ive tried squinting five different ways, and still cant see how a law meant to keep bureaucrats from stealing office supplies has anything to do with veto power.Yet McCrum wouldnt be swayed from his hallucinogenic epiphany: this veto was a criminal misuse of government property because it, like, harmed the person who was supposed to get that property. Hes going to blow his own mind when he realizes what that theory means: any veto involving money is a crime. On its face, the idea is absurd, which is why liberals from former Obama advisor David Axelrod to Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz to the New York Timess editorial board have all belittled the indictment.But lets rejoin McCrum on his acid trip and consider the nearly cosmic implications. He realizes that all of the governors have been breaking the law whenever they veto funding, and he must save them. Stop, he cries out. Youre breaking the law. Ill have to bring charges. Then another McCrum materializes to warn our first McCrum that in threatening to accuse and indict the governors, he is illegally trying to influence the exercise of an official power. Then McCrum C shows up to tell McCrum B that he has just illegally attempted to influence McCrum A in the same way. Then D appears. McCrums trip has turned into a nightmare of infinite regression, like those fractal posters and M.C. Escher drawings beloved of acid freaks everywhere.The problem here isnt just McCrum: its bad laws. The Texas legislature meets for just three or four months every other year, and the lack of practice shows in its handiwork. Law professor and free speech expert Eugene Volokh points out that case law indicates coercion is only criminal when the threat itself is unlawfule.g., Let me go or youll be the one in jail!and that statutes reflected that understanding from 1989 until 1994, when the legislature mysteriously and thoughtlessly erased the distinction. A court would have to decide whether the distinction still exists. If it doesnt, then all sorts of lobbying, opinion journalism, and routine politicking are potentially criminal. And thats all Perrys guilty of hereroutine politics.Then theres, the child migrant crisis at the border. Perry has always been able to finesse the immigration issue, pounding border security without alienating the Latino voters who will eventually determine Texass future. In the last primary, the rest of the field tried to seize upon his support for a 2001 state law allowing the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition, and Perry killed his own popularity by insisting that anyone who disagreed with him didnt have a heart. That was a rare misstep. He usually has an intuitive feel for the sweet spot, which Northerners lack: hammer increased security all you want, just dont start talking deportation.When Perry announced in July that he was sending 1,000 National Guard troops to the border, he struck precisely the right balanceeven if that balance meant being perched just over the edge of non-sequiturdom:The plight of these unaccompanied alien children has rightfully captured the national attention as we learn the details of their harrowing journeys. Equally as concerning, however, is the fact that unaccompanied children only make up twenty percent of those crossing the border illegally. And as the brave men and women of our border patrol are pulled away from their law enforcement duties to give humanitarian aid, drug cartels, human traffickers, individual criminals are exploiting this tragedy for their own criminal opportunities.When Brit Hume asked Perry what the point was, given that the troops couldnt arrest anyone, the governor basically admitted that the operation was expensive theatrics. But theatrical doesnt mean frivolous. They need to be right on the river, Perry told Hume. They need to be there as a show of force, because thats the message that gets sent back very quickly to Central America. Perry understands that rumors and perceptions affect migration. Congress may not have understood the significance of its 2008 law requiring most unaccompanied child migrants to be released from custodyit passed unopposedbut Hondurans and Guatemalans sure did. The number of children coming illegally from Central America shot from 3,933 in 2011, to more than 20,000 in 2013, to almost 40,000 in the first nine months of the current fiscal year. Perry may have been the first American politician to notice.Back in May 2012, he wrote President Obama a letter advising him that there had been a 90 percent year-to-year increase in child migrants apprehended over a six-month period. By failing to take immediate action to return these minors to their countries of origin and prevent and discourage others from coming here, the federal government is perpetuating the problem, Perry wrote.The letter seems prophetic now, but the administration didnt even reply to him, more or less dismissing Perry as a grandstander. Other Republican candidates may think they can get to Perrys right on the issue, but all theyll have is their talk, while he will have action and foresight on his side.Not all tough talk is created equal, however. Expressing concern about terrorists from Syria sneaking across the border appeals to hardliners without alienating immigrants, but its also nonsense. Scott Henson, who writes the widely read Texas crime blog Grits for Breakfast, says that Perry tends to use demagoguery as political cover for sensible reforms, at least in the area of criminal justice. Perry trumpets his enthusiasm for the death penalty so often that nobody would think to call him soft on crime, which has allowed him to sign into law dozens of sensible bills that a Bill Clinton or a Gray Davis would never touch. These include laws establishing drug courts and expanding probation, parole, and mental health programs, while closing three state prisons. Hes reformed laws on jailhouse lineups, confidential informants, evidence discovery, and DNA testing. But more than any single law, Perry has ushered in a remarkable period in the history of the state, one in which Texas has begun to come to terms with the excesses of its hang em high jurisprudence.Henson cautions that Perrys role in many of the bills was more passive signer than architect or advocate. Would he push for sentencing reform at the next level? Probably not, based on his record, Henson says. Although, hes owning the criminal justice reform issue much more now than he has during most of his governorship, for what its worth. That wont be enough to get a libertarian to abandon Rand Paul, but its the sort of thing that makes Perry much more appealing than a generic tough-on-crime Republican. He didnt sign those bills because they were good politics; he took a little risk because it was the right thing to do.The same goes for Perry and entitlement reform. He was bold enough three years ago to call Social Security a Ponzi scheme. The way to get votes on that issue is to lie like everyone else. Perrys honesty was treated as just another gaffe by reporters too lazy to look up the trustees reports on Medicare and Social Security.The bottom line is that if Perry can stick around long enough for voters to take a good look at his rsum once jockeying for 2016 begins, hes got a shot at becoming the consensus candidate. He may not inspire the excitement of a Ted Cruz or a Ben Carson, but he could be everybodys second choice. The Texas economy continues to hum along like a well-oiled Toyota. The governor knows how to work the immigration issue without alienating Hispanics. He talks the talk on entitlement reform. If the legal case against him goes to trial, and barring a jury of Forrest Gumps peers, he will be able to brag about having fought the law without the law having won.All Rick Perry needs now is an openingalong with a good chiropractor and some comfortable shoes.

The American Spectator,C,What? Another Conversation About Race? | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
WH.govSend to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Race, you said? A national conversation about race and the variant understandings and byplays that result from our differences? A sit-down in front of the cultural mirror to inspect the origins of community anger, as reflected in riots and police shootings? A talk about  lets get down to it  Ferguson, Missouri?The media are beating that drum, with accompaniment from the White House, where the nations first black (if you like, mixed-race) president held a cabinet meeting Monday, with follow-up gatherings involving parties interested in this sort of thing. The non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson, and the ensuing riots, have set the nation up for an intensive examination of, as usual, white racism.It is easy to predict on the basis of experience, that the conversation, if actually launched, will peter out after observance of the established formalities. The New York Times will highlight the failure of whites to acknowledge that  to quote Times columnist Nicholas Kristof  racial bias remains deeply embedded in American life. Self-deputized spokesmen for blacks will lay out evidence about the economic and educational gap between the races, and about racist cops who take target practice on black males. Americas increasingly upward-bound population of Asians and Hispanics will pay attention for about five minutes before turning to more rewarding pursuits, such as earning a living. White devotees of the New York Times line on race will nod or shake their heads depending on the rhetorical stimuli. The great majority of whites will murmur something akin to: Huh?That would be the Times point; to wit, whites dont understand the ongoing need to liquidate the legacy of slavery, as evidenced in the varied discrepancies between white performance and black performance.


The pitiful thing about this white racism trope, so assiduously pursued by the media, is its  I would say irrelevance just as much as falsity. Dedicated to the proposition that whites dont get it about the racial problem, liberals of different hues, not just black but white, fiddle around with reactionary notions redolent of the ol plantation, where Massa used to set the tone.Disproportionately black public schools, with teaching staffs of dubious quality, no longer cut the pedagogical mustard? Genuine reformers reply: Give the kids a ticket out of that ghetto; let them, at state expense, choose better-performing schools, public or private. Cue, at that point, the fits that teacher unions and their liberal supporters throw at the idea of Abandoning Public Schools, no matter how much in need of overhaul and reform.If 60.2 of whites and only 55.2 percent of blacks currently have jobs, would it not make sense to create more jobs  for all comers  through the relaxation of regulations and the lowering of tax rates that combine to keep unemployment unnaturally high? Take the Keystone pipeline. Better yet: Build the pipeline; lay on the workers, with their paychecks and spending power. Yet the Obama administration sucks up to the white environmentalists who want neither pipeline nor pipeline jobs.The case of Ferguson is unquestionably tragic. Shall I note another tragic element? The collapse of the black family, as foretold by Pat Moynihan half a century ago: mothers and babies left to fend for themselves by fathers not overburdened with moral sensibilities, but largely deprived of the pride and the self-restraint historically taught in the family structure. A possible counter-move on societys part? The revival of moral and religious witness in society at large: the deliberate affirmation  in schools, at home, in entertainment, everywhere  of moral truth as a social good to be grasped and held tight to young chests, for embedding in the heart.But, no; white liberals grow nervous at the notion of exalting universal norms over the intuitions of individuals whose free choice in lifestyles must be affirmed. Until they end up on Action Central News. Rioters protesting a grand jury action attacked police cars and burned and looted stores in the neighborhood where a white policeman, contending his life was in danger, shot and killed a black teenage hoodlum. A good conversational starter, you might say  if we ever decided truly to converse.COPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"
The American Spectator,C,The Search for Racism | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
WhiteHouse.govSend to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter The self-appointed champions of civil rights render the term racism increasingly meaningless. Where juries see self-defense, they see homicidal racial animus. They turn aggressors into victims and demand that society accord the victims the status of heroes, deserving of memorials in public schools, a suggestion that the White House recently touted for Michael Brown.A desire for power, not justice, is driving their protests. Their willingness to commit injustices during the protests underscores their lack of interest in justice. They are perfectly willing to harm innocent people for the sake of attaining power. No justice, no peace is just a slogan for new injustices. It is a slogan that leads to everything from looting and burning down buildings to disrupting traffic with die-ins to throwing police officers in prison for acts of self-defense.It is not that the Ferguson protesters have a good end but select bad means to achieve it. Their end isnt even good. It is simply raw power, and if they got it, they would use that power to commit fresh injustices.This is what makes the national conversation on race so hopeless. It has nothing to do with the truth and couldnt possibly culminate in a better society. The definitions of injustice and racism used in it are bogus. Struggling to find real instances of racism, the organizers of the conversation have to resort to claims of collective racism, which ends up meaning defensible polices with which they disagree. By defining racism so loosely, they can find racism pretty much anywhere and hurl accusations of racism with greater and greater confidence.


Under this shapeless definition of racism, liberals can see racism in opposition to Obamas policies, in questioning of Eric Holder on Capitol Hill, in opposition to affirmative action, in policing of high-crime areas, and so on. If racism is collective, meaning all whites are racist whether they realize it or not, then why not twist a police officers act of self-defense into an act of sinister racism?False accusations of racism are exactly what one should expect in a culture that defines racism so imprecisely. Eric Holder has long encouraged the idea that racism is subtle and that the worst forms of racism are concealed in conservative policies.Urging people to ferret out subtle racism invited debacles in Ferguson and Florida. But Holder didnt care. The protests conformed to his hope that America would cease to be a nation of cowards and eye racism everywhere. Indisputable racism bored him. As he put it once, subtle racism is far more dangerous than outbursts of bigotry. He said the greatest threats do not announce themselves in screaming headlines but lurk in policies that disenfranchise certain groups.Holder should be pleased with this recent story from CNN.com: The new threat: Racism without racists, which quotes a Duke sociologist as saying, The main problem nowadays is not the folks with the hoods, but the folks dressed in suits.""The frantic search for racism under this mindset grows ever more desperate and comically trivial. Author Jacqueline Woodson, for example, solemnly addressed the pain of the watermelon joke, a reference to an inside story a friend of hers, author Daniel Handler, relayed at a recent book awards event. It is hard to find any real racism in the episode. It wasnt even a joke. Hander simply relayed the fact that Woodson is allergic to watermelon and that they had once talked about the rich literary material in that autobiographical detail. But Woodson, not missing her chance at self-important victimhood, writes about the aside in the New York Times as a moment of great trauma: In a few short words, the audience and I were asked to take a step back from everything Ive ever written, a step back from the power and meaning of the National Book Award, lest we forget, lest I forget, where I came from.Handler, true to our propagandized times, has duly accused himself of racism and donated $110,000 to a diversity group in reparations for his high crime.These empty controversies are a perverse measure of racial progress. The civil rights establishment cant find enough authentic racism to stay in business, so it has to turn to self-defense cases and scaremongering about subtle racism for survival.

What is so utterly depressing is that none of the ambiguities that existed in the Ferguson case exist in the Staten Island case. And yet the outcome is exactly the same."" Stewart says. ""We are definitely not living in a post-racial society and I can imagine there are a lot of people out there wondering how much of a society we're living in at all."" Pretty much.

Mother Jones,L,"Unlike Diamonds, E-Books Are Not Forever | Mother Jones","By Kevin Drum| Thu Dec. 4, 2014 9:21 PM ESTTweetEmailMicrosoft is getting a divorce from Barnes & Noble:

On Thursday, the two companies parted ways, with Barnes & Noble buying out Microsoft for about $125 million. In other words, in just over two years, the value of the Nook business has lost more than half its value.
....And yet despite these grim numbers, Barnes & Noble has reason to look favorably on its relationship with Microsoft. The initial $300 million investment gave the bookseller an infusion of cash when it needed it most....Microsoft, meanwhile, was hoping that the Nook software would bolster its own tablet business, making it a more viable competitor to Apples iPad. That didnt pan out, and Microsoft was left committed to a declining Nook business that was adding little to its own ambitions in the tablet market.

This highlights one of the big problems with e-books: what happens when there's no software left to read them? I'm a big user of the Nook app on my Windows tablet, but its demise was announced months ago. Microsoft doesn't care about Nook because it's not a killer app for Windows 8, and B&N doesn't care about Windows 8 because Windows tablets have a minuscule market share. So the app died. For now it still works, but it's inevitable that when upgrades stop, eventually an app stops working for one reason or another. Will I then be able to read my Nook books in some new Microsoft reader? Or will I just be up a creek? There's no telling.
It's weird. I think I now know how Mac partisans used to feel when Microsoft was eating their lunch. They all believed that Macs were obviously, wildly superior to anything from Redmond, and were only on the edge of extinction thanks to massive infusions of marketing by an industry behemoth. Now I'm in that position. After considerable time spent on both iPad and Android tablets, I find my Windows tablet obviously, wildly superior to either one. It's not even a close call. But the market disagrees with me. The few drawbacks of Windows 8, which I find entirely trivial, are deal breakers for most users, and as a result app makers have stayed away. This causes yet more users to avoid the Windows platform and more app makers to stay away, rinse and repeat.
What a shame. I guess I can only hope that by the time Windows tablets are consigned to the dustbin of history there will finally be an Android tablet that's actually usable by adults who want to do more than update their Facebook pages. We'll see.
POSTSCRIPT: Of course, this wouldn't be a problemor not such a big problem, anywayif Amazon and other e-book vendors allowed third-party apps to display their books. But they don't, which means Amazon's monopoly position in e-books also gives them a monopoly position in e-book readers. This is really not a situation that any of us should find acceptable.

Mother Jones,L,"The US Government Deported 438,000 People in 2013. 83 Percent Never Got a Hearing. | Mother Jones","By Julia Lurie| Thu Dec. 4, 2014 6:30 AM ESTTweetEmail American Civil Liberties Union The past couple of weeks have been filled with stories of relieved immigrants: Undocumented parents of American citizens, children who arrived in the United States years ago, and other immigrants without papers can step out of the shadows now that Obama has issued an executive action granting relief to 5 million undocumented residents. (Read more details on the president's plan here.)
But a report released today by the American Civil Liberties Union underscores a troublesome pattern that has received far less attention: Of the 438,421 people deported in 2013, 83 percent received a summary removal, meaning that they were sent to their country of origin by US officials without a hearing. And according to the ACLU's research, many of these removals were illegal: Asylum seekers, unaccompanied kids, and others who may have qualified for relief routinely have been turned away.

Until the mid-'90s, virtually all immigrants at risk of being deported went through an immigration hearing before a judge. But, partly in response to immigration court backlogs, a 1996 law called the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act changed that, extending the ability to issue deportations to immigration officersthe same people who arrest and detain immigrants. Since 2003, the number of immigrantsdeported by officers without a trial hastripled; in fiscal year 2013, according to the ACLU, some 363,000 deportedindividuals ""did not have a hearing, never saw an immigration judge, and were deported through cursory administrative processes where the same presiding immigration officer acted as the prosecutor, judge, and jailor.""
In theory, the current law preventsimmigration courts from being completely inundated while also providing safeguards; officers are to ask individuals if they fear for their lives in their home countries and are seeking asylum, and those who do are to be referred to an officer with asylum training. But according to the ACLU's findings, these protocols aren't often followed: Of 89 interviewees who received summary removals, only 28 percent were asked in a language they understoodif they feared persecution upon returning home. Of those, 40 percent answered ""yes"" but were still summarily removed. An estimated 95 percent of Mexican unaccompanied children have been turned back before seeing a judge.
The ACLU report also documents stories of immigrants for whom expedited deportation was particularly devastating. Below is an excerpt:

Braulia A. and Hermalinda L. were gang-raped and shot after being deported to Guatemala; Braulia's son, who joined her in Guatemala after her deportation, was murdered by the same gang that raped and shot her. Nydia R., a transgender woman who actually had asylum status when she was (twice) deported without a hearing, was attacked by men who raped her and tried to cut out her breast implants; she was then kidnapped and sex-trafficked in Mexico. Laura S. told border officials that she was afraid of her abusive ex-partner; her pleas ignored, she was deported and was murdered by him within days of her removal to Mexico.

As Sarah Mehta, an ACLU human rights researcher and an author of the report, put it, ""Almost every location that we went to across the northern and southern borders had the same stories: of people not knowing what their rights were when they got deported, given a form to sign that they didn't understand, often in a language they didn't know, and essentially pushed across the border. The stories of coercionof mistreatment, of people being threatened with indefinite detention, of people losing their childrenthose stories also were not just a one-off.""
No one, the ACLU included, seems to be able to provide a realistic solution to the immigration court backlog; it's undeniable that if all those requesting asylum were given a trial, the system would be further clogged.
But Obama's recent executive action makes no mention of eliminating illegal summary removalsin fact, it focuses on continuing the ""surge of resources"" to the border. According to the White House Press Office, ""The President's actions increase the chances that anyone attempting to cross the border illegally will be caught and sentback.""

Mother Jones,L,Meet the Family Behind Latin America's Version of Planned Parenthood | Mother Jones,"By Maddie Oatman| Thu Dec. 4, 2014 6:24 PM ESTTweetEmailA reproductive health class in Bogot, Colombia.  Joana Toro/ZUMA People in the United States have been going to Planned Parenthood for nearly a century, ever since Margaret Sanger opened her first birth control clinic in Brooklyn in 1916. But it wasn't until 1977, after the US had already celebrated Roe v. Wade, that Colombian women had any equivalent organization to turn to. That was the year Dr. Jorge Villarreal started Orintame, a women's reproductive health clinic now credited with inspiring more than 600 outposts across Latin America ""and for reshaping abortion politics across the continent,"" writes Joshua Lang in a story about the Villarreal family, out today in California Sunday.
In the 1950s, botched abortions caused nearly 40 percent of Colombia's maternal deaths.
Jorge Villarreal Meja graduated from medical school in 1952 and soon took the reigns of the obstetrics department at Colombia's national university. During that time, botched abortions caused nearly 40 percent of the country's maternal deaths. ""Women in slum areas were putting the sonda (catheter) inside of them without any sonography,""his daughter Cristina Villarreal told Lang. ""They used ganchas de ropa (coat hangers), anything."" When these women showed up at general hospitals, they were shamed and quickly given basic medical attention at most.
So in 1977, Jorge opened a stand-alone health clinic in Bogot called Orintame. Abortions were illegal, so Orintame had to focus on helping women who were already suffering from bad abortion attempts, or ""incomplete abortions."" Colombians had to wait another thirty years before their mostly Catholic country legalized abortion, under pressure from a coalition that included Cristina Villarreal. (Abortion is now legal in Colombia when a mother's physical or emotional health is in danger.) In the meantime, Orintame continued its mission to heal and empower women, using a sliding-scale payment model in order to reach poorer clients. In 1994, Cristina assumed leadership of the organization, which had grown to include a second nonprofit to help doctors around Latin America open their own Orintame clinics.
Not unlike the volatile abortion politics in the US, across Latin America, ""for every political action, there seems to be an equal but opposite reaction.""
Lang's story, an eye-opening and educational read, details the Villarreals' persistence in the face of police and priests, health administration raids, legal battles, money troubles, and social stigma. Not unlike the volatile abortion politics in the US, across Latin America, writes Lang, ""for every political action, there seems to be an equal but opposite reaction,"" making Orintame's success ""all the more unlikely."" Today, the organization continues to struggle for funding. But fortunately for the estimated 4.5 million women seeking abortions every year across Latin America, and countless others looking for reproductive guidance, Orintame's network has already laced together a much-needed safety net that will be difficult to undo.

Mother Jones,L,I Told a Grand Jury I Saw a Cop Shoot and Kill an Unarmed Man. It Didn't Indict. | Mother Jones,"By David Corn | Thu Dec. 4, 2014 12:14 PM ESTTweetEmail Joe Belanger/ShutterstockMany years ago, during the 1980s, I witnessed a killing: a New York City cop shooting an unarmed homeless man near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I was later called as a grand jury witness in the case. The grand jury did not indict the officer.
It was a summer evening. I was heading to play softball in Central Park. At the corner of Fifth Avenue and 79th Street, I got off my bicycle to walk toward the Great Lawn. The west side of Fifth was crowded with New Yorkers enjoying the beautiful night. People were streaming in and out of the park. Sidewalk vendors were doing brisk business. The vibe was good. And in the midst of the hubbub, I spotted a fellow wearing dirty and tattered clothing. His hair was filthy, his face worn. It was hard to determine his age. He reminded me of Aqualung. (See this Jethro Tull album cover.) He was carrying a large and heavy rock with both of his hands, pushing his way through the throng, and muttering unintelligible words. I wondered, what's his story? But I didn't give it much more thought.
Most of the people on the corner were not paying attention to him. Those in his direct path, as he lumbered north, did quickly step out of his way. But no one seemed much alarmed by the guy. In New York City, unfortunately, you often saw broken peopleand shrugged them off as just another crazy.
I was about to head down the footpath toward the baseball fields, when I saw a commotion to my right. Several police officersfour or so, I recallwere approaching the man with the rock. And their guns were drawn. As they neared the fellow, he dropped the rock, he then began to run in the same direction he had been walking. The cops were not grouped together; they were spread outin a circle that was drawing tighter. The man, displaying a fair degree of agility, leaped into the street and tried to cut between two of the officers to get away.
Shots were fired. Two or three. Maybe four. And he went down.
The cops surrounded the man. He didn't move. This was no longer a person. This was a body.
I moved closer to the scene. Passersby had stopped to watch. It was still difficult to assess his age. His clothes were a grimy gray. I saw his dirty hands. Both were empty.
Soon police cars and an ambulance arrived. The paramedics did not move fast. They covered the body with a sheet. Several police officers were standing around a female officer. She was in anguish. They were consoling her. It was obvious: She had fired the shots that killed the man.
Her race? She was white. His skin color? I thought it was dark, but it was tough to tell if it was dirt or pigment.
Cops were buzzing about the scene. Flashing lights illuminated this ritzy stretch of Fifth Avenue. On-lookers gawked. And I noticed something that struck me as odd: The police officers were not talking to any of the witnesses. They were talking to each other and the paramedics. I approached one cop and said that I had seen it all. He wasn't impressed and looked at me as if to say, ""So what?"" I had thought the police would want to round up eyewitnesses to the shooting.
""Shouldn't I talk to someone?"" I asked this officer. He nodded his head toward another policeman. I went up to that cop. ""Excuse me, officer,"" I began. ""I saw what happened."" Again, I received a look of disinterest. ""Shouldn't I...."" He cut me off: ""Talk to him."" He was looking at another officer who was barking instructions to other cops.
I tried once more. I approached this officer who seemed to be in charge. ""Officer, I saw...."" He shut me up with a wave of his hand, signaling I should wait. And wait I did, as he directed other cops to do this or do that. The paramedics were preparing to cart off the body. After a few minutes, I went up to this officer again and told him I had witnessed the whole episode.
""Okay,"" he said.
He said nothing else. He didn't ask me for my name. He didn't ask if I would provide a statement. I was surprised by his lack of interest.
""Shouldn't I tell someone what I saw,"" I said.
""If you want to,"" he said, not in an encouraging tone.
""Okay, who do I talk to?"" I ask.
""If you want to make a statement,"" he said, as if I was inconveniencing him and the entire police force, ""you can go down to the station and do it there."" Now I got it: He didn't want my statement, even though he had no idea what I would say. He was not interested in taking my name and contact information. It was my job apparently to make it to the police station on my own, and the station was a mile or so south.
This ticked me off. He was essentially trying to shoo me away. As the paramedics were loading the body on to the ambulance and as the cop who had shot the man was surrounded by her colleagues, I got on my bike and started to ride down Fifth.
At the station, I approached the front desk and told the officer staffing it that I had witnessed the shooting and had been told to come to the station to provide a statement. This fellow looked surprised to see me. He asked me to wait on a bench. I waited. Five minutes, fifteen minutes. I went back to the desk. Yes, yes, I was told, someone will be with you shortly. Another five minutes, another fifteen minutes. Obviously, no one would have minded if I gave up and left.
Sitting next to me in this waiting area was a womanmiddle-aged and white (if that matters)who was also a witness. We probably weren't supposed to compare our accounts, but we did. (No one had told us not to.) She mentioned that she thought she had seen the victim holding something in his hand, perhaps a knife, when he started to run. Her vantage point had not been as good as mine, and I told her that I had seen the man drop the big rock and immediately begin to run. There had been no time for him to pull out a knife. Moreover, I had been in a position to see his handsbefore and after he was killedand I saw no knife. We looked at each other and didn't know what else to say.
Finally, a detectiveI think he was a detective, he didn't saycame over and gave me a form on a clipboard and asked me to write a statement of what I had seen. I did. I stuck to the facts: nutty-looking homeless man carrying a small boulder, approached by cops, drops rock and runs, cops get closer, he darts between two of the officers, cop fires on him.
It was clear to me that the officer did not have to shoot the man. He was not threatening the officers. He was trying to run from them. But I didn't write down this conclusion. I presented the facts; I believed their implication were undeniable.
When I finished, I handed my statement to one of the officers. I was told, ""You'll be contacted, if that's necessary."" None of my interactions with the police led me to believe that a thorough investigation was in the works.
As I left the station, I saw the female officer who had fired the fatal shots. She was with several colleagues. She was upset and appeared to be crying. The other cops were being supportive. I couldn't help but feel sorry for her. My interpretation was that she had screwed up; she had overreacted or panicked and fired her shots too soon. My hunch was that she knew that.
The next daythis was long before the internet eraI checked the newspapers and saw no stories on the shooting. Some time laterI think it was a couple of monthsI received a call. A grand jury was examining the shooting, and my presence was requested.
I went to the courthouse at the appointed hour and waited to be called into the grand jury room. My time in the drab conference room with the grand jury was brief. The jury was, as they say, a diverse group. But most of the jurors looked bored. A few seemed drowsy. The prosecutor asked me to identify myself and certify I had filed the statement. He asked me to describe where I had been and whether I had seen the full episode. But he never asked me to provide a complete account. The key portion of the interview went something like this:
Prosecutor: You saw him start to run?
Me: I did.
Prosecutor: Did you see anything in his hand?
Me: No.
Prosecutor: Did you see him holding a knife?
Me: No. But I....
Prosecutor: Thank you.
I had wanted to say that I had seen him drop the heavy rock and bolt and that it was unlikely he had been able to grab and brandish a knife while sprinting. And I thought the grand jurors should know that he had not charged at any of the officers; he had been trying to dash through an opening between two of the cops in order to flee. And if they were interested in my opinion regarding the necessity of firing on him, I would have shared that, too.
But the prosecutor cut me off. He didn't ask about about any of this. And not one of the jurors asked a question or said anything.
I left the room discouraged. This was not a search for the truth. It appeared to be a process designed to confirm an account that would protect the officer who had killed the man. The prosecutor was in command and establishing a narrative. (A knife!) The jurors appeared to be only scenery. (Insert your own ham sandwich reference here.) Long before the present debate spurred by the non-indictments in the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases, it seemed clear to me that the system contained a natural bias in favor of police officers. That certainly makes sense. Police officers have damn tough and dangerous jobs, and they are going to look out for their comrades-in-blue who slip up. And prosecutors work closely with cops to rack up convictions, and they don't want to alienate their law enforcement partners. No one in that grand jury room was there to serve the interests of the dead guy.
On the way out of the courthouse, I realized I did not know the name of the victim.
I subsequently called a reporter who worked on the metro desk of the New York Times to tell him about my experience, hoping the paper would dig into the case. But I never saw a Times story on it. (At the time, I was working for a magazine that covered arms-control issues and in no position to write about the event. And back then, there was no equivalent to tweeting, blogging, or Facebooking.)
Several weeks, or a month or two, after my grand jury appearance, I called the person who had contacted me about testifying. Whatever happened? I asked. Oh, the man said, the case is over. I took that to mean the officer was not charged. Before I hung up, another question occurred to me. I don't know why I thought about this, but I asked, ""Whatever happened to the body of the man who was shot?"" He was never identified and buried somewhere, he replied. And I wondered, never identified? How hard did they try?

Mother Jones,L,SeaWorld Says It Has to Keep Orcas in Captivity to Save Them | Mother Jones,"The company insists its killer whales help us better understand wild orcas. Scientists say that claim may not hold water.By Tasneem Raja | Thu Dec. 4, 2014 6:00 AM ESTTweetEmailA baby killer whale born on December 2, 2014, swims in a tank at SeaWorld. Courtesy photoSeaWorld Entertainment has had a rough year in the wake of Blackfish, the explosive 2013 documentary about its killer whales, most notably Tilikum, a 12,500-pound male who has fatally attacked two trainers. The film sparked protests at SeaWorld's three marine parks and attendance has been steadily dropping. Kids have petitioned to cancel field trips, musicians like Willie Nelson have nixed concerts, and brands like Taco Bell and Southwest Airlines have cut ties with the company. Lawmakers in California, home to the flagship SeaWorld San Diego, even proposed banning orca captivity in the state. The company's stock price has been sinking; in August, it fell nearly a third in one day.
Advertise on MotherJones.comIn response, SeaWorld has launched a full-on PR counteroffensive. One of its main talking points is science: While slamming Blackfish as unscientific ""propaganda,"" the park asserts that its killer whales provide a rare opportunity to do crucial research. ""We create a controlled setting for science that is impossible to replicate in the wild,"" its website states. ""Whales in SeaWorld's care help science better understand and conserve wild killer whales."" It also notes that the park recently pledged to spend an additional $10 million on orca research.
That's a drop in the bucket of SeaWorld's total budget: Last year, 24 million people visited its 11 parks nationwide, bringing in $1.4 billion. Orcas are undeniably the main draw. SeaWorld trained the original Shamu and owns around half of the roughly 50 orcas living in captivity. Convincing the public that a SeaWorld ticket can help save wild Baby Shamus may be essential to keeping the company afloat.
While slamming Blackfish as unscientific ""propaganda,"" SeaWorld asserts that its killer whales provide a rare opportunity to do crucial research.
Yet independent orca researchers say these arguments don't hold water. ""If SeaWorld didn't exist, would our understanding of wild killer whales be significantly reduced? I think the answer to that is no, it would not,"" says a veteran marine-mammal researcher who works at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""It's a bit like having Walt Disney tell us about mouse biology,"" says Ken Balcomb, founder of the Center for Whale Research and a pioneering orca researcher.
Despite their 24/7 access to killer whales, SeaWorld-affiliated researchers have published relatively few orca studies. Of the four dozen orca-related papers coauthored by SeaWorld-backed researchers over the past 40 years, half were published before 1990, and just seven since 2010. What's more, at least one-third of these papers did not focus on captive whales, but wild populations ranging from Alaska to New Zealand.
Many of the papers cited on SeaWorld's website were coauthored by researchers from the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, a San Diego nonprofit founded in 1963. SeaWorld provides around 10 percent of its roughly $5 million budget. In 2012 and 2013, Hubbs-SeaWorld published 26 papers on topics ranging from abalone genetics to polar bears' hearing; none focused on orcas. SeaWorld also touts its SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund as evidence of its investment in killer-whale science and conservation. However, between 2004 and 2012 the fund spent no more than $550,000 on research focused on killer whales, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Whale and Dolphin Conservation.
Asked for examples of the company's contributions to orca science, SeaWorld vice president of communications Fred Jacobs points to studies on underwater hearing and reproduction, research on dead orcas, and an article on orcas' metabolism published in the online version of Marine Mammal Science last year. But Naomi Rose, a marine-mammal scientist at the Animal Welfare Institute who has studied wild orcas for more than two decades, says that paper doesn't break new ground. ""The issue isn't that we don't know how much fish they need to eat each day,"" she says. ""The issue is we're leaving them with nothing to eat."" Her comments are echoed by other researchers, who say that SeaWorld hasn't contributed much to our understanding of the main threats to wild orcas: overfishing, pollution, and climate change.
""It's a bit like having Walt Disney tell us about mouse biology,"" says Ken Balcomb, a pioneering orca researcher.
SeaWorld has put considerable resources behind one profitable area of scientific research. At the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Reproductive Research Center in San Diego, scientists are developing ""state-of-the-art reproductive technologies,"" such as artificial insemination using cryopreserved whale sperm, to maintain the park's stock of captive animals. SeaWorld points out that it hasn't removed a killer whale from the oceans in more than 35 years. It has successfully bred 31 orcas in captivity since the mid-1980s. Many of these were fathered by the 33-year-old Tilikum, whose disturbing deterioration was depicted in Blackfish.
Todd Robeck, the center's vice president of theriogenologythe study of how animals reproduceargues that SeaWorld's reproductive technology could help the species survive in case of ""drastic population declines."" However, other researchers point out, captive orcas must be trained to donate or accept sperm; no one's ever tried to impregnate a wild whale. Besides, says Rose, there isn't compelling evidence that wild orcas are having trouble reproducing: ""They breed fine. It's surviving once they are born, in a degraded habitat, that is their problem."" Only the population of killer whales off British Columbia and Washington is considered endangered, in part due to the capture of its members by SeaWorld and other parks in the 1960s and 1970s.
In any case, say scientists and conservationists, the study of orcas in the wild is becoming less difficult and less invasive, making captive research less important. Advances in technology, from satellite tagging to biopsy darts, have made it much easier to get detailed data on wild marine mammals. A project headed by University of Washington biologist Samuel Wasser uses a trained dog to detect floating killer-whale feces. ""Whale poop is a gold mine,"" says team member Debbie Giles of the University of California-Davis. ""The best part is this allows us to stay really far from the whales. We don't have to go near them at all, and we can learn incredible amounts of information about them.""
SeaWorld's Robeck says there's another good reason to keep orcas on display: They're ""education ambassadors"" that encourage ""people to think more about the environment and what they can do to help preserve and protect it."" Yet Giles notes that SeaWorld has yet to do the research that could undergird this claim. Visitors may fall in love with the performers at Shamu Stadium, but will they take action to protect wild orcas? ""The onus is on SeaWorld to prove it.""

Mother Jones,L,The Koch 130 | Mother Jones,"How the billionaire brothers have spread their web of influence across every sector of American society.By Julia Lurie, Daniel Schulman, and Tasneem Raja | Mon Nov. 3, 2014 2:58 PM ESTTweetEmail
In 1958, Fred Koch, the founder of the Midwestern oil and cattle ranching empire that would become Koch Industries, became a charter member of the John Birch Society, the fiercely anti-communist organization whose members believed Soviet influence was infecting all aspects of American society. The Birchers attempted to place their weight on ""the political scalesas fast and as far"" as they could, but their movement was quickly sidelined to the ideological fringe. Two of Fred's four sons, Charles and David, have carried forward the conservative torch, and they have succeeded where their father and his allies failed. Their father's company, meanwhile, has grown into a multibillion-dollar conglomerate that is the second-largest private corporation in the country.
Though the Koch surname has become synonymous with political spending, the family's philanthropy has flowed to a wide range of causes. A significant portion has gone to think tanks and policy institutes that advance the brothers' free-market beliefs. And Charles Koch has lavished millions on universities to bolster their study and teaching of this school of economics. But Koch contributions have also established cancer research centers, funded ballets and preserved cultural institutions, and provided grants and scholarships to students.
This project, an effort to track the breadth of the Kochs' philanthropic influence, builds on several years of reporting (which culminated in Dan Schulman's book, Sons of Wichita, and our cover story ""Koch vs. Koch""), news stories, as well as data from tax filings and the organizations' websites. (See more about our methodology below.) What follows is by no means exhaustive. It's the first round of a project that we'll continue to expand and update; please leave suggestions and tips in the comments.

Mother Jones,L,This Pro-Hillary Cowboy Anthem Will Make Your Ears Bleed | Mother Jones,"By Patrick Caldwell| Thu Dec. 4, 2014 11:56 AM ESTTweetEmail Stand With Hillary The 2016 presidential election's stupid season has begun. Sure, it's only been a month since the midterms, but a bevy of super-PACs are already boosting Hillary Clinton's nascent presidential campaign. Three new pro-Hillary groups have been established in the past six weeks, the Washington Post's Matea Gold noted Thursday.
One of those new super-PACs is Stand With Hillary, which debuted by releasing a truly horrendous pro-Hillary country anthem. In the videowhich leans heavily on shots of barns, tractors, and construction workersa bearded cowboy croons about his desire for Clinton to run for president one more time. ""Now it's 2016,"" he sings, ""and this time I'm a thinkin', guys put your boots on and let's smash this ceiling,"" at which point a pane of glass with 2016 written on it is literally smashed with a sledgehammer. Oy vey.

""Don't matter if you're living across this great land in a red or blue state,"" he sings. ""Cuz our American dream is at stake and there's some hard choices that need to be made. We're needing a leader who is tough and ready, who's got vision."" It's left unsaid whether this cowboy favors Clinton for her hawkish foreign policy views, her support of fracking, or her thoughts on parental leave laws.
But purely as a piece of music, this is rubbish. If you want a better country song, try some Blake Shelton. And if you want a song to serve as the soundtrack to Clinton's presidential rerun, it's never a bad time to revisit the 2008 classic ""Hillary4U&Me"":

Mother Jones,L,Grand Jury Doesn't Indict Staten Island Cop in Death of Eric Garner | Mother Jones,"By Ben Dreyfuss| Wed Dec. 3, 2014 2:47 PM ESTTweetEmailUpdate 12/3/2014: Attorney General Eric Holder reportedly told New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio the Department of Justice will conduct a federal investigation into Eric Garner's death, following a grand jury's decision not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo.
A Staten Island grand jury has declined to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner.
The ""no-bill"" decision comes despite the fact that Pantaleo was caught on camera putting Garner in a chokehold during his July 17 arrest.

Cell-phone video of Garners July 17 arrest shows Pantaleo wrestling him to the sidewalk on Bay Street, with the white cops arms wrapped around the neck of the black suspect.
On the ground, Garner was heard repeatedly yelling I cant breathe! as Pantaleo and other cops held him down and handcuffed him.
The Medical Examiners Office ruled Garners death a homicide caused by compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.
Police union leaders denied that Pantaleo used a chokehold  which is banned by the NYPD  and blasted the autopsy as part of a political witch hunt.

The fact that this video exists, that the cop saw it being recorded, that the grand jury watched it and then still declined to indict, should chasten anyone who thinks body cams will be a cure-all for police abuse.

Mother Jones,L,"The Problem With the Ferguson, Ray Rice, and UVA Rape Stories | Mother Jones","By Kevin Drum| Wed Dec. 3, 2014 1:36 PM ESTTweetEmail Ferguson: Christian Gooden/AP; Rice: Jason DeCrow/AP; UVA: Ryan M. Kelly/AP What do these three recent stories have in common?

Ferguson
Ray Rice
The University of Virginia gang rape

One thing they have in common is that I've written little or nothing about them. But they share two other attributes as well. Here they are:

All three have spotlighted problems that are critically important and absolutely deserving of broader attention. Ferguson is all about racial disparities, police killings of unarmed civilians, the militarization of law enforcement, and other equally deserving issues. Ray Rice was about the scourge of domestic violence and its tacit acceptance within the culture of professional sports. The UVA rape story was about sexual assault on university campuses, fueled by alcohol, fraternities, and official lack of concern.
		
However, the specific incidents in all three cases are, to say the least, less than ideal as poster children for these issues. We will never know for sure what happened to Michael Brown, but as evidence has dribbled out, the simple liberal narrative of a gentle teenager being gunned down while trying to surrender has seemed less and less credible. In the Ray Rice case, it's clear that Rice did something terriblebut as it turns out, the evidence suggests that the criminal justice system treated him fairly reasonably and that the NFL's actions were mostly a craven reaction to public opinion. Finally, in the UVA rape scandal, a number of credible questions have been raised about whether Rolling Stone's account of what happened was fairor, in the worst case, even true.

If you're curious about why I've been relatively quiet about these stories, that's why. All of them spotlight issues that I think are well worth spotlighting, and I don't really relish the thought of doing or writing anything that might dilute their power. These are all things that I want people to pay more attention to, not less, and if you want the world to change you have to be willing to exploit the events you have, not the events you wish you had.
And yet, the specific fact patterns of each specific case are genuinely problematic. To pretend otherwise is to be intellectually dishonest.
I've dealt with this by not saying much. That's not exactly an act of moral courage, is it? And yet, with the facts as hazy as they are, I'm just not sure what else to do. Perhaps the answer is to stop worrying about it: Just accept that we live in a messy world and sometimes the events that have the most impact aren't clear cut. But you use the events anyway in an effort to grab public attention and improve the world a bit, even if that sometimes means a few individuals end up being treated unfairly in some way. Perhaps.
I don't knowthough I'm struck that three such similar events have occurred in just the past few months. But I'm still not sure whether I should have reacted differently. I just don't know.

Mother Jones,L,"St. Louis County Police on Tamir Rice Killing: ""Kids Will Be Kids?""  | Mother Jones","By Inae Oh| Thu Dec. 4, 2014 2:19 PM ESTTweetEmailOn Thursday morning, the St. Louis County Police Department took the ill-advised step of deciding to weigh in on the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was killed by a Cleveland police officer last month, with a Facebook post titled, ""Kids will be Kids?""
The post, which the Guardian reported was written by officer Aaron Dilks, urged parents to sit down with their kids and warn them about the dangers of playing with an Airsoft gun. That's the toy gun Rice had in a Cleveland park when 26-year-old rookie officer Tim Loehmann fatally shot him just seconds after pulling into the parking lot. The tragic incident was caught on surveillance video.
""If the type of gun is in question...the Police will respond as though it is a real gun until it can be confirmed one way or the other,"" the post said. It provided instructions for children to follow if they find themselves in a similar situation to Rice: ""Do not run away. They need to no longer have the gun in their hands, throw it away from them.""

That may well be reasonable advice. But the timing of the post, replete with tone-deaf headline, was horrible: Not only did Rice's death come just days after a St. Louis grand jury declined to indict officer Darren Wilson in the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, but this post came within hours of a Staten Island grand jury deciding not to indict the NYPD officer whose choking of Eric Garner led to Garner's death. After all the controversy surrounding its tactics in Ferguson, how could the St. Louis County PD fail to realize that any pronouncements that could be construed as absolving police of the Rice killing would inflame a volatile situation?
The Facebook post, blasted by critics on social media for being insensitive, was removed by late Thursday morning,as was a St. Louis County PD tweet that had promoted it.

Mother Jones,L,Watch NASA Launch Its Next-Gen Spacecraft Friday Morning | Mother Jones,"By Patrick Caldwell| Thu Dec. 4, 2014 3:57 AM ESTTweetEmailThe Orion capsule waiting on the launchpad the day before ignition. NASA/Bill Ingalls Update: NASA had to postpone the launch, which was originally scheduled for Thursday morning, because of a problem with a valve. The next opportunity to test Orion will come early Friday morning. This post has been updated to reflect the change. 
It's been 42 years since a human last traveled outside of low-earth orbit, the barely-out-of-the-atmosphere band of space that communications satellites and the International Space Station call home. But Friday morning, NASA will take a step closer towards once again sending humans to the Moonand perhaps beyond. At 7:04 am, the agency will launch the first unmanned test run of its Orion spacecraft, sending it up from Cape Canaveral for a two-orbit spin around the planeta trip that, if all goes well, will last for 4.5 hours before Orion lands in the Pacific Ocean. You can watch the launch live here or, at the appointed hour, in the video below:

No one will be aboard Orion for the test flight. But the spacecraft, whichis designed to be used for future manned missions to asteroids and eventually the Moon and Mars, is the first NASA capsule since the Apollo program that's designed to send humans beyond low-earth orbit. It is slated to travel 3,600 miles above the planet's surface this weekabout 16 times farther out than the International Space Station.
But it'll be a long time before NASA begins sending humans back out towards the stars. That's due, in part, to the state of rocket science. NASA is using a Delta IV rocket to launch Orion into the sky. But the Delta IV is an older technology that is supposed to be a placeholder until NASA finishes work on the Space Launch System, a larger rocket that will blast the Orion capsule off on long-distance missions. That new system won't be ready until at least 2018, which means a manned mission isn't likely until the 2020s, with a Mars mission not on the docket until the 2030s. (And given the recent frequent delays in long term NASA missions, these dates could easily get pushed back more).
The Orion was originally designed for President George W. Bush's Constellation program, which aimed to return Americans to the moon by 2020 at the latesta step towards a mission to Mars shortly thereafter. President Obama scrapped the Constellation program, which had been underfunded and nowhere near meeting its deadlines, shortly after taking officesparing only the Orion capsule. Space policy has been a low priority for the administration ever since. Obama has left designing a replacement for the Space Shuttle's low-earth-orbit work to the private sector, and hasn't put up much of a fight against objections from congressional Republicans that his plan to send humans to visit an asteroid is expensive and unnecessary.
Orion's launch could be the first step toward a bold new space programor a flashy whimper of a doomed vision. But either way, big rocket launches are always exciting to watch, so tune in here.

Mother Jones,L,"Rep. Peter King Blames Chokehold Death on Eric Garner's ""Obesity"" | Mother Jones","By Inae Oh| Wed Dec. 3, 2014 9:18 PM ESTTweetEmail
Following the announcement Wednesday that a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict the NYPD officer who placed Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold, Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Garner would not have died if he hadn't been so ""obese.""
""If he had not had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died from this, King said. ""The police had no reason to know he was in serious condition.""
The city's medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide and attributed it to the use of a chokehold by officer Daniel Pantaleo. Garner had repeatedly exclaimed ""I can't breathe"" during the arrest, as seen in the video recorded by bystanders. Nevertheless, King questioned whether Garner had pleaded for help, telling Blitzer, ""The fact is, if you cant breathe, you cant talk."" He added: ""I have no doubt if that was a 350-pound white guy, he would have been treated the same.""
King also suggested recently that President Obama invite Darren Wilson to the White House to thank the former Ferguson police officer for doing his job.

Diggles had been arrested and jailed in May 2013over an unpaid $100 parking ticket (which, it turned out, she had been paying in installments.) As you can see in the surveillance video below, at some point officersRicky Grissom and Ryan Cunningham grab Diggles, slam her head on the counter, pull her hair and drag her across the floor by her feet:

According to theTexas Observer,the officers proceeded to drag Diggles into a dark ""detox cell,"" where her lawyers said she spent hours before being strip-searched by another officer. Here's more from the Observer on the aftermath of the attack:

Diggles settled a civil rights lawsuit against the city and the officerslast Decemberfor $75,000. Andless than a month after the incident, Jaspers city council voted to fireCunningham and Grissom. That alone was a stronger response than many allegations of police brutalityget, and Jasper Mayor Mike Lout said the council would work with the district attorney to considercriminal charges against the officers. Lout and other city leaders stressedthat the Diggles case wasn't a sign of some deeper racial divide in the city, but an isolated incident withtheperpetrators swiftly punished.

""We are shocked by the failure of the prosecutor to get an indictment,"" saidCadeBernsen,Diggles' attorney. ""I'm wondering what investigation was done because the video speaks foritself.""
According to records obtained by the Observer, Cunningham was hired to join the Jasper County Sheriff's Office in September.

Mother Jones,L,Thurgood Marshall Blasted Police for Killing Black Men With Chokeholds | Mother Jones,"30 years before the NYPD and Eric Garner, the Supreme Court justice took on the LAPD.By Dave Gilson | Thu Dec. 4, 2014 3:30 PM ESTTweetEmailSupreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in 1977 AP PhotoEarly on the morning of October 6, 1976, 24-year-old Adolph Lyons was pulled over by two Los Angeles police officers for driving with a burned-out tail light. As the facts of the incident were later recounted by Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, ""The officers greeted him with drawn revolvers as he exited from his car. Lyons was told to face his car and spread his legs. He did so."" After an officer slammed his hands against his head, Lyons complained that the keys in his hand were hurting him.
What happened next nearly killed him:

Within 5 to 10 seconds, the officer began to choke Lyons by applying a forearm against his throat. As Lyons struggled for air, the officer handcuffed him, but continued to apply the chokehold until he blacked out. When Lyons regained consciousness, he was lying face down on the ground, choking, gasping for air, and spitting up blood and dirt. He had urinated and defecated. He was issued a traffic citation and released.

Lyons, who was African-American, sued the Los Angeles Police Department for damages and asked a federal judge to enjoin the further use of chokeholds except in circumstances where they might prevent a suspect from seriously injuring or killing someone. Lyons also argued that his constitutional rights had been violated by being subjected to potentially deadly force without due process.
His case, Los Angeles v. Lyons, eventually made it to the Supreme Court. In April 1983, the justices ruled against Lyons 5 to 4. The majority punted on the question of whether chokeholds are constitutional, instead finding that Lyons lacked standing to sue the LAPD since he could not prove that he might be subjected to a chokehold again.
""An LAPD officer described the reaction of a person to being choked as 'do[ing] the chicken.'""
Writing in dissent, Marshall blasted this as absurd: ""Since no one can show that he will be choked in the future, no onenot even a person who, like Lyons, has almost been choked to deathhas standing to challenge the continuation of the policy."" Lyon's lawyer said the ruling turned any encounter with the police into a deadly game of chance. ""The LAPD regulations mean Lyons everyday plays a game of roulette,"" Michael Mitchell said. ""The wheel has 100,000 slots. If the ball should fall in your slot, you die.""
In his opinion, Marshall presented a clear-eyed appraisal of the reckless use of chokeholdsa pattern of abuse most recently illustrated by the choking death of Eric Garner at the hands of a New York City cop. Marshall noted that three-quarters of the 16 people killed by LAPD chokeholds in less than a decade were black. Despite their dangers, LA cops applied chokeholds with indifference: One officer described suspects ""do[ing] the chicken"" while being deprived of oxygen. Officers did not recognize that chokeholds induce a flight response that may be perceived as willful resistance, and trainers did not tell rookie cops that chokeholds can kill in less than a minute.
Some excerpts from Marshall's findings:

Although the city instructs its officers that use of a chokehold does not constitute deadly force, since 1975 no less than 16 persons have died following the use of a chokehold by an LAPD police officer. Twelve have been Negro males []
""Of the nine deathsthe average duration of the choke where specified was approximately 40 seconds.""
It is undisputed that chokeholds pose a high and unpredictable risk of serious injury or death. Chokeholds are intended to bring a subject under control by causing pain and rendering him unconscious. Depending on the position of the officer's arm and the force applied, the victim's voluntary or involuntary reaction, and his state of health, an officer may inadvertently crush the victim's larynx, trachea, or hyoid. The result may be death caused by either cardiac arrest or asphyxiation. An LAPD officer described the reaction of a person to being choked as ""do[ing] the chicken,"" in reference apparently to the reactions of a chicken when its neck is wrung. The victim experiences extreme pain. His face turns blue as he is deprived of oxygen, he goes into spasmodic convulsions, his eyes roll back, his body wriggles, his feet kick up and down, and his arms move about wildly. [...]
The training given LAPD officers provides additional revealing evidence of the city's chokehold policy. Officer Speer testified that in instructing officers concerning the use of force, the LAPD does not distinguish between felony and misdemeanor suspects. Moreover, the officers are taught to maintain the chokehold until the suspect goes limp, despite substantial evidence that the application of a chokehold invariably induces a ""flight or flee"" syndrome, producing an involuntary struggle by the victim which can easily be misinterpreted by the officer as willful resistance that must be overcome by prolonging the chokehold and increasing the force applied. In addition, officers are instructed that the chokeholds can be safely deployed for up to three or four minutes. Robert Jarvis, the city's expert who has taught at the Los Angeles Police Academy for the past 12 years, admitted that officers are never told that the bar-arm control can cause death if applied for just two seconds. Of the nine deaths for which evidence was submitted to the District Court, the average duration of the choke where specified was approximately 40 seconds.

While the case was being considered, the LAPD temporarily suspended its use of the bar-arm hold, where pressure is applied to the windpipe, and the carotid chokehold, where pressure is applied to the carotid artery. (Lyons had been subjected to a carotid hold.) LAPD Chief Daryl Gates also announced that his department was investigating whether carotid chokeholds were more likely to kill African-Americans for physiological reasons. As the chief explained in November 1982, ""We may be finding that in some blacks when it [the hold] is applied, the veins and arteries do not open as fast as they do in normal people.""
Gates hailed the Supreme Court's subsequent ruling in Lyons as vindication that ""this hold is not cruel and inhuman."" The court has yet to reconsider the constitutionality of chokeholds.

Mother Jones,L,The Science of Why Cops Shoot Young Black Men | Mother Jones,"And how to reform our bigoted brains.By Chris Mooney | Mon Dec. 1, 2014 6:00 AM ESTTweetEmail
""You're not, like, a total racist bastard,"" David Amodio tells me. He pauses. ""Today.""
I'm sitting in the soft-spoken cognitive neuroscientist's spotless office nestled within New York University's psychology department, but it feels like I'm at the doctor's, getting a dreaded diagnosis. On his giant monitor, Amodio shows me a big blob of data, a cluster of points depicting where people score on the Implicit Association Test. The test measures racial prejudices that we cannot consciously control. I've taken it three times now. This time around my uncontrolled prejudice, while clearly present, has come in significantly below the average for white people like me.
You think of yourself as a person who strives to be unprejudiced, but you can't control these split-second reactions.
That certainly beats the first time I took the IAT online, on the website UnderstandingPrejudice.org. That time, my results showed a ""strong automatic preference"" for European Americans over African Americans. That was not a good thing to hear, but it's extremely common51 percent of online test takers show moderate to strong bias.
Taking the IAT, one of the most popular tools among researchers trying to understand racism and prejudice, is both extremely simple and pretty traumatic. The test asks you to rapidly categorize images of faces as either ""African American"" or ""European American"" while you also categorize words (like ""evil,"" ""happy,"" ""awful,"" and ""peace"") as either ""good"" or ""bad."" Faces and words flash on the screen, and you tap a key, as fast as you can, to indicate which category is appropriate.
Sometimes you're asked to sort African American faces and ""good"" words to one side of the screen. Other times, black faces are to be sorted with ""bad"" words. As words and faces keep flashing by, you struggle not to make too many sorting mistakes.
And then suddenly, you have a horrible realization. When black faces and ""bad"" words are paired together, you feel yourself becoming faster in your categorizingan indication that the two are more easily linked in your mind. ""It's like you're on a bike going downhill,"" Amodio says, ""and you feel yourself going faster. So you can say, 'I know this is not how I want to come off,' but there's no other response option.""
You think of yourself as a person who strives to be unprejudiced, but you can't control these split-second reactions. As the milliseconds are being tallied up, you know the tale they'll tell: When negative words and black faces are paired together, you're a better, faster categorizer. Which suggests that racially biased messages from the culture around you have shaped the very wiring of your brain.
Advertise on MotherJones.comI went to NYU to learn what psychologists could tell me about racial prejudice in the wake of the shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, in Ferguson, Missouri. We may never really know the exact sequence of events and assumptions that led to the moment when Brown, unarmed and, according to witnesses, with his hands in the air, was shot multiple times. But the incident is the latest embodiment of America's racial paradox: On the one hand, overt expressions of prejudice have grown markedly less common than they were in the Archie Bunker era. We elected, and reelected, a black president. In many parts of the country, hardly anyone bats an eye at interracial relationships. Most people do not consider racial hostility acceptable. That's why it was so shocking when Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was caught telling his girlfriend not to bring black people to gamesand why those comments led the NBA to ban Sterling for life. And yet, the killings of Michael Brown, Jordan Davis, Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, and so many others remind us that we are far from a prejudice-free society.
An impressive body of psychological research suggests that the men who killed Brown and Martin need not have been conscious, overt racists to do what they did.
Science offers an explanation for this paradoxalbeit a very uncomfortable one. An impressive body of psychological research suggests that the men who killed Brown and Martin need not have been conscious, overt racists to do what they did (though they may have been). The same goes for the crowds that flock to support the shooter each time these tragedies become public, or the birthers whose racially tinged conspiracy theories paint President Obama as a usurper. These people who voice mind-boggling opinions while swearing they're not racist at allthey make sense to science, because the paradigm for understanding prejudice has evolved. There ""doesn't need to be intent, doesn't need to be desire; there could even be desire in the opposite direction,"" explains University of Virginia psychologist Brian Nosek, a prominent IAT researcher. ""But biased results can still occur.""
The IAT is the most famous demonstration of this reality, but it's just one of many similar tools. Through them, psychologists have chased prejudice back to its lairthe human brain.
We're not born with racial prejudices. We may never even have been ""taught"" them. Rather, explains Nosek, prejudice draws on ""many of the same tools that help our minds figure out what's good and what's bad."" In evolutionary terms, it's efficient to quickly classify a grizzly bear as ""dangerous."" The trouble comes when the brain uses similar processes to form negative views about groups of people.
But here's the good news: Research suggests that once we understand the psychological pathways that lead to prejudice, we just might be able to train our brains to go in the opposite direction.
	
Dog, cat. Hot, cold. Black, white. Male, female. We constantly categorize. We have to. Sorting anything from furniture to animals to concepts into different filing folders inside our brains is something that happens automatically, and it helps us function. In fact, categorization has an evolutionary purpose: Assuming that all mushrooms are poisonous, that all lions want to eat you, is a very effective way of coping with your surroundings. Forget being nuanced about nonpoisonous mushrooms and occasionally nonhungry lionscertitude keeps you safe.

But a particular way of categorizing can be inaccurate, and those false categories can lead to prejudice and stereotyping. Much psychological research into bias has focused on how people ""essentialize"" certain categories, which boils down to assuming that these categories have an underlying nature that is tied to inherent and immutable qualities. Like the broader sorting mechanism of categorization, an essentialist cognitive ""style"" emerges very early in our development and may to some extent be hardwired. Psychologist Susan Gelman of the University of Michigan explains it this way: The category of ""things that are white"" is not essentialized. It simply contains anything that happens to share the attribute of ""white"": cars, paint, paper, and so on. There's nothing deep that unites the members of this category.
But now consider white and black people. Like other human attributes (gender, age, and sexual orientation, for example), race tends to be stronglyand inaccuratelyessentialized. This means that when you think of people in that category, you rapidly or even automatically come up with assumptions about their characteristicscharacteristics that your brain perceives as unchanging and often rooted in biology. Common stereotypes with the category ""African Americans,"" for example, include ""loud,"" ""good dancers,"" and ""good at sports."" (One recent study found that white people also tend to essentialize African Americans as magicaltest subjects associated black faces with words like ""paranormal"" and ""spirit."") Of course, these assumptions are false. Indeed, essentialism about any group of people is dubiouswomen are not innately gentle, old people are not inherently feeblemindedand when it comes to race, the idea of deep and fundamental differences has been roundly debunked by scientists.
Even people who know that essentializing race is wrong can't help absorbing the stereotypes that are pervasive in our culture. But essentialist thinking varies greatly between individuals. It's kind of like neurosis: We all have a little bit, but in some people, it's much more pronounced. In national polls, for example, fewer and fewer Americans admit openly to holding racist views. But when told to rate various groups with questions like, ""Do people in these groups tend to be unintelligent or tend to be intelligent?"" more than half of those asked exhibited strong bias against African Americans. Even the labels we use seem to affect our level of prejudice: Another study found that test subjects associated the term ""black"" with more negative attributessuch as low socioeconomic statusthan ""African American.""

One of the earliest and most insightful researchers on these varying rates of bias was Else Frenkel-Brunswik, part of a pioneering generation of post-World War II psychologists who sought to understand why some people seem to find prejudiced and fascist ideas so appealing. Born in 1908 to a Jewish family in what is now Ukraine, Frenkel-Brunswik might never have managed to do her research at all had she not twice escaped the forces of prejudice herself. When she was young, a 1914 pogrom forced her family to flee to Vienna. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, she sought refuge in the United States.
Frenkel-Brunswik's work came long before the days of high-tech tools like eye trackers and computer games that measure bias based on millisecond differences between reactions. Instead she used something far simpler: cards.
She studied young children, some of whom she had previously documented to be highly prejudiced and ethnocentric. In one of many experiments, Frenkel-Brunswik showed the children a sequence of cards similar to the ones on this page. On the first card, the animal is clearly and distinctly a cat. On the last card, it is just as clearly and distinctly a dog. But in between, the cat slowly transforms into the dog.
At each of the stages, the children were asked to identify the animal on the card. Among the more prejudiced children, Frenkel-Brunswik noted something striking: As the image became increasingly ambiguous, ""there was a greater reluctance to give up the original object about which one had felt relatively certaina tendency not to see what did not harmonize with the first set as well as a shying away from transitional solutions."" In other words, for these children, it was much harder to let go of the idea that a cat was a cat.
What Frenkel-Brunswik realized back in 1949, modern research reaffirms. The Implicit Association Test, after all, boils down to how your mind automatically links certain categories. ""It's really how strongly you associate your category of 'black people' with the general category of 'good things' or 'bad things,'"" David Amodio told me. ""The capacity to discern 'us' from 'them' is fundamental in the human brain,"" he wrote in a 2014 paper. ""Although this computation takes just a fraction of a second, it sets the stage for social categorization, stereotypes, prejudices, intergroup conflict and inequality, and, at the extremes, war and genocide."" Call it the banality of prejudice.
	
The process of categorizing the world obviously includes identifying the group or groups to which you belong. And that's where the next psychological factor underpinning prejudice emerges. Much research has found that humans are tribal creatures, showing strong bias against those we perceive as different from us and favoritism toward those we perceive as similar.
In fact, we humans will divide ourselves into in-groups and out-groups even when the perceived differences between the specific groups are completely arbitrary. In one classic study, subjects are asked to rate how much they like a large series of paintings, some of which are described as belonging to the ""Red"" artistic school and others to the ""Green"" school. Then participants are sorted into two groups, red or greennot based on their favoring one school of painting, as they are made to think, but actually at random. In subsequent tasks, people consistently show favoritism toward the arbitrary color group to which they are assigned. When asked to allocate money to other participants, the majority of ""reds"" more generously fund other redsdespite the fact that they have never actually met them. The same goes for ""greens.""

The upshot of such ""minimal group"" experiments is that if you give people the slightest push toward behaving tribally, they happily comply. So if race is the basis on which tribes are identified, expect serious problems.
As these experiments suggest, it is not that we are either prejudiced or unprejudiced, period. Rather, we are more and less prejudiced, based on our upbringings and experiences but also on a variety of temporary or situational prompts (like being told we're on the green team).
One simple, evolutionary explanation for our innate tendency toward tribalism is safety in numbers. You're more likely to survive an attack from a marauding tribe if you join forces with your buddies. And primal fear of those not in the in-group also seems closely tied to racial bias. Amodio's research suggests that one key area associated with prejudice is the amygdala, a small and evolutionarily ancient region in the middle of the brain that is responsible for triggering the notorious ""fight or flight"" response. In interracial situations, Amodio explains, amygdala firing can translate into anything from ""less direct eye gaze and more social distance"" to literal fear and vigilance toward those of other races.
	
We've seen how a variety of cognitive behaviors feed into prejudice. But you know what will really blow your mind? The way that prejudice (or rather, the cognitive styles that underlie it) can interfere with how our brains functionoften for the worse.
Racism has another, lesser-known effect: It can make us less innovative.
Consider, for instance, research by Carmit Tadmor, a psychologist at the Recanati School of Business at Tel Aviv University. In one 2013 paper, Tadmor and her colleagues showed that racial prejudice can play a direct and causal role in making people less creative. We're not talking about artistic creativity here, but more like seeing beyond the constraints of traditional categories""thinking outside the box.""
Tadmor's team first uncovered a simple positive correlation between one's inclination to endorse an essentialist view of race (like associating racial differences with abilities and personality traits) and one's creativity. To measure the latter, the researchers used a simple open-ended test in which individuals are asked to list as many possible uses of a brick as they can think of. People who can think outside of traditional categoriesrealizing that a brick can be used for many things other than buildings (it can make a good paperweight, for starters)score better. This study showed that people who essentialized racial categories tended to have fewer innovative ideas about a brick.
But that was just the beginning. Next, a new set of research subjects read essays that described race either as a fundamental difference between people (an essentialist position) or as a construct, not reflecting anything more than skin-deep differences (a nonessentialist position). After reading the essays, the subjects moved on to a difficult creativity test that requires you to identify the one key word that unites three seemingly unassociated words. Thus, for instance, if you are given the words ""call,"" ""pay,"" and ""line,"" the correct answer is ""phone.""
Remarkably, subjects who'd read the nonessentialist essay about race fared considerably better on the creativity test. Their mean score was a full pointor 32 percenthigher than it was for those who read the essentialist essay.
It's not like the people in this study were selected because of their preexisting racial prejudices. They weren't. Instead, merely a temporary exposure to essentialist thinking seemed to hamper their cognitive flexibility. ""Essentialism appears to exert its negative effects on creativity not through what people think but how they think,"" conclude Tadmor and her colleagues. That's because, they add, ""stereotyping and creative stagnation are rooted in a similar tendency to overrely on existing category attributes."" Those quick-judgment skills that allowed us to survive on the savanna? Not always helpful in modern life.
So, yes: Prejudice and essentialism are bad for your brainif you value creative thinking, anyway. But they can also be downright dangerous.
At NYU, David Amodio sat me down to take another test called the Weapons Identification Task. I had no idea what I was in for.
In this test, like on the IAT, you have two buttons that you can push. Images flash rapidly on the screen, and your task is to push the left shift key if you see a tool (a wrench, or a power drill, say) and the right shift key if you see a gun. You have to go super fastif you don't respond within half a second, the screen blares at you, in giant red letters, ""TOO SLOW.""
""It does that to keep you from thinking too much,"" Amodio would later explain.
But it's not just guns and tools flashing on the screen: Before each object you see a face, either white or black. The faces appear for a split second, the objects for a split second, and then you have to press a key. If you are faster and more accurate at identifying guns after you see a black face than after you see a white face, that would suggest your brain associates guns (and threat) more with the former. You might also be more inclined to wrongly think you see a gun, when it's actually just a tool, right after seeing a black face. (The weapons task was created by psychologist Keith Payne of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in response to the tragic 1999 death of Amadou Diallo, a Guinean immigrant shot by New York City police after the officers mistook the wallet in his hand for a weapon.)
I'm sorry to ruin the suspense: I don't know what my score was on the Weapons Identification Task. The test ruffled me so much that I messed up badly. It is stressful to have to answer quickly to avoid being rebuked by the game. And it's even more upsetting to realize that you've just ""seen"" a gun that wasn't actually there, right after a black face flashed.
This happened to me several times, and then I suddenly found myself getting ""TOO SLOW"" messages whenever the object to be identified was a gun. This went on for many minutes and numerous trials. For a while, I thought the test was broken. But it wasn't: I finally realized that rather than pressing the right shift key, I had somehow started pressing the enter key whenever I thought I saw a gun. It's almost like I'd subconsciously decided to stop making ""gun"" choices at all. (Psychoanalyze that.)
But don't take that as a cop-out: Before I (arguably) tried to dodge responsibility by pressing the wrong key, I clearly showed implicit bias. And it was horrifying.
	
The upshot of all of this research is that in order to rid the world of prejudice, we can't simply snuff out overt, conscious, full-throated racism. Nor can we fundamentally remake the human brain, with its rapid-fire associations and its categorizing, essentializing, and groupish tendencies. Instead, the key lies in shifting people's behavior, even as we also make them aware of how cultural assumptions merge with natural cognitive processes to create biases they may not know they have.
And that just might be possible. Take the Implicit Association Test: In a massive study, Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia and his colleagues tested 17 different proposed ways of reducing people's unconscious bias on the IAT. Many of these experimental interventions failed. But some succeeded, and there was an interesting pattern to those that did.
The single best intervention involved putting people into scenarios and mindsets in which a black person became their ally (or even saved their life) while white people were depicted as the bad guys. In this intervention, participants ""read an evocative story told in second-person narrative in which a White man assaults the participant and a Black man rescues the participant."" In other words, study subjects are induced to feel as if they have been personally helped or even saved by someone from a different race. Then they took the IATand showed 48 percent less bias than a control group. (Note: The groups in these various studies were roughly three-fourths white; no participants were black.)

Other variations on this idea were successful too: making nonblack people think about black role models, or imagine themselves playing on a dodgeball team with black teammates against a team of white people (who proceed to cheat). In other words, it appears that our tribal instincts can actually be co-opted to decrease prejudice, if we are made to see those of other races as part of our team.
When it comes to weakening racial essentialism, Carmit Tadmor and her colleagues undertook a variety of experiments to try to produce what they called ""epistemic unfreezing."" Subjects were exposed to one of three 20-minute multimedia presentations: one exclusively about American culture, one exclusively about Chinese culture, and one comparing American and Chinese cultures (with different aspects of each culture, such as architecture or food, presented back to back). Only in the last scenario were subjects pushed to compare and contrast the two cultures, presumably leading to a more nuanced perspective on their similarities and differences.
This experimental manipulation has been found to increase creativity. But surprisingly, it also had a big effect on reducing anti-black prejudice. In one study, Tadmor et al. found that white research subjects who had heard the multicultural presentation (but not the American-only or Chinese-only presentation) were less likely than members of the other study groups to endorse stereotypes about African Americans. That was true even though the subjects had learned about Chinese and American cultures, not African American culture.
In a variation, the same 20-minute lecture also produced fewer discriminatory hiring decisions. After hearing one of the three kinds of lectures, white study subjects were shown a series of rsums for the position of ""Sales Manager"" at a company. The rsums were varied so that some applicants had white-sounding names, and some had black-sounding names. It's a research paradigm that has often been shown to produce discriminatory effects, which presumably occur through the manifestation of uncontrolled or implicit prejudicesbut this time around, there was a glimmer of hope in the findings.
White subjects who had heard the lecture exclusively about American culture (with topics like Disney, Coca-Cola, and the White House) picked a white candidate over an equally qualified black candidate 81 percent of the time. Subjects who had heard a lecture exclusively about Chinese culture picked a white candidate a full 86 percent of the time. But subjects who had heard the culture-comparing lecture selected the white candidate only 56 percent of the time.
These studies clearly suggest that, at least for the relatively short time span of a psychology experiment, there are cognitive ways to make people less prejudiced. That's not the same asnor can it be a substitute forbroader cultural or institutional change. After all, there is ample evidence that culture feeds directly into the mind's process of generating prejudices and adopting stereotypical beliefs.
Nonetheless, if prejudice has both a psychological side and a cultural side, we must address both of these aspects. A good start may simply be making people aware of just how unconsciously biased they can be. That's particularly critical in law enforcement, where implicit biases can lead to tragic outcomes.
In fact, this phenomenon has been directly studied in the lab, particularly through first-person shooter tests, where subjects must rapidly decide whether to shoot individuals holding either guns or harmless objects like wallets and soda cans. Research suggests that police officers (those studied were mostly white) are much more accurate at the general task (not shooting unarmed people) than civilians, thanks to their training. But like civilians, police are considerably slower to press the ""don't shoot"" button for an unarmed black man than they are for an unarmed white manand faster to shoot an armed black man than an armed white man. (Women weren't includedthe extra variable of gender would have complicated the results.)
Such research has led to initiatives like the Fair and Impartial Policing program, which has trained officers across the United States on how implicit biases work and how to control them. Few officers look forward to these trainings, says program founder Lorie Fridell, a criminologist; they don't consider themselves to be racist. ""Police are very defensive about this issue,"" she says. ""That's because we have been dealing with this issue using outdated science. We treat them as if they have an explicit bias. They are offended by that.""
So instead, Fridell's team focuses first on showing the officers the subtle ways in which implicit bias might influence their actions. For example: The trainers present a role-play where there are three people: a female victim of domestic violence, and a male and female comforting her. When the officers are asked to address the situation, says Fridell, most assume that the man is the perp. Then, the trainers reveal that it was actually the womanand the officers learn that they do, in fact, act on bias. It's not because they are bad people; in fact, in their work, they may have experiences that reinforce stereotypes. Which is why it's important that police officerswho see the worst in people in their everyday dutiesteach themselves not to assume the worst.
""You're an officer, you're pumping adrenaline, you don't have time to evaluate whether your implicit bias is driving your behavior.""
The program, which receives support from the US Department of Justice, has trained officers in more than 250 precincts and agencies, but it's hard to measure its successthere is no baseline comparison, since prejudiced policing isn't always rigorously documented. But the feedback is encouraging. ""I have a new awareness of bias-based policing within my own agency,"" one participant wrote in an evaluation. ""The presentation of scientific data provided me with a more convincing argument that supported the existence of unintentional, but widespread racial bias, which I was typically quick to dismiss.""
Staff members at the University of California-Los Angeles-based Center for Policing Equity use implicit-bias research in a different way: They take unconscious prejudice as a givenand try to make changes within communities to ensure that it does as little damage as possible. A few years ago, Las Vegas was seeking to address police officers' use of force, especially against people of color. Most of the incidents occurred after pursuits of suspects on foot, the majority of which happened in nonwhite neighborhoods. Center president Phillip Atiba Goff explains that he knew how difficult it would be to change the pursuing officers' thinking. ""You're an officer, you're pumping adrenaline, you don't have time to evaluate whether your implicit bias is driving your behavior,"" he says. So instead, the center worked with the department to make a small but meaningful tweak to the rules: In foot chases, the pursuing officer would no longer be allowed to touch the person being chased; if use of force was necessary, a partner who wasn't involved in the pursuit would step in. ""We recognized implicit bias, and we took it out of the equation,"" Goff says. ""We decoupled the prejudice from the behavior."" Sure enough, use of force in foot chasesand, as a result, overall use of force against people of colordeclined significantly shortly after the policy went into effect.
	
Unsettling though it is, the latest research on our brains could actually have some very positive outcomesif we use it in the right way. The link between essentialism and creativity doesn't just tell us how we might reduce prejudice. It could also help us to become a more innovative countryby prioritizing diversity, and the cognitive complexity and boost in creativity it entails. The research on rapid-fire, implicit biases, meanwhile, should restart a debate over the role of mediathe news segment that depicts immigrants as hostile job snatchers, the misogynistic lyrics in a songin subtly imparting stereotypes that literally affect brain wiring. Indeed, you could argue that not only does the culture in which we live make us subtly prejudiced, but it does so against our will. That's a disturbing thought.
Especially when you consider how biases affect government policy. Consider this: In October 2012, researchers from the University of Southern California sent emails asking legislators in districts with large Latino populations what documentation was needed in order to vote. Half the emails came from people with Anglo-sounding names; the other half, Latino-sounding names. Republican politicians who had sponsored voter ID laws responded to 27 percent of emails from ""Latino"" constituents and 67 percent of emails from ""white"" constituents. For Republicans who'd voted against voter ID laws, the gap was far less dramaticthe response figures were 38 percent for Latino names and 54 percent for white names.
You can imagine how this kind of thing might create a vicious cycle: When biased legislators make it harder for certain communities to vote, they are also less likely to serve alongside lawmakers from those communitiesthus making it less likely for a coalitional experience to change their biases.
So how do we break the cycle? We could require lawmakers to engage in exercises to recognize their own unconscious prejudice, like the Fair and Impartial Policing program does. Or we could even go a step further and anonymize emails they receive from constituentsthus taking implicit bias out of the equation.
Short of that, you can do something very simple to fight prejudice: Trick your brain. UNC-Chapel Hill's Payne suggests that by deliberately thinking a thought that is directly counter to widespread stereotypes, you can break normal patterns of association. What counts as counterstereotypical? Well, Payne's study found that when research subjects were instructed to think the word ""safe"" whenever they saw a black faceundermining the stereotypical association between black people and dangerthey were 10 percent less likely than those in a control group to misidentify a gun in the Weapons Identification Task.
To be sure, it will take more than thought exercises to erase the deep tracks of prejudice America has carved through the generations. But consciousness and awareness are a startand the psychological research is nothing if not a consciousness-raiser. Taking the IAT made me realize that we can't just draw some arbitrary line between prejudiced people and unprejudiced people, and declare ourselves to be on the side of the angels. Biases have slipped into all of our brains. And that means we all have a responsibility to recognize those biasesand work to change them.

The Nation,L,An Open Letter To Charles Barkley | The Nation,"

Charles Barkley, former NBA player and current studio analyst, on horseback (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)


Dear Charles,
Let me say first that you are among the basketball greats. I remember rooting for you in the 93 Championship Series against the Bulls along with one of my hometown heroes Richard Dumas. You have achieved a level of success on the court that will be cemented in the basketball history books permanently. Eleven NBA All-Star Game appearances, twice All-Star MVP, once voted NBA MVP, one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. Dream Team, two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. You are basketball royalty.
Your book Whos Afraid of a Large Black Man? is sitting on my bookshelf right now. Its a powerful book that takes on the issue of race and racism in a way that many wouldve shied away from.
Racism, you said, is the biggest cancer of my lifetime. And I know I cant cure the cancer, but doesnt somebody have to attack it?
In Whos Afraid of a Large Black Man? you compiled a very impressive list of fascinating opinions and personal stories from then-Senator Obama, Michael Wilbon, Tiger Woods, Morgan Freeman and many other famous personalities on their ideas about race and other issues in America. Your words were to the point, with little of your trademark humor. Its clear that the audience you most hoped to reach with this book were young black men and women, and I commend you for using your celebrity status and influence to positively effect black youth.
You have never been afraid to speak your mind and I commend you for that. But with that comes great responsibility.
During an interview on 97.5 The Fanatic in Philadelphia, the day after the Ferguson decision was announced, host Mike Missanelli asked you to express your thoughts about it and why black America didnt trust the ruling. Your response was quite surprising to me. You said: The true story came out from the grand jury testimony. You explained that you were made aware of key forensic evidence, and several black witnesses that supported Officer Darren Wilsons story
You went on to say:
[W]e have to be really careful with the cops, because if it wasnt for the cops we would be living in the Wild, Wild West in our neighborhoodswe cant pick out certain incidentals that dont go our way and act like the cops are all bad. Do you know how bad some of these neighborhoods would be if it wasnt for the cops?

You continued to refer to the Ferguson looters as scumbags, and further praised police officers who work in black neighborhoods, and reiterated that you support the decision made by the grand jury not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the Michael Brown shooting.
Mainstream America was falling over themselves with joy at your statements. They couldnt be happier.
The headline from Young Conservatives read, Charles Barkley Speaks The Truth about Ferguson, Calls Out Media, And Its Epic.
The Tea Party Network wrote, Former NBA star Charles Barkley slams Ferguson rioters, left stream media and Obama.
When the wolf begins to praise the sheep, it would be wise for the sheep to undergo some serious self-evaluation.
The fact that they were praising you should have made you take a long look in the mirror. Im not going to disrespect you by calling you an Uncle Tom or putting up a big picture of Samuel L Jackson from Django Unchained, nor am I writing this to slam you, although I am sure many writers will attempt to frame it this way. I respectfully disagree with a position that you have every right to take.
The reason why your latest comments were so surprising for many in the black community is because they appeared to echo Bill O Reilly, Sean Hannity and the rest of Fox News. Thats not what we expect from Sir Charles.
Its like in Animal Farm where the other animals looked in the window and the pigs were walking upright like the evil humans.
Sir Charles should never appear to be taking on the characteristics of Rush Limbaugh.
This wasnt the first time either. I did a double take after your statements after the Trayvon Martin verdict. I actually thought I was reading one of those satire articles when you told host Maria Bartiromo on CNBCs Closing Bell: Thats probably not a popular opinion among most people. But just looking at the evidence, I agreed with the verdict.
You went on to say, I dont think that guy [George Zimmerman] should have gone to jail for the rest of his life. Because something happened bad that night.
As a result you will be praised by many who search for a black face to reference who is in agreement with their regularly pushed agendas. Its the Rudolph Guliani and cops are always right and the black community is always deserving to be treated as criminals doctrine.
Theyre going to invite you to speak on all of their shows and attend their events. Youll be awarded admission into their extra exclusive golf club memberships. They may even ask you to publicly endorse Ben Carson. Youll be the voice of black America on their shows. Its like the Don Lemon fast-track to stardom playbook.
Youll get more commercials, movie roles hell, we may see you running through the airport jumping over suitcases or starring in the modernized Naked Gun movie with Tucker Carlson as Leslie Neilson. (Just be careful, because all that love and admiration could dissipate in a flash.)
How much confidence can you have in a decision to not indict Darren Wilson when the leading prosecuting attorney was Robert McCulloch, who has never in his entire twenty-three-year career indicted a police officer for killing someone in the line of duty? This was the fifth grand jury McCulloch presented evidence to in a police shooting, and still not a single indictment. And there are other reasons to question this outcome. This PBS Newshour chart shows that sixteen of eighteen grand jury witnesses testified that Michael Brown had his hands up when he was fatally shot.

As far as the police are concerned, we all (black, white, Hispanic, Asian, all communities) want the same thing: we want good, honest, committed police officers who are actually serving and protecting everyone. Were not indicting all police officers, but we do want criminal police officers removed. To view the police completely as good is just as dangerous as viewing them completely as evil. Both are very far from accurate.
But there is a reason people are hostile. There have been fourteen black teens killed by police since Mike Brown. Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice killed in Cleveland, 14-year-old Cameron Tillman in Louisiana, VonDerrit Myers Jr. not far from where Mike Brown was killed, 18-year-old Jeffrey Holden in Kansas City.
In addition, a never-ending reel of police brutality and beatings is constantly shown on social media. And, in most cases, fails to result in any type of punishment for the cop. They typically are put on paid administrative leave (as was Darren Wilson for over 100 days), which is in essence a paid vacation, and yet you have the nerve to praise the police as a whole for their work in the black community ?
And while we dont condone breaking the law, burning or looting, let me remind you of a quote from Dr. King, who said, A riot is the voice of the unheard.
You have to take into account the everyday living and existing in a state of inequality that has led to the riots. The outrage and disgust of feeling helpless. A community who sees no justice. Youre focused on the reaction and not the cause of the reaction.
Dr. King also said, Our greatest stumbling block toward freedom is not the Ku Klux Klan, its the white moderate who are more devoted to order than to justice.
Why do you think President Obama asked for $263 million to provide police departments with body cameras? Because sometimes the scumbags are in fact the ones with the badge and the ones deserving praise are the ones in the black communities who survive them.
So, as a federal investigation by the Justice Department into the shooting death of Michael Brown continues, in addition to an investigation into allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns and practices by the Ferguson Police Department; and with the inconsistent officer testimony to the grand jury and the continuing mistrust between the black community and the police in mind, you can understand why your statements disappointed, angered, sickened and disgusted many in the black community. Because it felt like betrayal.
You werent afraid to ask that all-important question, a question that confronts people who look like Michael Brown, Eric Garner and myself: Whos afraid a large black man? Tragically, it now seems like the answer might be you.
Sincerely,
Etan Thomas

The Nation,L,"Our Public Education System Needs Transformation, Not Reform | The Nation","

(AP Photo/ Jose F. Moreno)


Charter-school advocates and others who claim the mantle of education reform have now seen their ideas put into practice in a number of areasfrom high-stakes testing to digital learning to the takeover of struggling public schools. The results are in. How are they doing? Suffice it to say, if this were a high-stakes test, theyd fail.
As the articles in this issue illustrate, the strategies pursued by education reformers frequently dovetail with those of austerity hawks. The latter burnish their conservative credentials by cutting budgets and defunding schools. The reformers sweep in to capitalize on the situation, introducing charter chains like Rocketship and K12, which produce real no benefits for students. The chains do, however, generate cash for investors, as a new trove of public money is directed to private coffers. Far too many poor kids, meanwhile, are consigned to schools like Philadelphias Bartram High: buffeted by violence, wracked by relentless budget cuts and choked by the white noose of wealthy suburbs (in the evocative phrase of former Mayor Richardson Dilworth) that soak up a disproportionate share of resources.
Of course, US schools were not perfect before the advent of market-oriented reform. Charter schools were praised by American Federation of Teachers president Al Shanker in 1988not as replacements for public schools but as laboratories where new pedagogical ideas could be developed. While fighting to keep public education public, we shouldnt lose sight of the importance of efforts to experiment with teaching, and to see what new technologies can do if introduced in the interest of children instead of private investors.

The havoc wreaked by so-called education reform has had the upside of crystallizing a movement of parents, teachers, school staffers and kids who are fighting for education justice. Schools, as Pedro Noguera points out in this issue, are still a vital social safety net for children. A truly progressive vision for public education shouldnt focus on stories of how a few kids competed their way out of blighted neighborhoods. Instead, it should focus on taking back that stream of money going to charter chains and corporate tax cuts and redirecting it toward schools anchored in strong communities and using proven methods for teaching kidsthe very methods deployed in schools where the rich send their children. Indeed, the most disadvantaged kids should get even more support for their schools than their privileged suburban counterparts.
Without education equity, we dont have an educational system at allwe have a rigged rat race that starts in kindergarten.

The Nation,L,Plugged Into the Socket of Life | The Nation,"

Lily Tomlin and Richard Pryor in 1974.For Scott Sauls multimedia archive of Richard Pryors life, go towww.becomingrichardpryor.com


This essay is adapted from Becoming Richard Pryor, to be published on December 9, 2014, by Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. Copyright  2014 by Scott Saul.
My grandmother is the lady who used to discipline me, says a slender man in his late 30s, wearing a collarless red satin shirt, black slacks and gold shoes. You know, beat my ass, he adds with a chuckle. His face flickers between the confident look of a storyteller in control of his audience and the haunted look of a child who recalls how he was beaten more than why. It is December 1978, and before him, at Long Beachs Terrace Theater, sits a crowd of 3,000. Theyre watching what will become, after the film is released, the most celebrated stand-up-comedy performance of all time: Richard Pryor: Live in Concert.
Anyone here remember them switches? the comedian asks his audience. You used to have to go get off the tree yourself and take them leaves like that? A roar of Yeah! comes back at him. He demonstrates by reaching upward and groping to strip off a branch, suddenly a little boy agonizing over the task before him. For the rest of the sketch, hell flip effortlessly, with a jazzy rhythm, between boy and man. I see them trees today, I will kill one of them motherfuckers, he says. I will stop the carsay, Wait, hold it! He strides over to the microphone stand and starts throttling it with a rage thats absurdarbicidal. You aint never gonna grow up! You wont be beating nobodys ass!
Then he pauses, returning to the perversity of his past and finding some belated pleasure in it: Thats some hell of a psychologyto make you go get a switch to beat your own ass with, right? My grandmother said, Boy, go get me somethin to beat your ass with. And that would be the longest walk in the world. He pivots so that the crowd can see him in profile, a boy inching forward with a frozen look of fear on his face. You be thinking all kind of shit, cause you know you done fucked up, Jack. The boy turns his eyes upward as if in prayer and whimpers: Maybe itll snow before I get there. Maybe shell have a heart attack and wont be able to whup me. I dont want to get no whuppin, cause its going to tear it up.
You get them switches and they start cutting the wind on the way home, the adult comic explains. Make you start crying before you get in the house.
Shwoo-shwoo.
Ma-ma! The boys whimper has opened into a full-on wail.
Shwoo-shwoo.
Ma-ma! I dont want Mama, please! Mama, please! The boy starts darting from one place to another, cowering while dodging blows that seem to rain over his entire body. Mamapleasemamapleasemamaplease! he howls, his voice the same pitch as a babys scream.
At this point, the routine takes the less expected tack. It would be easy for the comic, looking back at the beatings that framed his childhood, to paint his grandmother as the villain of this tale. He does not. When he plays her, his voice assumes a honeyed drawl, a more confident register, as if he were relishing her strength.
Get your ass out! his grandmother hollers when the boy tries to escape her wrath by putting himself to bed early. Put your hand up! Dont you run from me! Dont you run from me! Then, giving one downward clout to her grandsons body with every syllable: Long as you black, dont you run from me!
The crowd roars at this last lineat the wallop of it, the double truth about the boys life that it relays. Try as he might, theres no outrunning the twin forces of his fate: the squeeze of his race, and the squeeze of his grandmothers discipline.
The next morning, the boy faces the woman who struck him and is given a lesson in the peculiarity of love. Morning, Mama, he says softly, his mouth fixed in a grimace from the welt that has taken over his face. Come here, baby, she says, then looks at his bruises tenderly, fixing them up. You see, you shouldnt do that, goddamn it. I told you not tojust sit still now. Shes still administering to the bruises when Richard Pryor delivers the last line of the sketch in her voice: And next time you do it, Im going to tear your ass up again.
The comedian laughs, waits for the applause to die down, moves on. The instabilities of his childhoodthe confusions of love and violencehave shaped him into the kind of person who is never at home with peace. A tangle of competing impulses, he cycles not just through moods but through whole personalities, with the ingenuous child and the avenging adult figuring among the most prominent. Offstage, these personalities flow through him with a volatility that makes him hard to handle, if not bewildering. One of his many wives, a few months into their short-lived marriage, says that getting to know him is like getting to know twenty-five or thirty different people. Onstage, he is mesmerizing. You feel, in the audience, that youre plugged into the socket of lifethat youre seeing not a single man but rather an entire world in roiling motion, animated through a taut experiment in creative chaos and artistic control.
For the comedian, though, the stakes are more personal. Ever since he started to find his voice as a comic in the mid-1960s, the stage has been the place where he can set his contradictions in motion and try to play the full array of his many selves. If hes having a good nightif the comedy gods smile upon him, if he finds his formRichard Pryor can own all these personalities as much as they own him.
* * *
When invited to work with new collaborators in the early 1970s, Richard Pryor devised little experiments to see how his world would collide with theirs. With filmmakers like Mel Brooks, James B. Harris and Mel Stuart, he would remove some cocaine from, say, a tinfoil package as casually as one might unwrap a chocolate bar, snort a little himself, then offer the astonished onlookers a toot. (One did not need to take it to pass his testjust to refrain from judgment.) With the actress Lily Tomlin, who hoped that Richard might lend his talents as an actor to her first TV special, the tests were more elaborate. I had to jump through hoops for him, Lily recalled. Im sure he was testing if this white girl was OK to work with.
Richard began with the neighborhood test: he took Lily to a black part of Los Angeles to observe how she behaved and was received. Lily had grown up in a working-class ghetto in Detroit, where success meant, if you were a girl, not getting pregnant; if you were a boy, not going to jail. On the streets of black LA, she was at easeand greeted with cheers of enthusiasm. People recognized her from Laugh-In, the sketch-comedy show for which she had developed unforgettable characters like Edith Ann, the most audacious of 5-year-old girls, or Ernestine, the telephone operator, pinch-faced and punchy, snorting in self-amusement.
Satisfied with the results of Lilys first test, Richard asked the loose-limbed actress to accompany him to a porn theater. He had probed her for any racial hang-ups; her sexual hang-ups were next. A committed feminist, Lily agreed to go, but only if she could pay her own way. So Richard escorted her, on this odd Dutch date, to the Pussycat theater on Santa Monica Boulevard. Nearby, a sign winked Nude Live Girls.
However Lily comported herself at the Pussycat, it worked. Soon after, Richard invited her to his Hollywood Hills cottage, where they brainstormed her TV special. We had conversations that spiraled into the ozone, Richard recalled. In minutes, wed create enough characters to populate entire neighborhoods. Richard found in Lily a comedian who was wedded, like him, less to the pursuit of laughs than to the pursuit of character, and who was willing to lose herself in the act of imagination. We are soul mates, Richard reflected in 1977. I mean the characters we do literally take possession of us. Youre OK as long as you keep an eye on whats happening, as long as you dont get scared and tighten up. Because then you lose control over yourself and the character takes over completely. Ive never seen it happen to any other entertainers but Lily and me.
The collaboration between these two soul mates was brief, beginning in late 1972 and ending a year later, but it left a considerable imprint on Richards psyche. Working with Lily enlarged his sense of himself: unguarded in her presence, he found new reserves of both fearlessness and tenderness. For the first time, he was working with a performer who was equally committed to the battle for free expressionwho was willing, even, to lead the charge to create something sharp and poetic on prime-time TV. The networks feel certain things dont belong in variety shows, Lily quipped at the time, but what Ive always hated about variety shows is that they have no variety. Together, the two of them produced some of the most remarkable television moments of the 1970s: scenes of interracial affection that didnt aim for movie-of-the-week significance and so, in their roundabout way, were able to achieve something more striking: they avoided the easy laughs and went for the hard ones instead. As the Los Angeles Times observed, Lilys TV work made the 11 oclock news afterward seem like a situation comedy.
* * *
From the start, Lily grasped Richards potential as an actor. She urged her creative partner, Jane Wagner, to write a sketch that could tap into the full array of Richards abilities, something hed be proud of. A white Tennessean by birth, Wagner was nevertheless deft at capturing the flow and hardship of black life. She had earlier written J.T., an unusually bracing TV movie about a black boy who, estranged from his mother and school, devotes himself to nursing a wounded cat back to health. In a shocking departure from the usual formulas, Wagner had the cat get run over by a car. For Lily and Richard, Wagner delivered the ten-minute Juke and Opal, about a woman who runs a hash house and the man who drifts into her establishment looking for some mixture of companionship and drug money. Three decades later, New Yorker theater critic Hilton Als hailed it as the most profound meditation on race and class that I have ever seen on a major network. But when Lily submitted the draft of her specials script to CBS, the script came back with Juke and Opal excised by the producer the network had selected.
For this first special, titled The Lily Tomlin Show, Lily and Richard were left mainly with a more limited sketch, one that put Lilys Tasteful Lady and Richards neighborhood wino together in an elevator for a short and unpredictable ride. The premise was simply to watch these two characters a snob and a derelict with dignityduel in an enclosed space. At rehearsal, the network was horrified at Richards improvised sallies. You ever kiss a black man? his wino (here named Lightning Bug) teased. You better get off of here before you get pregnant. To make matters worse, the staging of the sketch coincided with the premiere of the music documentary Wattstax, for which Richard had styled his hair in cornrows with white leather braiding, and he played up the unfamiliarity of his coif. He was telling people it had been tied up with some white peoples skin, Lily recalled. And it made all these people in suits just blanch. They didnt know what to do.
The sketchs most provocative momentsthe ad libs that invoked the specter of interracial sexwere edited out, but the larger sketch survived, and with it a quick portrait of an unlikely intimacy. I dont believe a thing youre saying, sniffs the Tasteful Lady, to which Lightning Bug responds: I dont, either. The sketch ends on a promising note, the Tasteful Lady softened by Lightning Bugs roguish charm:
Lightning Bug: I may be a wino, but I am a gentleman, believe that. Im going to give you my card and if youre down Philadelphia waya little expressionI want you to look me up. My motto is, You can always share a jug with Lightning Bug.
The Tasteful Lady (saving the card in her purse): Keep in touch, Mr. Lightning Bug.

The courtship is improbable but believable, since these two socially distant characters share a hidden affinity. Like so many of Pryors and Tomlins characters, they are misfits who speak their own truth, and with a beguiling confidence and authority. I always want them to be strong, Lily said. I never like to do anybody whos defeated. The person I love most of all is somebody who conventionally looks out of place, and who thinks shes wonderful. Theres nobody more beautiful than that. She might as well have been speaking of the headstrong characters who populated Richards stage, from his wino to his chippies to the members of his own familycharacters who, through the force of their personality, acted as if no stigma were attached to them. By trapping the Tasteful Lady and Lightning Bug in an elevator together, Lily and Richard dramatized the secret solidarities that can cut across class lines.
The Lily Tomlin Show was a winner in the Nielsen ratings, a solid eleventh for the week, and when CBS asked her to deliver another show in the fall, Lily was determined to leverage her success and gain more artistic freedom on her second special, this time titled Lily. She brought in new writers, such as Off Off Broadway playwright Rosalyn Drexler and future Saturday Night Live producers Lorne Michaels and Herb Sargent. The Juke and Opal sketch, she decided, would not be cut this time; the producer whod deleted it from the first special was not invited back. Plotting her moves strategically, Lily also decided to bring back War Games, an antiwar sketch that network execs had previously quashed, scandalized by the idea of a mother telling her son, who is playing soldier in the backyard: Come onleg or no leg, suppers on the table. Perhaps Lily could use War Games as a bargaining chip if the network tried to block Juke and Opal for a second time.
As on the previous special, Richards improvising spirit put him at loggerheads with CBS. In a new sketch, featuring Lily as Edith Ann and Richard as a young kid, the latter made up the guileless riff: I have titties bigger than your tittiesboys have tittiesfirst, boys have titties then girls. The network reps panicked and put a stop to the scene, and Richard felt so deflated that he left the soundstage. Lily met him in his dressing room and urged him to give it another try, but Richard said, I cant do no more. He told a journalist later: I cant go onstage and it be in my mind that this kid cant say something, cause the kid is wrecked, as a kid. I mean, I was ready to cry as a kid, cause I was the kid, you dig. Thats the way I see kids; I just get fascinated talking to em, cause itll be honestly sweet, and whatever they say is innocent. And if they say tittie, you cant tell a kid you cant say tittie. They deal with real shit. The sketch was scrapped; Lily performed Edith Ann solo instead.
Juke and Opal had no off-color language to which the network could object. It was remarkably restrained as it tracked the arms-length intimacy between Juke, a man struggling to throw off a heroin addiction and get a job, and Opal, who operates her diner with a mix of sensitivity and bottom-dog wit. (Dont hand me that jive about job training, she tells Juke. You trained, all right. You highly skilled at not working.) Still, Juke and Opal was troubling to the network for other reasons. During its taping, Lily was standing on the set, waiting for another take, when she noticed that everyone else had left. I go into the hall, and everyone is standing around in a huddle, she recalled. They had just got the word to stop taping this. We dont want this on the air.
* * *
What had so inflamed the networks executives? A critic later praised Lily as probably the most radical departure from television and comedic conventions we will see on the tube this season, and Juke and Opal was Exhibit A for how wayward the special had become, how much it purposefully ran off the rails. Everybody kept saying it wasnt funny, but we wanted to do little poems, Jane Wagner said.
As a little poem, the sketch doesnt explainmuch less overexplainits two main characters. The nature of Juke and Opals relationship is subtly enigmatic, starting with the question of Opals racial identity: Lily deliberately left Opals race open-ended, disguising her hair behind a scarf and giving her a clipped accent that could be either poor white or poor black. (Some viewers thought Opal was mixed-race or black; others assumed she was white.) The two might be former lovers or prospective lovers. Theyre reaching, albeit gingerly, toward some new intimacy: Juke plays Al Greens Lets Stay Together on Opals jukebox, and after she turns down his invitation to dance, she hangs back behind the counter, looking at him slyly and dancing with herself. Both of them have a generally wounded look to them, but we cant tell whether theyve been wounded by each other or simply the world. The world arrives at Opals diner in the form of two young social workers, a pair of well-meaning types who would never enter her place for the food. Here, they come armed with a community questionnaire. As soon as they arrive, an invisible thread snaps: the dancing comes to a halt, Lets Stay Together fades out. We feel the fragility of what Juke and Opal have, and the value of Opals diner as a haven for irregulars, a warm spot in a cold city.
Opal has a wry working-class knowingness to her. When one of the social workers, defending himself, says about his questionnaire: Try to understandwe dont make up these questions, she quickly counters: Try to understandwe do make up these answers. Yet Opal also looks beyond her world. Her greasy spoon is named, with who knows how much irony, Opals Silver Spoon Cafe. The sketch begins and ends with a similarly free-floating juxtaposition: the hash-slinger Opal watching, on her TV, a Julia Childlike chef instructing viewers on how to prepare a cold lobster sauce and bananas flamb.
As Juke, Pryor was at his best as an actor. He modulated the junkie character hed performed in his stand-up, preserving that characters vulnerability but making him more multifaceted. With the social workers, Juke is acerbic; he steals the questionnaire out of their hands and puts them on the defensive with improvised questions like Whos Pigmeat Markhams mama? With Opal, hes undefended, transparently working through his conflicting needs. He wants both her affection and the heroin he craves, and for most of the sketch, hes willing to leverage the former for the latter, angling to borrow $10 from her so he can get high.
By the end, though, a gear has shifted in Jukes mind; he has started to see himself through Opals watchful and loving eyes. He gives her back the $10 and makes a modest promise: that hell try to stay clean. The end of the sketch is filled with similarly small but meaningful gestures; nothing is italicized for our benefit. Juke leans in and the two kiss briefly, their faces obscured by the camera angle. Then, exiting the diner and heading into a swirl of cold wind outside, Juke leaves her musing on better times to come: Ill think about you. Be glad when its spring, flower.
All told, Juke and Opal was closer to the best stage drama than the usual sketch comedy, and CBS hoped to have none of it. A CBS executive, upon seeing the special, called it a $360,000 jerk-off. Juke and Opal in particular was objectionable in so many ways: it was too long, it wasnt funny, and, to top it off, it smuggled in a kiss between a black man and a white woman. Lily negotiated like Talleyrand to preserve the sketch. She offered to can War Games if she could keep Juke and Opal, and the network agreed to this lesser of two evilsunder the condition that she sweeten the sketch with a laugh track (so that viewers would think it was, indeed, funny) and move it to the end of the show (where it wouldnt spoil the ratings). Lily took the deal.
* * *
Lily premiered, with Juke and Opal intact, on November 3, 1973. To CBSs chagrin, it attracted few viewers, ranking fifty-first out of sixty-six shows on prime time that week. Yet those in the know noticed. Six months later, Lily picked up Emmy Awards for best comedy-variety special and for the best writing on a comedy-variety special. A year after that, Lily writer Lorne Michaels used Lilys specials as a model for his own Saturday Night Live, inspired by how she threw together political stuff and mood pieces and moments of truth.
It was probably no coincidence that Richard and Lilys two sketches together revolved around courtships that were bold but hazy: their own relationship had the same tenor. For Richard, Lily was one of his few unrequited adult crushes. I love Lily, he told Rolling Stone in 1974, then confessed: Id like to ball her in all them different characters she does sometimes. Wouldnt you? I mean, have her around the house and have her do all thatbe Ernestine one minute. (Imitating Ernestine) Oh (snort, snort) just put it in the proper place. Thank you (snort, snort).
Witnessing Lilys creativity was sensual for Richard: the deeper and funnier it got, he wrote of their collaboration, the more I wanted to get in her pants. Fortunately, one might say, Lily didnt return those particular affections. Though instantly seduced by Richard as a performer, she was never seduced by him as a man: by 1973, she had been committed to Jane Wagner for several years and would remain so. As a consequence, Richard and Lily had a less troubled connection, uninflected by the possessiveness that Richard felt toward the other women in his life.
The only strains in their relationship, in fact, came when Lily was acting not as an artist onstage but rather as a feminist in conversation, questioning the prerogatives of men. When, at one point, Richard took her to an after-hours joint, she engaged some working girls with a rap about how they should consider keeping their earnings for themselves. Richard hustled her out, intuiting that she was taking them, and herself, to a dangerous place. And when she trespassed on Richards own prerogatives, even his darling Lily wasnt granted a free pass. At a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard once, she started talking feminism with Patricia Heitman, Richards companion at the time. Richard became so incensed that he turned their table over, letting the dishes clatter to the floor, and stormed out of the restaurant.
For Richard, there was life onstage and life off, and onstage was where he had the license to check his ego and admit his vulnerabilities. Collaborators like Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner offered him the equivalent of an airtight alibi: with them, he could flow into characters and explore his better self, with no worries of getting caught. It was no easy thing to bridge these two worldseven Lily, who had a more integrated sense of herself than Richard, acknowledged the difficulty of being at home with her variousness. When an interviewer asked her how she felt when she saw herself on TV, she shot back a riddle of her own: What does a chameleon see when it looks into a mirror?
* * *
Richards collaboration with Lily was a shaft of light in an otherwise dim time for his career. In 1972, he had worked on six movies; after the caper film Hit! wrapped in February 1973, he worked on none for nine months, and the only role he could anticipate was a small, low-paid cameo in Sidney Poitiers Uptown Saturday Night. The stalling of his film career puzzled him. Ive been trying to be a booty star, he said in October 1973. I was in about three movies and thought, Shit, you get one movie, you get a whole bunch of motherfuckin movies. I aint had a motherfucker call me about nothin. Richard had done more than simply wait for the phone to ring. Fresh off his work on the Blazing Saddles screenplay, he wrote and tried to peddle The Black Stranger, a revisionist western in which a black gunfighter and a voodoo woman drive out a villain who acts, suspiciously, a whole lot like John Wayne. The Los Angeles Times announced that Richard was setting up a production deal, but none materialized publicly.
It was out of desperation that Richard came back to stand-up comedy. I was starving to death, he said, explaining why hed returned to the stage after years of avoiding it. Kiss my ass, Jack! I have to get back to work. His manager, Ron DeBlasio, had a more sanguine view: he saw Richard as a breakout performer who, given the increased recognition for his film and TV work, should now play concerts, not club dates. DeBlasio booked him for a midnight concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. It was an intense scale-up in capacity, from a DC club like the Cellar Door (220 seats) to the Kennedy Centers stately Concert Hall (2,465 seats). Richard wondered if he was ready.
As preparation for the Kennedy Center show, Richard played a series of woodshedding dates at LAs Comedy Store in October 1973, and you can hear his nerves and rustiness as a performer on the recording of his first show there. He opened with Wino and Junkie, a routine that had customarily been his closer, and raced through it at a jumped-up clip. Then, for apparently the first time, he welcomed the audience with what became his signature greeting during his heyday: Hope Im funny cause [this] audience has been known to kick a little ass. Later, perhaps, this line became a mere reflex, but at this point he truly feared having to face the music. His new routines were untested or unelaborated, his old routines polished past the point of feeling fresh to him. Half an hour into the show, he made another unprecedented gesture: he asked the audience for requests. Whoa, horsey, a line from Rumpelstiltskin, the oldest and tamest of his routines, bounced back at him from the audiencereminding him why he never asked for requests. They lashed him to an older version of himself, one hed long tried to outrun.
Richard barely made it to DC for his Kennedy Center gig, delaying his trip to the LA airport till the last possible minute. In the run-up to the show, he was a nervous wreck, according to DeBlasio. He couldnt eat; he was irritable; he turned away from conversations or joined them to deliver insults. Backstage at the Kennedy Center, though, he came upon some head-turning news: his midnight concert was a sellout. In DCs black communityand especially among those for whom the witching hour marked just the start of their Saturday nightthe name Richard Pryor was golden.
Onstage, Richard beheld an almost exclusively black audience packing the lower level, box seats and two balconies, and he kicked into gear. He rode the crests of laughter, loosely switching between his established routines and his riffs on the news of the day, such as the energy crisis: Aint gonna affect us, cause I dont know no nigger buys more than $2 worth of gas anyway. The Washington Posts reviewer wrote that Pryor kept the audience guffawing in the aisles and also couldnt help observing that his scatological, outrageously lewd humor struck an interesting note of contrast in the Centers sedate Concert Hall. Never before, its fair to say, had a comic speculated frankly on a presidents sexual prowess (or lack thereof) from its stage.
The tide was turning for Richard. Shortly after the concert, DeBlasio fielded a phone call from Murray Swartz of Queen Booking, possibly the top agency representing black talent and certainly the top black-owned agency. After drifting nearly four years without an agent, Richard signed with Queen and found himself in the illustrious company of Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Sammy Davis Jr., and Gladys Knight and the Pips. Soon, he was routinely selling out large venues like New Yorks Lincoln Center and playing still-bigger arenas like the Oakland Coliseum. But it wasnt simply Queens muscle that opened doors: Richards breakthrough as a stand-up was powered by a live show that slayed audiences, and by a little album that forever altered the DNA of American comedy.

That Niggers Crazy was recorded in February 1974 at a San Francisco nightclub operated by Soul Train host Don Cornelius, and in front of an audience that was 90 percent black. Richards instructions to DeBlasio, who was in charge of producing the record, were minimal but insistent: Remember black people. After his experience with his first album, he wouldnt allow his material to be cherry-picked for the so-called mainstream. Richard himself came up with the albums title (sometimes forcibly abbreviated in ads as That N Crazy) and the albums cover, on which his face opens up in a grin that falls halfway between impish and diabolical. Shamelessness was his starting point and his forte.
That Niggers Crazy was an Everlasting Gobstopper of an album, changing flavors the more one savored it. On the first pass, it simply floored contemporary listeners with its audacity. When Richard confessed how he prayed to God after a too-quick ejaculation (Lord, dont let her know just let it stay heavy if not hard); when he imitated a cop in naked love with his power (Put your hands up, take your pants down and spread your cheeks!); or when, in the character of the swaggering Oilwell, he taunted a cop (Boy, you hit me with that stick, Im gonna bite your dick!), he was uttering the unutterable. As the crazy nigger, he gave voice to repressed anxieties, affronts, wishesthings too painful to remember or too dangerous to dwell upon.
On the second and third hearing, That Niggers Crazy revealed itself as a set of variations on a theme that Richard announced twelve minutes into the record: white folks do things a lot different than niggers do. Here he was less the crazy nigger than a sort of comic anthropologist, elaborating on the cultural divide between white and black America. The terms of that divide were familiarwhites were repressed, blacks uninhibited; whites were brittle, blacks unflappable (nothin can scare a nigger after 400 years of this shit)but Richards examples were fresh and vivid, with no plaster saints or tinhorn villains in sight. He directed much of his attention to black folks who were earthy, homegrown characters. There was his Aunt Maxine, who sucked a neck bone with such gusto that, by the time she threw it to the family dog, he looked at it, puzzled (What am I supposed to do with that motherfucker?). There was the wino who, chancing upon Dracula in the ghetto, told him to hightail to an orthodontist. There was the black preacher who, transposed into a black version of The Exorcist, informed the Lord that the devil is just acting the motherfuckin fool and asked, Could you exorcise this motherfucker to Cleveland [or] someplace? And so on: characters whose bravado came from embracing their idiosyncrasies. Black comedians in the generation after Richardwhether they performed on Saturday Night Live or Def Comedy Jam, MADtv or the Kings of Comedy tourhave drawn upon the example that he set here.
Less obviously, perhaps, That Niggers Crazy operated like a set of neon-lit folktales, shaking insight and laughter out of the harshest of predicaments. Just as folktales often surprise us with their ghastlinessstepmothers who banish their children, ogres who feed on a diet of bonesso Richard captivated the listener with a vision of the world that, from one angle, was beyond bleak. Thus the final line in his story of a black man getting frisked while out on the town: What nigger feel like having fun after that? Lets just go home, baby. You go home and beat your kids and shityou gonna take that shit out on somebody. He dramatized the desperation and violence of the world, which wasnt simply color-coded by race. In an absurdly grim scene, his junkie vomits in the unemployment bureau, then argues with a black security guard about who should clean up the mess. You dont clean up this shit, the guard threatens, I shoot your ass. The junkie replies, Well, who gonna clean up the blood, nigger? and laughs with self-satisfaction. For the moment he has, like a modern-day Brer Rabbit, bested the guard by outwitting him.
That Niggers Crazy was unquestionably a comedy landmark, but it might have been better still, more searching and provocative, if it had included Richards routine on dropping acid for the first time. Richard first developed Acid sometime in late 1973, and while he later performed it on Saturday Night Live and recorded a dazzling version for 1976s Bicentennial Nigger, the original version probed deeper. In both versions of Acid, Richard hits many of the same marks: he takes the drug with bluster (Baby, I can handle any motherfuckin thing!); feels a trippy rush; falls into terror (I dont remember how to breathe!); then loses himself in a parallel scene of a mind unspooling, the climax of 2001: A Space Odyssey. In this last section, Richards personal voice drops out, and for a long minute his stage routine has the suspended-in-air pacing of the Kubrick film. His audience is made to sit mute with concentration as Richard performs the scene in which Dave the astronaut deactivates HAL the computer:
(The sound of labored breathing, Dave in a spacesuit.)
HAL (gently and matter-of-fact as ever): Dave, dont. Im losing my mind, Dave.
Hi, my name is HAL 9000. I was embedded in 1992. My teacher taught me a song. Would you like to hear it?

One critic described Richards performance as like a ballet, his hands floating slow motion out of control, his head jerking this way and that as if possessed.
In the original version of Acid, Richard added an extra existential twist to the tale. During his reckoning with the abyss, a powerful voice comes out of a howling wind and assails Richard, urging him to let go of his identity as a nigger:
Voice From Beyond (whispering furiously, with an accusatory tone): Ive been waiting for about twenty-two years to meet your ass. Youve been bullshittin me, you know, with all that old jive nigger shit? You know, hidin behind them shields and shit? Instead of coming forward with all this energy?
You been layin back, posin an shit, bullshittin, motherfucker, well youre dead tonight Im gonna free you, brother. Im taking over where I rightfully belong; you givin up all that phony psychology you didnt learn.
Richard (speaking as if trapped in a slow-motion film): Wha-uh-tin-the-fu-kis-sap-ning-to-me-ee?
Voice From Beyond (calm now, comforting): You becoming a man. You just born. But Im afraid you wont be a nigger no more. But you wont be ignorant, either. The truth is everlasting.

In this version, Richard was pushed to be rebornand into a startling discovery about the fictions that ruled his life. In the mid-1960s, he had been Mr. Congeniality onstage; then, after his identity crisis at Las Vegass Aladdin Hotel in 1967, where he had refused to bow to pressures to censor his act, he had come to embrace the persona of the crazy nigger, a persona that allowed him to speak his own truth and violate whatever taboos required violation. Or so he thought. But what if nigger itself were just another mask, just another bit of jive? What if being that crazy nigger were a mere gimmick, designed to keep the deepest of anxieties at bay?
For a different sort of artist, this moment in Acid would have been unthinkable or untenablethe equivalent of those cartoon scenes where a character saws away at the branch he is sitting upon. But for Richard, Acid was a fulfillment of his larger program as an artist and a crazy nigger both. Once he settled on a truth, he was compelled to unsettle it. Once the foundation seemed solid under his feet, his mind turned to thoughts of earthquakes, quicksand, dynamite.
* * *
For a seeker like Richard, there was no easy resolution to the contradiction: race was both the thinnest of fictions and the hardest of truths. During an acid-induced dialogue with a voice from beyond, it might seem a mere illusion. But in the world, it raised your blood pressure, kept you unemployed, and got your ass strip-searched and hauled off to jail.
In early March of 1974, Richard was in Washington, DC, for a set of concerts when he was approached by a friend whod just been released from the Lorton Correctional Complex in Fairfax County, Virginia. The inmates, his friend said, were Pryor fans and wanted him to perform inside. Would he consider playing there?

A few days later, Richard was in a packed gymnasium at Lorton, surrounded by a thousand inmates; hed coaxed the promoter behind his DC shows to whip together a concert, and now he was on a bill with a local go-go band, a model and Inner Voices, an inmate singing group. The inmates in the audience wore Lortons unofficial uniformwool caps, fatigue jackets, jeans, work boots or sneakersand sat with the utmost attention for this rare reprieve from prison routine.
The men of Inner Voices filed onstage, some in long white robes, one in black, another without a shirt, and sang the just-released ballad by the Stylistics, You Make Me Feel Brand New. The lead singer reached out, at a tender moment, to one of the two women in the hall, and a wave of applause filled the room. On every other day at Lorton, there were no women to serenade.
Richard started weeping and didnt stop. Look at these guys, he told Ron DeBlasio. Theyll never get out. Look at the life they lead, how terrible it is.
When he took the stage, Richard connected with the men in the crowd, animating a set of characters familiar to them from their life before prison. With his pitch-perfect impersonations, he gave them a taste of the families in which theyd grown up, the players theyd known, the electricity of the streets theyd left behind. It was as if, through the magic of the stage, he had smuggled the world outside into Lorton.
The full show lasted three hours, or as long as the warden would allow. When it ended, an inmate presented Richard with a painting hed done. We wish we had more, he announced, but we give you our love, and this is a token of it.
After the show, the inmates crowded around Pryor and the other performers, according to The Washington Post, talking, touching, exchanging addresses. Then they exchanged something more: Richard had been wearing an expensive studded leather shirt, and he traded it for the shirt worn by a young inmate.
Richard left Lorton wearing prison denim. Seven weeks later, he arranged to have Inner Voices transportedwith a contingent of armed guards for securityto the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where they served as his opening act for four nights of performances. Richard introduced them personally at the Apollo, an unusual move for a headliner.
Seven weeks later still, Richard Pryor was Prisoner No. 2140-875 in the Los Angeles County Jail and wearing prison denim not by choice. He was serving a ten-day sentence for tax evasion, the result of the early years of his career, when he had acted like his grandmother in her brothel and kept his earningsan alleged $250,000 over four yearsoff the books. The judge, making an example of Richard around tax season, had mandated prison time.

The Nation,L,Imitations of Life | The Nation,"

Keira Knightley, Matthew Beard, Matthew Goode, Benedict Cumberbatch and Allen Leech in The Imitation Game


Crossword puzzles and cryptograms are tight-knit forms, designed to have only one solution. Movies, by contrast, can have wiggle room in their meanings and are more interesting to watch if they do. So what happens if you set out to make a movie about a great cryptanalyst? You might find yourself working at cross-purposes, as Morten Tyldum sometimes does in The Imitation Game, a pretty good movie based on a portion of the life of Alan Turing.
I say a portion because Turing, during his all-too-brief forty-one years, achieved more than any randomly selected 10 million people would likely pack into their collective life spans. It was certainly more than will fit into a single film. Working with screenwriter Graham Moore (who has relied on Andrew Hodgess 1983 biography), Tyldum necessarily omits large chunks of the career, from Turings stints in the United States before and during World War II (episodes that might have situated him among other researchers in a wider world) to his successful forays into fields beyond computer science, such as mathematical biology. For purposes of narrative concision and thematic focus, much of the life, too, is cut away. Tyldum merely alludes in passingcryptically, I might sayto Turings career as a long-distance runner, who competed credibly for a spot on Englands 1948 Olympic marathon team. Occasional images of Benedict Cumberbatch huffing around a track are inserted without explanation, leaving you to understand nothing about this behavior except the pain and desperation creasing the actors sliver-of-sky eyes.
Why should Cumberbatch seem to be fleeing something nameless and terrible, rather than running toward the prospect of a gold medal? Because in composing The Imitation Game, Tyldum uses the tight-knit method, presenting Turing only as a creature of secrets. Some (notably the German militarys Enigma code) he cracks to historic effect, while othersprincipally his love for menhe conceals for dear life.
Tyldum handles the latter aspect of the story so decorously that you might almost imagine Turing never had sex at all. Apart from one catastrophic encounter with a hustler, which happens off-screen, his relationships with men are limited in the movie to a sweet but chaste schoolboy friendship. And yet, locking in the theme of a clandestine life, Tyldum makes a frame story out of the police investigation of Turings homosexuality, his prosecution on charges of gross indecency and his untimely death (by suicide, according to the official report, though doubts have been raised). Reproducing what has become the conventional narrative about Turing, The Imitation Game retrospectively imposes a tragic meaning on all the events you see in flashback.
Let me say at once that it would be difficult to think of anything so stupid as the British governments punishing Alan Turing for acting on his sexual desires, unless it would be the royal pardon extended to him posthumously in 2013 for having done nothing wrong in the first place. Of course The Imitation Game has to address this horror. The problem is that Tyldum does so in a way that almost contradicts the point his screenplay has been laboring to make.
Three times in the course of the film, characters say, in praise of those who are seen as abnormal, Sometimes its the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine. If the characters had been poets rather than mathematicians, maybe this would have come out better. Still, you get the idea. The Imitation Game hammers home the moral that Turings homosexuality cannot be separated from everything else that made him exceptional. But by turning him into a case study in persecutionone among tens of thousands of victims cited in a closing titlethe film pushes Turing into a crowd, at the risk of reducing this dazzlingly multifarious figure to a single thing: a martyr to homophobia.
Fortunately, though, The Imitation Game is not a single thing, despite Tyldums efforts to make it so. The movie keeps getting away from him, in a good way. Sometimes an old-fashioned, low-budget visual effect, almost nostalgic in tone, lightens the mood, however inappropriately. Tyldum dramatizes the devastation of war through a charmingly obvious model shot (youre one level away from seeing a toy boat sunk in a bathtub) and visualizes the race against Nazi victory by superimposing the whirring rotors of Turings decryption machine over stock footage of marching jackboots. Such moments return you to the movie culture of the 1940s, tacitly acknowledging your distance from the events of the period while reminding you, as well as could be done through up-to-date illusionism, of the urgency of the struggle. Im glad to say Tyldum is even willing to deploy a little 1940s slapstick. When Turing wants to conduct a covert, late-night conference with a colleague, he tumbles headlong through a second-story window to the accompaniment of jokey music on the soundtrack. Youd almost think Eddie Bracken was sneaking in to see Betty Hutton.
Instead, its Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, giving performances that overflow the films constraints of theme and structure. In the role of Joan Clarkeone of the very few female cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park, and for a brief time Turings fianceKnightley is really required only to embody a victim of another sort: the hyperintelligent woman pushed aside by a society that will not recognize, let alone value, her abilities. To the degree that the script allows Knightley something more than pure victimhood, its through her development of a conspiracy of genius with Turing: she trades her guidance on how to get along with others (just a little) for his professional companionship and protection. But what a wonderful surplus of darting glances and cocky smiles Knightley throws in for freealong with displays of false ingenuousness and defiant pokes of her chin, stiffenings against opposition (her neck, spine and shoulders turned into a single block of ice) and meltings at favorable moments into a light-footed grace. Even when the conception of the movie begins to seem lifeless, Knightley bursts with a vitality that wont be contained.
The same is true, to an even greater degree, of Cumberbatchwhich is remarkable, given that the film insists on Turings having been such a guarded and self-controlled man. Aha, Asperger syndrome, youre meant to think, a little anachronistically, when Turing first shows up at Bletchley Park, speaking with the superb literal-mindedness that Cumberbatch has previously used on television as Sherlock Holmes. Sometimes to comic effect and sometimes eliciting a pang of pathos, Cumberbatchs Turing pretends to be oblivious to the feelings of everyone around him, meanwhile flashing hints to the audience that emotions are covertly churning beneath his surface. That The Imitation Game will eventually take you behind the blank face, showing you that Turing is not indifferent at all, is of course a part of the overly mechanistic scheme of the movie. It was not a foregone conclusion, though, that Cumberbatch would convey so much in the complex and exciting central sequence, in which Turing and his teammates get a sudden insight into Enigma, rush off to break the code and then, after a long moment of exhilaration, fall into queasy sobriety, having realized that to maintain the tremendous advantage theyve just won, they must permit a certain number of successful German attacks to continue. In the midst of it all, when Turing is too overcome to maintain his mask, Cumberbatch comes close to weeping with wonder and relief. Tyldum keeps the moment brief enough so that it doesnt become cornyand Cumberbatch plays it with such deep conviction that you dont think about his performance, or even Turing, but about the uncanny paths that people follow as they make history.
Two of the less consequential of those paths have resulted in The Imitation Games being released in close proximity to The Theory of Everything, James Marshs biopic of Stephen Hawking. Neither film is a masterpiece. But Tyldums movie, to its credit, is about people with complicated, sometimes unattractive emotions, who pursue intellectual work that sometimes involves rivalries, ambitions and moral qualms in a world that is more strange than inspiring. If you have time this season to watch only one movie about a tormented British scientific geniusand trust me, you dothen you know which to pick.
* * *
The Andantino movement of the posthumous Piano Sonata in A major is achingly beautiful even by Franz Schuberts standardssweetly sad and deceptively simple in its opening statement, then chiming with echoes like unbearable memoriesand so ought to be off-limits to any sensible filmmaker looking for soundtrack music. No movie could live up to the piece. Nuri Bilge Ceylan surely knows that; but never lacking for nerve, he has infiltrated the Andantino anyway throughout Winter Sleep and gets away with itwhich tells you more about this gorgeous, bitter, sometimes funny, ultimately heartbreaking film than youll learn from mere credentials, such as the Palme dOr it won at the most recent Cannes festival.
For one thing, the choice of Schubert tips you off that Ceylan is in no hurry. He is willing to let the characters and their situation reveal themselves to you in good time, bringing one layer after another to the surface at the daily pace of domestic affairs anywhere, and with the brooding, repetitive attention thats especially common in provincial life. You will recognize the atmosphere from Chekhovs stories, which the director and Ebru Ceylan (his wife and co-screenwriter) have adapted for the movie, transposing them to the cold, uneventful setting of present-day Cappadocia. Its a region of mist, valleys and steep mountain paths, increasingly popular with foreign tourists but deeply pitted with rural poverty, where the houses are built into cones of volcanic rock that sprout everywhere like gigantic stone mushrooms.
This is where Aydin (Haluk Bilginer), a gray, preening, thick-bearded stage actor, has retired after a less than glorious career. He lives off the properties he inherited from his father, runs a picturesquely folkloric hotel that caters to tourists, and steeps himself in aggravation with the women in his life: his sister Necla (Demet Akbag), a dependent, middle-aged divorce whose presence in the hotel none too secretly generates resentment (for which she returns a full measure, and then some), and his wife Nihal (Melisa Szen), who is much younger than Aydin, very beautiful and might as well have left for Istanbul years ago, for all the love she shares with her husband.
Please support our journalism. Get a digital subscription for just $9.50!
The locale is grandmore expansive and otherworldly than anything youll see in Interstellarbut the tensions that run through it seem at first to be no more than petty, laughable quarrels. Necla takes pleasure in puncturing her brothers pretensions of being a journalist and author. (Like many grand men of the provinces, he leaves his affairs to the management of flunkies, the better to uphold the standards of culture.) Nihal performs her duties entertaining her husbands friends (shes as good an actor as he ever was), seethes quietly at his self-flattery, and takes her mind off herself by organizing local charity work. As for Aydin, he finds it easy to mock and belittle the two women. Hes busy researching his great history of Turkish theater (which hes going to start writing any day now) and chatting enviously with the hotel guests, who are free to go elsewhere.
Nothing very serious seems capable of intruding into this life, until a rock is tossed into it. The culprit is a schoolboy: the son of one of the poor tenants whom Aydin prefers to ignore and the nephew of Hamdi (Serhat Mustafa Kili), the towns threadbare, unctuously servile imam. Once the rock is thrownan act of childish vandalism, undertaken in response to an eviction proceeding that Aydin does not want to know aboutmore than just a window cracks, for all of these characters.
Critics, myself included, sometimes make the error of mystifying visual style, talking vaguely about this directors construction of cinematic space or that ones dramatically meaningful edits. Ceylan is so visually overwhelmingplease, if you see Winter Sleep, do whatever you can to watch it on a real screen, in CinemaScopethat its hard not to fall into such double-talk. Perhaps I can say that Winter Sleep has interior views (of Aydins library, for example) that are so rich in detail that your eye lingers happily no matter how long the shot is held, and exterior views that unfold like a Chinese scroll, and watchful close-ups that allow you to think youve understood the characters feelings, until something crumples behind the face or a hand suddenly intrudes to deliver a slap.
The style of Winter Sleep is big and versatile enough to handle everything from a drunken, bathetic bachelor dinner to the capture of a wild horse beside a river. But the image that most haunts me is neither a close-up nor a long shot, neither an interior nor an exterior, but a combination of them all: a view of Nihals devastated face, seen behind a second-floor window from the courtyard below. Its almost the end of the movie, when shes nearby but silent and unreachable, and the landscape, reflected in the glass, is inescapably present but immaterial. The last notes of the Schubert are dying away on the soundtrack, and Winter Sleep is closing with them, in perfect harmony.

Last month, I signed a contract to have my collected poems published. Kirsten Porter, who teaches at Marymount University, will be editing this book. Ive spent the last few weeks reading my poems from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Each poem, I guess, contains my flesh and blood. They were all an outcome of my seduction by language. Some of the poems found their beginnings in my mouth, others in my ear. Ive always liked what words could do. I look at poems the way I do my children. Poems and language change. They bring joy, happiness, disappointment and sometimes grief. It seems these days that language is pushing against old barriers and traditional values. Every year, new words enter our vocabulary. Old nasty ones punch us in the head.
How we sound is always different and new but maybe just the changing, the same.
There comes a day when language asks for the car keys. There comes a time when we find ourselves a witness to an accident. Is that time now? Is our language broken and suddenly in need of repair? Im not a linguist, or even a person who speaks a second language. Im a poet who once wrote, The ear is an organ made for love. This was an outgrowth of listening to the changing tenor coming from the voices of people on sidewalks, buses and trains. What would Walt Whitman hear if taking a walk these days? Would he hear America singing? Would our language be filled with hope or would every conversation and song be one of despair?
Its interesting how certain words are now used in the news media. Whats an editor to do? Like the free market, it seems we want our ears to always be open. Yet, at what point do we become concerned with our moral imagination? When do we try to restrict the use of racist and sexist terms? And what about profanity? What happens when the language of protest is needed to remove the language of oppression? If we live in violent times, is it possible or even desirable to have passive thought and speech? Must we overthrow language, too?
Please support our journalism. Get a digital subscription for just $9.50!
What should one chant at a march? If we wish to change and improve our society, should we embrace what might be defined as righteous speech? If we desire a movement which is non-violent, shouldnt our spiritual undertaking also be reflected in what we say to those who stand in our way? Where are the new sermons for our souls?
I just started keeping what I call My New Dictionary. Ive been creating new words and terms. For example, is there such a thing as race porn? Are there things that circulate through social media regarding race that we become addicted to? Might we prefer cases of police brutality more than black success stories? Does race porn make one susceptible to rumors that often circulate on the Internet?
When I find terms in the media I feel might help provide clarity to what is happening in our society, I also add them to my dictionary. In a copy of The New Yorker I came across the expression contaminated moral environment. Ive been saying this as well as making reference to the concept of the Beloved Community. If we believe words are powerful, then we must acknowledge they have the power for good as well as evil. Language becomes a tool when we begin to think about how to rebuild our world. There are many myths that describe how a spell was placed over an individual or kingdom. Maybe just a word spoken by a magician or sorcerer. There is the story of Jesus calling Lazarus from his grave. What should one say to young activists today? So many have risen up, but have the right words been truly spoken? Is it possible to arrive in heaven before the devil knows youre dead?

On August 28, a klatch of high-level representatives of some of the most anti-union groups in the country gathered on a stage at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC. They had come together, on the eve of Labor Day, to discuss a new scheme for dismantling workers rights: turning one of the most potent weapons in the anti-labor arsenalso-called right-to-work laws (RTW)on cities and counties.
The possibilities of rolling out a local RTW [campaign] in a non-RTW state deserves a full-court press by those of us who care about free market economics and allowing communities to make the best decisions for their people, declared Jon Russell, a baby-faced partisan of the right who was sandwiched between Andrew Kloster of the Heritage Foundation and Patrick Gleason of Americans for Tax Reform. Flanking them were James Sherk, also of the Heritage Foundation, and William Messenger, the attorney from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation who argued Harris v. Quinn last year before the Supreme Court.
Russell is director of the American City County Exchange (ACCE), a new offshoot of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which seeks to replicate ALECs state-level successes at the local level. As such, he is well poised to help mobilize, and coordinate, any efforts to bring right-to-work laws to the local level. Our parent organization, ALEC, has model policy on RTW for the states. Its very plausible we could see model policy available for local governments in non-RTW states, Russell explained. No doubt, the notion of crafting model policies will be part of the conversation on December 4, during ACCEs winter meeting, where local right-to-work will be one of only two labor proposals being discussed.
The option of passing right-to-work laws at the state level was granted by Congress in 1947 in the Taft-Hartley Act, which CIO president Philip Murray described as conceived in sin, and President Truman denounced as a slave labor bill. In the decades since, organizations such as the National Right to Work Committee have put enormous resources into pushing state right-to-work laws across the country. Their reasoning is straightforward: right-to-work laws offer a way to defund labor from the inside by permitting workers not to pay unions for the cost of representing them, even though these workers are benefiting from the representation. They are the equivalent of allowing people to choose to pay or not pay taxes for the services provided by a democratically elected government.
Since Taft-Hartley was passed, business and anti-union groups have successfully pushed for right-to-work laws in twenty-four states, and have tried numerous times to pass a national-right-to-work law. But they have generally avoided pursuing them at the local level, since there is nothing in the law that would seem to allow the approach. Now, however, some of labors leading antagonists have begun floating the idea, threatening to use what they are calling an ambiguity in the law to bring the right-to-work fight to some of the last, labor-friendly outposts in the country. Their goal seems to be to create beachheads in non-right-to-work states, such as Illinois, Ohio, or even New York, where the practice could spread and flourish. Whether the idea has any legal standing, or whether its simply being promoted to halt progressive momentum on the local level, its boosters have racked up enough past success that workers and labor-rights advocates should be concerned.
It is unclear where or even when this latest push originated, but the inspiration for the panel came from a paper released two days before the panel by the two Heritage analysts, James Sherk and Andrew Kloster. (Heritage, which has long been a hothouse for conservative ideas, is now led by former Senator Jim DeMint, who waged a war in the Senate on all things labor and famously said, I really dont think that collective bargaining has any place in representative government.)
In the paper, which is titled Local Governments Can Increase Job Growth and Choices by Passing Right-to-Work Laws, the authors extol what they consider the virtue of right-to-work laws, most notably their ability to undermine unions. They argue that right-to-work laws have effectively diminished unions size, power, and funding, and that such laws reduce the aggressiveness of union organizers. They point to a study that on average, union organizing falls 50 percent within five years of enacting a RTW law. As an added bonus, the two assert that right-to-work laws attract businesses, though they have trouble explaining why this is the case if, as they suggest, these laws dont lead to lower wages. They settle on the idea of freedom and entrepreneurial integrity, making it seem as if companies want nothing more than to pay their workers well and free them from the coercive power of unions. In doing so, they use an argument that was developed and refined by the National Right to Work Committee: that employers and employees have a natural alliance, and their common enemy is the union.
Beyond these arguments, the authors dedicate a fair amount of attention to the legal question of whether local right-to-work laws are viablea discussion that was echoed during the panel two days later. The courts have long held that when Congress passed the NLRA in 1935, it intended to create a unified national labor law. However, in the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress created a narrow exception with regard to right-to-work laws, allowing only a State or Territory to pass such laws. The essence of Sherk and Klosters legal argument, as well as their co-panelists, is that the phrase State or Territory is ambiguous as to cities, towns and counties, making these prime targets for right-to-work ordinances.
If this sounds like a bizarre and over-broad reading of the law, thats because it almost certainly is. Wilma Liebman is an expert in labor law who was appointed by Bill Clinton to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1997, reappointed twice by Bush, and served as chair under Obama until 2011 when her term expired. When asked by The Nation whether she believes that the NLRA permits this reading, she replied, No. And its not even a close question. She read aloud the relevant provision of the act to me, paused, and then explained, Section 14(b) is clear. It says state or territory. That means no local or municipal ordinances.
However, even as Liebman explained how there was little room to find the ambiguity that Heritage and company were arguing for, she paused, considered the current conservative federal judiciary, and equivocated. There may well be some judges in front of whom this argument will be persuasive, she said.
Though the idea only seems to have made its way to Washington, DC, in the late summer, it is already being discussed in a few states. Bruce Rauner, who just won the Illinois governors seat, campaigned on the idea of right-to-work zones, which his campaign website described as allowing local communities to decide whether workers must join a union in order to get a job. Rauner knows well that he would not be able to pass a state right-to-work law in Illinois, where Democrats have long controlled the state House and Senate, so he is effectively encouraging Illinois cities and towns to pass their own ordinances.
Emil Totonchi, the General Counsel of Teamsters Local 705 in Chicago, believes that these so-called right-to-work zones would not ultimately pass legal muster; but, he acknowledged, the mere concept is worrisome.
It would be an administrative headache, for both companies and unions, if localities could pass right-to-work laws, he explained. Think about the west of Chicago. You have all these tiny municipalities, many of which youd never knew existed. Theyre tiny. Imagine having right-to-work in one town and next door there isnt. And these towns could change the law back and forth. How does a local, which covers many of these areas, deal with that?
But that may be precisely the point. Liebman explained that fights over these laws legitimacy, let alone their existence could be a huge distraction and drain on resources for unions.
Such a scenario may have already begun playing out in Kentucky, where the powerful Republican Senate President, Robert Stivers, sent a letter on September 8a mere two weeks after the Heritage panelto the state attorney general asking whether a county can pass a right-to-work ordinance. Louisville Metro County Councilman Ken Fleming took this cue and has been talking about introducing a Louisville right-to-work ordinance as either stand-alone legislation or as an amendment to the increased minimum-wage ordinance that is currently being debated. Democratic Councilwoman Attica Scott told The Nation that Flemings approach appeared to be an early attempt to stall the minimum wage ordinance by introducing a poison pill. She expressed doubt that this effort will go anywhere now, but felt it was the first step in a long process.
Unfortunately, early polling in Louisville found approximately the same majority of people favored an increased minimum wage as a local right-to-work ordinance. Many workers rights advocates I spoke to in Louisville explained this result away as too many people taking the phrase right-to-work at face value, and not fully understanding that it is usually used to defund unions, depress wages, and make labor organizing more difficult.
Though this explanation may be true, it does nothing to counter the vulnerability that may be exposed by this new push for local right-to-work legislation. Whether its the message or the legislations content that appeals to voters, highly financed local referenda and carefully crafted public relations campaigns can lead to an even more difficult environment for labor organizing.

Despite conservatives best efforts to package this as an open question, the few courts that have considered the viability of such local laws have overturned them. In Kentucky, the labor movement is placing its hopes on a 1965 decision by the Commonwealths highest court that overturned a right-to-work ordinance passed by the city of Shelbyville several years earlier. The court explained: We believe Congress was willing to permit varying policies at the state level, but could not have intended to allow as many local policies as there are local political subdivisions in the nation. Wilma Liebman put it more bluntly when she explained that the NLRA was intended to create a national labor policy, and not intended to break the country up into small fiefdoms.
However, even though there is no legal precedent for this proposal, and it seems to be based on a contrary reading of the law, one should be careful about dismissing this idea. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which could provide some of the legal muscle for the push for local right-to-work, has had a lengthy string of cases that seemed like long shots when they began, only to have a conservative Supreme Court ultimately agree with them. And, indeed, several of the panelists at the Heritage seemed to relish the possibility that lawsuits might drive the issue up through the federal courts and on to the nations highest court. They recognized that the legal fight would be costly for cities, but seemed confident that one of various conservative legal organizations would pick up the tab. Until then, workers advocates may have to deal with another front on the war on workers.

The Nation,L,Why Hagels Departure Is a Victory For War Hawks  | The Nation,"

Chuck Hagel talks about his resignation during an event in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)


This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com.
It was the end of the road for Chuck Hagel last week and the Washington press corps couldnt have been more enthusiastic about writing his obituary. In terms of pure coverage, it may not have been Ferguson or the seven-foot deluge of snow that hit Buffalo, New York, but the avalanche of news reports was nothing to be sniffed at. There had been a changing of the guard in wartime Washington. Barack Obamas third secretary of defense had gone down for the count. In the phrase of the moment, he had resigned under pressure. Sayonara, Chuck!
With a unanimity that crossed political lines, the accounts read as if written by a single reporter. The story went something like this: two years earlier, President Obama had brought in Hagel, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former Republican senator with a reputation for being leery about the overuse of American military power, to wind down the war in Afghanistan, rein in military critics and put the Pentagon budget on something closer to a peacetime footing. After a bruising Senate confirmation hearing from which he never recovered, he proved poor at messaging the presidents policies, had a crappy relationship with National Security Adviser (and Obama buddy) Susan Rice, proved a weak manager at the Department of Defense as well as a weak link in the Obama national security team, and could never break into the presidents tight-knit circle of insiders whoeveryone agreedhad a nasty habit of micromanaging Americas wars (rather than, it seemed, letting the military do what needed to be done). In the end, the president lost confidence in him. It was a mutual firing or at least Hagel had advanced somewhat voluntarily toward the edge of the cliff before being pushed off.
A subcategory of Hagel reports also bloomed, again adding up to something like a single story. In them, various journalists and commentators offered instant speculation on whom the president would invite to fill Hagels post. Topping everyones short list: Senator and former Army Ranger Jack Reed of Rhode Island, war fightin liberal and former Pentagon official Michle Flournoy (much beloved by neocons and Republicans), and hawkish former Pentagon weapons buyer Ashton Carter (the ultimate nominee). Unfortunately for the press, Reed and Flournoy promptly made mincemeat out of the collective wisdom of the moment, emphatically removing their names from consideration. Politico reported the Flournoy rejection this way: Flournoys withdrawal comes amid speculation President Barack Obama is looking for a candidate who would be deferential to a White House thats increasingly exerting control over Pentagon decisions. Nothing, however, could stop the march of the news, whose focus simply switched to other potential job applicants. Striking was the eagerness of assorted journalists and pundits to act like employment agency headhunters vetting exactly the same list of candidates for the president.
Such journalism, of course, qualifies as the very definition of insiderdom and it led, implicitly or explicitly, to the crowning of Barack Obama as a war president for the final two years of his term. In the end, however, the media was less reporting on developments than reproducing them. The result: a record as collectively claustrophobic as post-9/11 Washington itself.
These days, its often pointed out by those who pass for Washington critics of the Obama administration that the crises are backing up like a Thanksgiving traffic jam across a remarkable swath of the planetand that the presidents national security team has proven dysfunctional when it comes to dealing with them. Its seldom acknowledged, however, that the most essential crisis isnt in Ukraine or Iraq or Syria or Afghanistan or Iran, but in Washington. There, a bankrupt thirteen-year-old policy of war to the horizon remains, unbelievably enough, in the ascendancy and war fever seems to be breaking out yet again.
In this context, its curious that four crucial aspects of war, American-style, were missing from the blitz of Hagel reportage. Heres a rundown.
1. The War Party Ascendant: Its always best to start with the obvious, even if everyone prefers to ignore it. So lets begin with the simple fact that the recent midterm elections swept the Republicans into the Senate in dominating numbers and strengthened their already dominating control of the House of Representatives. In war terms, this has only one meaning: a flock of new (and old) hawks heading into Washington. In truth, though, on such issues there is really only one party in the nations capital and thats the War Party. In addition, if Washington commentary is to be believed, the next secretary of defense will be an unmitigated war-fighter. The math for dummies explanation on that: no other candidate nominated by a Democratic president would have a hope in hell of making it through a confirmation process overseen by the assumed new head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain. Add in an occupant of the Oval Office resigned to war presidency status and you can already see the big picture coming into focus.
Recent moves have only emphasized the latest war trajectory. Just post-election, the president doubled the number of advisers in Iraq (with hints of more boots on the ground to come and the possibility of actual combat troops lurking somewhere in the prospective future). Next came news that those advisers were being hustled into the country at a double-time pace. Soon after that came word that more air powerA-10 Warthog jets and Reaper droneswas being transferred to the Iraq/Syria theater.
Meanwhile, in a reversal of a long-stated positionthat the American combat role in Afghanistan was to end this yearthe president recently issued a secret directive green-lighting just such a role, both on the ground and in the air, for 2015. Soon after, the new Afghan president, clearly under American pressure, lifted a ban on controversial US-supported night raids in his country, and reports began filtering out that the trajectory of withdrawal was about to end and extra US troops would be added to the Afghan mix in 2015.
In other words, in the countrys two most active war zones, escalation and mission creep are already the order of the day. Meanwhile, the pressure of Congressional war hawks has only been increasing when it comes to the Obama administrations single major, unwarlike diplomatic initiative that might stand some chance of success: the Iranian nuclear talks. At the same time, pressure to act more fiercely on Ukraine, including allowing the Pentagon to sell arms to its military, was on the rise.
Admittedly, the War Party has its factions and its disagreements. Its members are quite capable of savaging each other. (Just check out what Senator McCain did to Chuck Hagel at his confirmation hearings for secretary of defense and then what he did to President Obama in defense of Hagel after his removal from office.) One thing is evident, though: in the twilight of the Obama era, the power of the War Party is on the rise, along with that of the national security state.
And so far were only talking about surface manifestations of bedrock reality in Washington. After all, ever since 9/11, that citys political denizens have considered themselves in an eternal wartime. Of course, part of everyday life in that war capital involves Republicans and Democrats scrambling for political advantage by squabbling endlessly over whos rash and whos a wimp when it comes to war policy.
The Republicans brand the president incompetent or far worse, while the president (the man who shot Osama bin Laden) endlessly thanks the troops for their valor and service while donning military paraphernalia to emphasize his strength and resolve. But underneath all the maneuvering, the War Party thrives. You simply cant operate in Washington without in some fashion declaring your fealty to wartime thinking and the sanctified post-9/11 dead air that goes with it. No alternative possibilities, no other options are on that table on which all options are always said to sit in the nations capital. Should you not toe the line, the national security equivalent of excommunication is in order. Washington rules, in Andrew Bacevichs phrase, do rule the day, while new thinking is unwelcome.
Recent exhibit number one: as November wound down, Rand Paul, the son of the countrys leading libertarian non-interventionist and a man who clearly has his eye on the White House, felt obliged to more or less literally declare war on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in order to pledge his fealty to the War Party.
On this issue, as the Hagel coverage indicates, Washington is a suffocating place when it comes to any thought that hasnt been thought before. (When, by the way, was the last time you heard someone in that town mention the word peace?) In the end, Hagel, who came to regret his reluctant vote to invade Iraq, evidently proved an uncomfortable fit.
2. Election 2016 as an Intra-War Party Affair: In the wake of the invasion of Iraq, Bush v. Kerry in 2004 was, of course, a war election; 2008, however, proved a curious rarity, an election about war in which Americans generally thought they had voted for an anti-war candidate (as, of course, did the Nobel Prize Committee, whichto use an ill-chosen phrasejumped the gun in 2009 by awarding its peace prize to Barack Obama just as he was about to officially surge in Afghanistan). The 2012 election was a status quo one in which, thanks to the bin Laden raid, the president had inoculated himself from Republican charges of wimpism even as he had seemingly fulfilled his previous campaign promise to end the war in Iraq.
2016 is already shaping up as a War Party election all the way. It goes without saying that whichever Republican candidate emerges from the pack will be a war-firster, while the leading Democratic candidate of the moment, Hillary Clinton, is another war-fightin liberal of the first order. No wonder Flournoy, who refused to be considered for secretary of defense now, would reportedly like to work for Clintons future administration in the same capacity. Sign of the times: Clinton already seems to be gathering support from a crew of neocons who had their moment in the Bush years and evidently hope to have it again. Right now, no matter who wins in 2016, its shaping up to be war to the horizon in Washington.
3. The Military Rides Ever Higher: Among the strangest aspects of the Hagel coverage was the picture painted of the relationship between the military and the White House in this period. Despite a mind-boggling infusion of funds since 9/11 and the exponential growth of the national security state, reading the Hagel stories you might be forgiven for thinking that the military was an essentially powerless, oppressed, and frustrated crew under the thumb of hopeless goof-balls at the White House. (Nor was it ever suggested that, constitutionally speaking, this is exactly what the relationship should be, no matter who occupies the Oval Office as commander in chief.)
In fact, there are signs that the military, while indeed frustratedwho wouldnt be given the last thirteen years of American war and the prospects for the latest conflict in the Middle East?is actually riding ever higher in the nations capital.
In this context, the person to keep an eye on is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey. If Hagel lost the presidents confidence, according to numerous reports Dempsey is the one who gained it. If Hagel wasnt much for messaging, the same cant be said of Dempsey. Hes been testifying up a storm before Congress and commenting in significant ways on war policy in the Middle East. Though hes only the head of the staff, he has increasingly sounded like a bona fide civilian secretary of defense, speaking out on foreign policy issues, including US relations with Israel and the importance of making American troops available for actual combat duty in Iraq. (This is, of course, something the president had emphatically ruled out). Hes also spoken in ways that have not been common for military commanders in our civilian system of government. He has politely contradicted the president on a number of occasions. He is also credited with getting Obama to launch the first airstrikes of the new American war in the Middle East.
It seems clear that the military high command has struggled with this president over war policy since 2009, when a fierce set of arguments over how fully to surge in Afghanistanthe conflict the president had called the right war in his election campaignburst into view. Generally, though, little has been seen of this struggle since then. Still, to believe that a military clearly frustrated by its wars and a high command that now fears another campaign on the road to nowhere in Iraq and Syria is under the thumb of the president and his insular national security team is to mistake a fantasy construct for reality.
4. A Failed Experiment in War: Above all, its a wonder that all those journalists and commentators writing about Hagel expressed neither amazement nor befuddlement when it came to accepted thinking in Washington about war, American-style. The nations capital has been conducting an experiment in war-making for more than thirteen years now: there have been full-scale invasions and occupations, counterinsurgency struggles that lasted years, special ops raids of every sort, the application of overwhelming air power in a variety of ways, including an air intervention in Libya, drone assassination campaigns across the backlands of the Greater Middle East, the loosing of cruise missiles, even the first cyberwar in history. Trillions of dollars have been spent; American troops have been deployed to war zones over and over again; almost 7,000 American lives have been lost (while thousands of active duty soldiers and reservists have, in the same period, committed suicide); tens of thousands of Americans have been wounded in action, hundreds of thousands of civilians and enemy fighters in those war zones have died, and millions of people have been uprooted and sent into internal exile or forced out of their countries. In the process, significant parts of the Greater Middle East and more recently Africa have been destabilized in devastating ways.
Think of it as a radical experiment involving what our latest two presidents have called the greatest force for freedom in the history of the world and the finest fighting force that the world has ever known. Despite ongoing wars and operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, among other places, the results of that experiment are in. No single war, intervention, or minor conflict in which the US military has taken part in these years has even come close to achieving the objectives set out by Washington, and most have proven outright disasters. In just about every case, armed intervention, whatever form it took, demonstrably made matters worse, increased the destabilization of whatever country or region was involved, and led to the creation of more extremists and terrorists.

Imagine for a moment a lab that ran a series of experiments for thirteen straight years in almost every imaginable combination through one disastrous failure after another and then promoted the experimenters and agreed to let them repeat the process all over again. This would defy logic or simply good sense anywhere but in Washington.
To summarize: thirteen years later, the War Party is ascendant. It controls Congress. The president is visibly, if with his usual reluctance, placing his bets on war. The military is riding high. The end of all calls for serious Pentagon budget cuts is clearly in sight. And more of the same is undoubtedly in the works, no matter who wins the 2016 election.
Thats the new Washington. Peacetime? A fantasy creation of lefties, libertarians and noodle heads. Peace? A dirty word that no self-respecting politician would be caught using.
Meanwhile, the war hawks are crying out for more. At the moment, all the pressure in Washington is focused on the ramping up of its various wars and crises. Iraq War 3.0 and Syria War 1.0 are to expand. Afghanistan seems again to be a war on the rise. The pressure is increasing to make Cold War 2.0 ever hotter and to ensure that negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal will prove less than fruitful. Drone wars are ongoing. Special forces ops are raiding away. Thirteen years later, we are yet again floating on what seems to be a rising, not ebbing, tide of war and the one qualification for a new secretary of defense is that he or she be a hot, not a cold, warrior.
This is the working definition of a bankrupt policy and yet you could read about the latest changes in Washingtons war establishment until you were goggle-eyed and never quite know it.
Congratulations, then, are in order for the War Party. In the face of a seemingly obdurate reality, it has somehow perfected a system of war boosterism that operates like a dream (though some might call it a nightmare). When it comes to war, in other words, Washington is now effectively insulated from failure. There may be seventeen major interlocked intelligence outfits in town, but rest assured, theres no intelligence in sight. So party on!

"
The Nation,L,No Fate but Entropy | The Nation,"

Steve Carell (left) and Channing Tatum in Foxcatcher


Its a basic move in freestyle wrestling: a sudden step forward while dropping to one knee. If you saw a man practicing this action alone, during warm-ups, youd almost imagine he was sweeping into a low bow before an invisible lord. Watch the same move in a match, and youll see it flow into a lunge that knocks the opponent to the mat. For a split second in the choreography of wrestling, aggression can be indistinguishable from submission, violence from courtesy. Stretch that blink of an eye into several years of narrative timea bit longer than two hours on the screenand you have the ambiguous tension that drives Foxcatcher.
Directed by Bennett Miller from a screenplay by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, Foxcatcher is a fictionalized account of the catastrophic interplay between two Olympic champion wrestlers, the brothers Dave and Mark Schultz, and one of the wealthiest men in America, John E. du Pont. Perhaps youll recall an outline of the facts from reports of the murder trial. In the late 1980s, around the time he turned 50, du Pont decided to convert a part of his family estate in Pennsylvania into a training facility for wrestlers. He sponsored US amateurs for international competition (calling the athletes hed collected Team Foxcatcher, after the name hed given the property) and also took up the sport himself, sometimes entering senior matches and sometimes sparring with his facilitys much younger, semi-dependent residents. In 1996, this late athletic career came to an end when du Pont abruptly rolled up to Dave Schultz, who had been living at Foxcatcher, and without warning shot him dead. No motive was ever discovered.
Miller stays true to life in Foxcatcher by declining to explain the murder, perhaps because its the part of the story that interests him least. Another filmmaker might have used the old noir device of starting with the gunshots and then telling the story in flashback, so the killing would take on the significance of something that had been fated. In Foxcatcher, though, the only fate is that of entropy, which sends the main characters downward in a three-strand spiral, even as they pursue world conquest in sports and boast (in du Ponts case) of national renewal. To Miller, murder is just one more damned thing that happens in a story filled with dread but no suspense: a fable of the misunderstanding, heartbreak, irony and absurdity that can abound in America when two social classes grapple in mutual desire and animosity.
To be fair, family life in Foxcatcher also has its push and pull. As the movie begins, in the late Reagan era, you see Mark deliver an uplifting speech about hard work and persistenceit might have been uplifting, anyway, if the kids in the grammar-school auditorium hadnt been so sparse, and if Mark hadnt seemed to begrudge them the words that he drags out of memory, one by oneafter which he collects a paycheck of $20, made out incorrectly to his older brother. Its a painful way to introduce a gold medalist; and as Channing Tatum plays him, you already notice the hurt in Marks unsmiling gaze, the anger in his jutting lower lip, the brute force pent up in his side-to-side gait. By the next scene, when Mark goes to the gym to be coached by Davea bearded and bespectacled Mark Ruffaloyoure already primed for him to rear up and smash into his brothers face. (Does Mark mean to cause harm, or is the attack merely misjudged? Impossible to say.) But you might not expect the workout to begin as it does, almost like one of the groping slow dances that this college gym must sometimes witness. The brothers embrace, caress, drape their heads over each others shoulders. When Mark draws blood, the perpetually calm and kindly Dave simply wipes it away with a swatch of his white T-shirt.
If theres a locked-in, sweaty love between Mark and Davecomplicated on Marks side with resentment at being the junior Schultz, the one whos apparently jobless, the bachelor brother who eats his meals of slop alone at a bare tabletheres nothing but cold air and disdain between John du Pont and his aged mother. Though youre made to understand that the mother (Vanessa Redgrave) continues to rule the family estate and her middle-aged son with it, she does so from a deliberate distanceone thats difficult to gauge, because Miller never allows you to grasp the layout of the property or even figure out the configuration of the main house. Like the lower-class characters, you know only that the lawn outside the front door is big enough to handle a helicopter, as seen when du Pont first summons a puzzled Mark to Foxcatcher to propose a residency. An aide tells Mark that the mother is out there somewhere and must not be spoken to, but for the most part she remains an unseen presence, all the more chilling in her disapproval for being remote. No wonder theres a false note from the start in du Ponts lord-of-the-manor posturing: the way he slouches too far into the sofa cushions when he interviews Mark, undermining his show of being relaxed, or tilts his head back as if peering down at a subordinate, only to make himself look as if hes coping with stuffed sinuses.
An extraneous irony of this tale of the search for competitive glory is that so much of its publicity has focused on the Oscar-worthiness of Steve Carells performance as du Pontor, Im tempted to say, the performance of the makeup artists and costumers, who have made Carell almost unrecognizable. He really does justify all their work, playing du Pont as the most preening and yet sadly awkward figure in a movie thats obsessed with physical expression. (Just as successfully, if more predictably, Carell also catches every nuance of du Ponts dialogue: the solemnly hilarious self-aggrandizement, the flattery that can turn in a moment into vitriol, the grandiloquence about being a renovator of Americas moral fiber.) But the less ostentatious metamorphoses in Foxcatcher seem to me just as praiseworthy: Tatums transformation of himself, with only a few adjustments of his carriage, into Mark, who seems so dangerous at first and proves to be so vulnerable, and Ruffalos channeling of his fundamental repertoire as an actordignity and intelligenceinto a specific and fully grounded realization of Dave.
Hes the man who cant be boughtor at least thats what Mark thinks about his big brother, until du Pont proves him wrong. At heart, Foxcatcher is about Marks disillusionment, after entering a world much bigger than any hed imagined, at seeing it shrink his brother. Its about Daves tragically false belief that when he sells himself, he does it mostly to help Mark, with only a manageable degree of compromise; and its about the not-so-secretly vicious rage of du Pont at failing to demonstrate, at all times and in every way, the superiority he feels ought to have been his birthright.
Probably the best moment in du Ponts life, according to Foxcatcher, comes when he walks Mark Schultz into the gym hes built on the estate, and Mark, awed and excited, instinctively throws himself into a warm-up. He steps forward suddenly while dropping to one knee. Its the first time that Mark seems to bow before du Pont; but the match, with its many falls, is just beginning.

One of the many pleasures of Gabe Polskys bright and bouncy documentary Red Army, about the fortunes of the Soviet Unions premier hockey team and its players, is the casual disregard shown to the eager filmmaker by the central figure and principal interview subject, Slava Fetisov, who was for nine years the captain of the Soviet national team. As the graphics explain, cascading down one side of the screen and then, having run out of space, spilling down the other, you are looking at a man who won two Olympic gold medals, two Stanley Cups, seven world championships, fourteen Soviet championships and the Order of Lenin, as well as having an asteroid named for him. Now handsome, well-tailored and prosperous-looking in middle age, Fetisov is not someone who feels the need to interrupt a cellphone call just because Polsky is waiting with the camera running. To a meek offscreen plea to begin the interview, he gives no more attention than is needed to flip the finger.

As you soon learn from Red Army, there is much more behind this superb indifference than the complacency of a winner. Fetisov was born into the poverty and ruins of the Soviet Union after the Great Patriotic Wara setting called up through Polskys ample and fascinating use of archival footageand fought his way as a child into the national hockey training program using equipment that his parents had bought on the black market with 250 painfully saved rubles. Trained by the brilliant, creative and fatherly coach Anatoli Tarasov, then later abused by Tarasovs KGB-affiliated replacement, who kept the squad locked in camp for eleven months out of the year, Fetisov and his teammates were required to be more than just athletes: they were living proof of the superiority of the Soviet system. If they fell short, there were consequences. And when a crumbling Soviet Union needed hard currency, they were available to be indentured, one by one, to the National Hockey League. Only Fetisov refused. He held out in dire circumstances, enduring harassment, beating and a face-off with the minister of defense, until he won a visathe first grantedthat allowed him to play in the United States without kicking back most of his salary.
And then the struggle continuedbecause in the individualistic culture of the NHL, there was none of the teamwork that Fetisov was used to, and none of the artistry, but only set plays and fistfights. Apparently, there really had been some superior aspects to the Soviet system, and now he was shut out of them.
A thematically ambitious film with a genial and even joking manner, Red Army usually keeps the mood light, with animations of Soviet-era posters, shots of colorful (and purely imaginary) trading cards of Red Army players, and soundtrack music that might have suited Danny Kaye in his Slavic mode. True to the tradition of sport documentaries, its structured to be the story of a triumph, featuring a main character who has the swagger of not just a survivor but a victor. Polsky knows enough to send you out of the theater with a smile, won at his own expense if necessary. But he also knows there are implications to this tale that go beyond the sport, and nuances that are absent from clichs about Soviet life. Like the high-speed weaving and passing of the Red Army team, his movie is fun to watch, but actually very complicated.

In the competition to be mentioned as an Oscar contender, the fine young English actor Eddie Redmayne is currently vying with Steve Carell in the based-on-a-true-story and hidden-by-makeup category for his role as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. You might think that Felicity Jones would attract just as much attention in the part of Jane Hawking, given that the film is about the Hawkings marriage first and science only second. Jane must be an extraordinary woman to have devoted herself to Stephen for so many years, having known about his illness from the start. As it happens, though, the role is so underwritten that you might think the screenplay was credited to MetLife. Youre left only with the wig on Redmaynes head, the big eyeglasses, the tortured-genius mannerisms (My Two Left Feet, they should call this one) and James Marshs direction, which takes the easy solution to every scene. Its a creative innovation, I suppose: frictionless filmmaking for a movie about physics.
If you want a real step into the intellectual void, though, youd better save yourself for Interstellar, Christopher Nolans latest exercise in devising narrative lines that run laboriously in different locations and on multiple timescales to no great effect, other than to tell you that love will find a way. Matthew McConaughey, asked to use little of the depth, power and wit he brought to Dallas Buyers Club, defaults to Gary Cooper manliness as a corn farmer in a dystopian future. The character is even called Coop; and like that slim, laconic hero, he does what he has to do, piloting a strangely blissed-out Anne Hathaway through a black hole in search of a new home for humanity. Left behind is his young daughter, whose plush lips tell you she will grow up to be Jessica Chastain.
Nolan intends to wow you with sheer magnitudeInterstellar heaps up mountainous dust storms, mountainous waves, mountains of icebut his small thinking can be summed up in Coops onboard robot companion, called TARS. It looks something like the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey, only its shorter than Coop, sometimes walks around like a metallic Tinkertoy and tells corny jokes. In Kubrick, humans carried their convention-bound minds into an indifferent grandeur. In Nolan, the symbol of that grandeur has been brought inside and domesticatedand like the movie, it goes clunk, clunk, clunk.

The Nation,L,"In Egypts Growing Insurgency, Civilians Pay the Highest Price | The Nation","

Destroyed homes on a street in the northern Sinai city of Rafah after an Egyptian military operation. (Reuters/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa)


As the acquittal of ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak makes local and international headlines, little attention is being paid to another corner of the countryNorth Sinai, where the civilian population finds itself caught in the crossfire of a growing conflict.
Life in the region is now defined by curfews, checkpoints, house raids and arbitrary arrests. No one is allowed out after dark. Telephone service is intermittent and gas is scarce. The local economy has ground to a halt. Tanks and heavy armor are deployed in the streets, while helicopter gunships clatter overhead. The army has razed hundreds of homes. Ambulances and teachers have been shot at by security forces, while militants have beheaded suspected collaborators.
A low-level insurgency brewing in the restive northeastern corner of the peninsula that began to ramp up following the July 2013 ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi has been met with a heavy-handed assault by the Egyptian military, escalating the internecine conflict to unprecedented levels.
An attack on an army checkpoint in October killed more than thirty soldiers, the highest death toll among military personnel in recent memory. Sinais most active militant group, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem), claimed responsibility in a slick thirty-minute video that included grisly footage of the attack. The group has also publicly pledged allegiance to Islamic State, the militant group that has seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi responded by declaring a three-month state of emergency in the north and center of Sinai, implementing a strict curfew from 5 pm to 7 am and vastly expanding the jurisdiction of military courts.
The army quickly announced plans to create a buffer zone in Rafah, a town bordering the Gaza Strip, to root out militants and eradicate smuggling tunnels across the frontier. With little warning, the military began destroying hundreds of houses, displacing more than a thousand families in a security zone that stretches 500 meters from the border. The decision received the blessing of the United Statesfor decades the Egyptian militarys prime benefactorwith State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki stressing that Washington is continuing to support [Egypts] efforts to take steps to defend their borders. Three weeks later, Egyptian officials declared that the size of the buffer zone would be doubled, to one kilometer, essentially covering most of Rafah.
The people of Rafah are being forced out. They dont want to leave, says Abu Ahmed, a resident of Rafah who lives just beyond the one-kilometer security zone. Im calling on the army to stop this injustice.
The North Sinai governor, Abdel Fattah Harhour, said in late November that all 802 houses in the first 500-meter area have been demolished and that compensation was paid to 290 families.
Even if they were paid millions, these people didnt want to leave. Who would ever want to leave his home? Abu Ahmed asks. Many of the displaced have gone to stay with relatives or neighbors in Rafah outside the buffer zone. Others moved to al-Arish, the provincial capital, or as far as Cairo and the Nile Delta. 
The use of curfews, forced evictions and house demolitions echoed the tactics frequently adopted by the Israeli military against Palestinians in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, Amnesty International criticized the governments actions as flouting both national and international law. In their bid to wipe out the threat posed by armed groups in Sinai, Egypts authorities have entirely disregarded their duties toward residents in the area, said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty Internationals deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, in a statement.
Rafah has indeed been devastated by the military operation. The force of the demolitions has damaged many dwellings in the area. Electricity cuts are frequent, gas stations have been shut down and there is no running water.
The army has arrested many people in random sweeps. People have been taken from their homes and tortured and their houses were burnt, Abu Ahmed says. The Egyptian government should allow reporters to come and discover the truth, to see what is happening here.
In late November, ten members of one family, including children, were killed when their home was blown up. Security officials claimed insurgent mortars hit the house, but conflicting accounts pointed to an army air strike. The competing accounts are difficult to verify.
Authorities have mostly barred independent journalists from entering North Sinai, though army announcements of operational successes make headline news in state and private media. Over one four-day period, November 20-23, the military claimed it had killed twenty-eight terrorists, arrested eighty-five, and destroyed 246 hideouts, 207 motorcycles and forty-six other vehicles used by militants. Not to be outdone, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis issued a statement on November 30 claiming to have carried out more than ten attacks in the previous month, including blowing up six army and police armored vehicles, killing seven police officers and conscripts and demolishing the house of a man accused of being a spy for the army. Ansar also claimed responsibility for the killing of an American oil worker, publishing pictures of his passport and two identification cards on its official Twitter account.

Meanwhile, the toll on civilians across North Sinai goes largely unreported.
Interviews with local residents paint a grim picture of life in the region. Many reached by phone were too afraid to talk, even anonymously. Those who did agree to speak refused to give their full names.
Daily routine is controlled by the curfew. As the 5 pm deadline approaches, people scramble to get off the streets and return to their houses. Its like the last hour before Iftar in Ramadan with everyone rushing home, says Muhamed, a resident of al-Arish, referring to the sunset meal that breaks the fast during the Muslim holy month. 
At 5 pm police deployed in the streets begin shooting heavily in the airthe signal that curfew has begun. Anyone outside between then and 7 am risks being shot or arrested and faces up to three months in prison.
During daytime hours, while the curfew is lifted, telephone networks are shut down, aggravating simple acts of communication and daily chores. After dark, with the streets cleared, cell phones work once again, but only intermittently.
The curfew is exclusionaryyou are cut off, says Hussein, a resident of al-Arish. You dont know whats happening around you. You cant go outside, and its hard to make calls. Freedom of movement is a human right, and we dont have it anymore.
The curfew has severely affected local businesses, with many cafes, restaurants and shops relying on evening customers forced to close. Those affected by the curfew are not the militants or terrorists; its the ordinary citizenhis income, his daily bread, his safety, Hussein adds.
The army and police checkpoints that dot the roads also pose a threat to ordinary citizens.
On November 17, army soldiers manning a roadblock near a museum in al-Arish fired warning shots at an approaching busload of schoolteachers just minutes before the 5 pm curfew, according to Ahmed, one of the teachers on board. They started firing in the air and a bullet hit one teacher in the leg, he says. The school bus was late reaching its destination because it had been held up for hours at an earlier checkpoint.
The next day, teachers at several schools refused to go to work and staged a protest outside the headquarters of the North Sinai provincial government in al-Arish. We are shot at every day, says one teacher through tears in an interview at the demonstration broadcast on a local TV channel. She describes an arduous daily journey to and from her school. 
There are shots fired, there are explosions, and we feel all of this, says another teacher. The children are terrified. Of course this is not a suitable climate for schooling. Others complained of being stopped and interrogated by militants at roadblocks who suspect them of belonging to the army or police.
North Sinai Governor Harhour responded the following day by indefinitely shutting down all schools in the border towns of Sheikh Zuweid and Rafah.

Access to medical care after dark is also severely restricted, and sick residents often find themselves stranded in their homes. Locals who need to see a doctor after curfew must call for an ambulance to take them to the hospital. Medical workers first have to coordinate directly with security forces to get permission to go out.
It can take two or three hours, or even until the next morning, says Dr. Mahmoud Amer, the head of the Ambulance Authority in North Sinai. Ambulances also act as a curfew car service, returning patients home from the hospital, which has increased their workload fourfold.
Despite efforts to coordinate their movements, many ambulance drivers have come under fire from army and police at checkpoints, according to Amer. Medical workers have also been detained by militants at roadblocks, who threaten to kill them for any association with the security forces. The danger to us is from everyonefrom the army and police, and from jihadists, he says.
The Sisi government continues to take draconian steps, pouring military resources into the region in an effort to quell the insurgency. Yet it is the residents of North Sinai towns and villages that have borne the brunt of the fighting.
What are the byproducts of this very heavy-handed approach? asks Michael Wahid Hanna, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. Theres a real, obvious concern based on past practice that this, at the end of the day, is not going to contain the militancy but perhaps accelerate it.

The Nation,L,Darren Wilson: Americas Model Policeman | The Nation,"

Darren Wilson at the hospital following the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown (St. Louis County Attorney's Office)


Truth is stranger than fiction; it is also most certainly harder to accept.
In a nearly hour-long interview with ABCs George Stephanopoulos on Tuesday, a day after thousands of protesters took to the streets from coast to coast, expressing outrage that yet another white police officer got away with the murder of another unarmed black person, Wilson stuck to his story: I just did my job. I did what I was paid to do. I followed my training. Thats it.
Sure, there are plenty of reasons to doubt his account. If he knew Michael Brown was a robbery suspect, why did he politely stop him and Dorian Johnson for jaywalking only to have a conversation, as he described to Stephanopoulos? If the West Florissant section of Ferguson is really a great community, why did he testify that it was a not very well-liked community and a hotbed of anti-police sentiment?
And yet, despite all the equivocations, the shooting death of the teenager on August 9 and Mondays grand jury decision not to indict Wilson were entirely unsurprising. They are the predictable outcomes of a criminal justice system doing exactly what it was meant to do. For all the dissecting and debating of the veracity of Darren Wilsons grand jury testimony this week, one thing seems crystal clear. He was in fact doing his job.
Indeed, by this standard, isnt Darren Wilson actually a model police officer?
He certainly thinks so. When asked by Stephanopoulos if he could make something good come of this experience, he said he would love to teach people and give them more insight in uses of force. That he may have logged more time on first-person shootersemptying clip after clip to take down demonic super-villains who run through shotsthan actual police work is beside the point. Darren Wilson has the kind of experience that many Americans value.
Evidence abounds that the United States is the worlds most punitive nation. More people are behind bars and incarcerated at higher per capita rates here than anywhere in the world. African-Americans are the nations prime suspects and prisoners. White police officers are our chosen protectors, enforcing the law in the name of public safety.
In a Pew research poll conducted shortly after Ferguson made national headlines this summer, researchers found that most Americans have a fair amount of confidence in local police. Eighty-five percent of respondents, white and black, gave a fair to excellent rating on police protecting people from crime. And on using the right amount of force, 66 percent of respondents gave a fair to excellent rating; white support stood at 73 percent and blacks at 42 percent. Though a clear racial divide exists, African-Americans are only 13 percent of the population nationally. Everyone is therefore implicated in police performance writ large, if not by choice, certainly through political representatives.
Critics and protesters of police violence among African-Americans and on the political left, as polling data suggests, see things differently. They are organizing against the routine killing of unarmed men and beating of helpless women on an unprecedented scale not seen since the anti-lynching movement of the last century. Even with such evidence in hand that black men are twenty-one times as likely to be killed by law enforcement than white men, as analyzed in a recent report by ProPublica, todays movement like the one before it might fail to overcome deeply entrenched fears of black criminality without a massive shift in white public opinion and a new model for law enforcement.
Most whites do not realize they are reading from very old racial scripts. When Ida B. Wells, the worlds leading anti-lynching activist and black social worker of the early twentieth century, tried to explain to a wealthy suffragist in Chicago that anti-black violence in the nation must end, Mary Plummer replied: blacks need to drive the criminals out of the community. Have you forgotten that 10 percent of all the crimes that were committed in Chicago last year were by colored men [less than 3 percent of the population]?
Like Mary Plummer, Darren Wilson is emphatic that the issue is not racism. Browns African-American neighborhood is one of our high-crime areas for the city, he said during the interview. You cant perform the duties of a police officer and have racism in you. I help people. Thats my job. On that day, the only emotion I ever felt was fear, before my training took over. We are taught to deal with the threat at hand.
Implicit bias research tells us that most Americans are afraid of black people and subconsciously associate dangerous weapons and animals with them. They see things often that are not there. Stanford psychologists Rebecca Haley and Jennifer Eberhardt note in a study last month that the more people perceive blacks as criminals or prisoners, the more people fear crime, which then increases their acceptance of punitive policies.
The truth is that Wilson has no regrets. He wouldnt do things differently. Hes looking forward to a new chapter in his professional journey as a teacher, trainer or a consultant. Hes our representative figurea model policemanacting on our collective fears.

The Nation,L,"The UN Backs Down a Little, Adds More Women to Its Peacekeeping Panel | The Nation","

The United Nations (Flickr/Ashitaka San)


In an act of contrition almost never seen at the United Nations, in early November Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon acknowledged that the organization had made a mistake in naming a gender-lopsided panel to review its peacekeeping operations. The fourteen-member High-level Independent Panel on UN Peace Operations originally included only three women.
The announcement sparked outrage among advocates for women, made worse by the fact that the panels members were announced on the fourteenth anniversary of the first Security Council resolution demanding gender parity in all aspects of peace operations.
Besieged by the media, a spokesperson for the secretary-general read a groveling (for the UN) statement at the organizations daily briefing. We try as hard as we can to get the right gender balance and the right regional balance for these very large panels and sometimes its a question of availability, the spokesperson said. But when we make a mistake on that, youre absolutely right, thats a low number and well have to do better.
Caving to outside pressure, on Monday Ki-moon tried again, announcing a reformed panel with better balance, but still well short of gender parity: the reconstituted panel now has three additional women, doubling the total to six, along with eleven men. A woman, Ameerah Haq of Bangladesh, who has been the UNs under secretary-general for peacekeeping field support, was elevated to vice chair.
For those who follow the workings of the UN closely, there is hope that this marks a changehowever insufficient in critics eyesin the organizations persistent practice of making important appointments behind the scenes with governments pushing their candidates.
Critics will be watching to see if public pressure will be similarly successful in making the selection of the next secretary-general transparent rather than the result of the usual horse-trading that goes on in secret among governments. That battle of nations and regions wont take place until later next year or early 2016, but more voices are being heard internationally calling for a genuine contest that is more open to public view this time.

The new peacekeeping-review panel will be chaired by Jos Ramos-Horta, a former Timorese diplomat and president who is also co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize for peace. Ramos-Horta, a surprise choice to many, has minimal experience with UN peacekeeping. His vice chair, Haq, has nearly four decades of work in peacekeeping missions in Laos, Sudan, Afghanistan and Timor Leste. Other women on the panel are also veterans of work in conflict, human rights, violence against women and other relevant fields, refuting the hollow complaint that women cant be found for high-level jobs in what many still consider a male domain like peacekeeping.
Apart from Haq, the women now on the panel include Marie-Louise Baricako of Burundi, executive director of Femmes Africa Solidarit; Radhika Coomaraswamy, a leading human-rights lawyer from Sri Lanka and UN specialist on children in conflict and violence against women; Hilde F. Johnson of Norway, who negotiated peace in South Sudan; Joy Abena Nyarko Mensa-Bonsu, a Ghanaian law professor who worked for the UN on the rule of law in Liberia; and Rima Salah, a career Unicef official from Jordan.
Nongovernmental organizations as well as some UN officials have asked how Secretary-General Ban could have put himself in this inexplicably bad position after his many pronouncements on the importance of raising the status of women worldwide. The head of UN peacekeeping, Under Secretary-General Herv Ladsous of France, whose advice was sought in the composition of the panel, strongly recommended a woman as chair and a far larger proportion of women as panel experts.
Anwarul Chowdhury, a diplomat and later UN official from Bangladesh who was the leading proponent in 2000 of Security Council Resolution 1325the first resolution on equality for women in peacekeeping and post-conflictis not very impressed with the revised panel.
A woman should have been made the co-chair and not the vice-chair of the peace panel, he wrote in an e-mail soliciting his reaction. A key objective of UN Security Councils history-making resolution 1325 on women, peace and security is to achieve womens equality of participation at all decision making levels. Womens eternal uphill struggle for equality becomes more frustrating when civil society has to remind the UN to stop dragging its feet in ensuring equality at all levels so that the humanity benefits as a whole.
It is significant that the anger that greeted the latest attempt to sideline women forced Ban to rethink his too-easy acceptance of a lopsided panel, which was apparently chosen largely by Ramos-Horta. Among the leaders of a relentless campaign to have the panel reconstituted were Stephen Lewis, a former Canadian ambassador to the UN and deputy executive director of Unicef, and Paula Donovan, an Africa specialist and co-director with Lewis of AIDS-Free World, an organization which has become a strong advocate for women. In several sharp letters to Ban and video commentaries, Lewis and Donovan excoriated the secretary-general. They still arent satisfied.
An 11-man, 6-woman panel, with a man as chair and a woman as vice chair, does not bring gender balance by anyones reckoning, they wrote in a statement. The Secretary-General said that he must do better. The worlds women will hold him to account.

The Nation,L,4 Reasons Keystone Really Matters | The Nation,"

Demonstrators protest against the Keystone XL pipeline in Washington, DC. (Creative Commons/Duffernutter Photography)


It doesnt matter.
Ever since the debate over the Keystone XL pipeline exploded three and half years ago, thats been the argument from the projects liberal supporters. Sure, the oil that Keystone would carry from the Alberta tar sands is three to four times more greenhouse-gas-intensive than conventional crude. But thats not on Keystone XL, were told. Why? Because if TransCanada isnt able to build Keystone to the south, then another pipeline will be built to the west or east. Or that dirty oil will be transported by rail. But make no mistake, we have long been assured: all that carbon buried beneath Albertas boreal forest will be mined no matter what the president decides.
Up until quite recently, the tar-sands boom did seem pretty unstoppable. The industry regularly projected that production would soon double, then triple, and foreign investors raced to build massive new mines. But these days, panic is in the air in formerly swaggering Calgary. In less than a year, Shell, Statoil and the French company Total have all shelved major new tar-sands projects. And a rather large question mark is suddenly hanging over one of the worlds largestand dirtiestcarbon deposits.
This radically changes the calculation confronting Barack Obama. His decision is no longer about one pipeline. Its about whether the US government will throw a lifeline to a climate-destabilizing industrial project that is under a confluence of pressures that add up to a very real crisis. Here are the four main reasons that the tar sands are in deep trouble.
1. Oil prices are low. In mid-November, oil prices dipped to levels not seen since 2010. Ahead of the recent G-20 summit, Vladimir Putin spoke of preparing for further catastrophic drops. This matters nowhere more than in the tar sands, where the semisolid bitumen is hugely expensive to extract; the sector really started booming when it looked like $100-a-barrel was the new normal. Prices may well rebound, but the dip has been a vivid reminder of the inherent risk in betting big on such a high-cost extraction method.
2. Tar-sands pipelines are protest magnets. Supporters of Keystone frequently claim that if the oil doesnt go south through the United States, it will simply be piped west, through British Columbia, and make it onto tankers that way. They might want to pay closer attention to what is going on west of the Rockies. Since November 20, more than sixty people have been arrested outside of Vancouver as they attempted to block the expansion of a tar-sands pipeline owned by Kinder Morgan. Further north, Enbridges proposed Northern Gateway pipeline, another would-be tar-sands escape route, is even more widely rejected. Indeed, opposition to increased tanker traffic along their beloved coastline has united British Columbians.
So what about east? Well, on November 21, the premiers of Ontario and Quebec signed a joint agreement that erected a series of obstacles to TransCanadas proposed Energy East pipeline, which, if completed, would carry tar-sands oil to the East Coast. The move came in response to strong opposition to the project in both provinces.
Some members of the it doesnt matter camp point out that tar-sands oil is getting out anyway through the existing infrastructure. This completely misses the point that Keystone XL has always been linked to plans to greatly expand the amount of heavy oil being extracted. And the capacity to transport that oil isnt there, which is why, when Statoil nixed its mine (reportedly worth $2 billion), it cited limited pipeline access among its reasons.
3. Indigenous rights keep winning in court. Adding more uncertainty is the fact that all these projects impact land to which First Nations people have title and treaty rightsrights that have been repeatedly upheld by Canadas Supreme Court. Most recently, in June, the high court ruled unanimously that development couldnt happen on the lands of the Tsilhqotin First Nation in BC without seeking their consent. The pipeline companies do not have First Nations consenton the contrary, dozens of indigenous communities have vigorously asserted their opposition. Canadian courts are already jammed with pipeline challenges, including nearly a dozen targeting Northern Gateway alone.
4. Climate action is back. Yes, the targets in the US-China deal are wholly inadequate, and so are the sums pledged to developing countries for climate financing. But there can be no doubt that climate change has landed back on the world stage in a way not seen since the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009.

Thats another strike against unchecked tar-sands expansion, because those mines are the main reason behind Canadas status as the worlds foremost climate criminal, with emissions nearly 30 percent higher than they should be under the Kyoto Protocol. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper got away with laughing off his countrys international commitments when other governments were doing the same. But now that the United States, China and the European Union are at least making a show of taking the climate crisis seriously, Canadas defiance is looking distinctly rogue.
It is in this rapidly changing context that Barack Obama must make his final determination on Keystone. A jittery market is looking to him for a signalnot just about this one project, but about the much larger and consequential one at the mouth of that pipe. Are the tar sands a long-term business prospect, a safe haven in which to sink hundreds of billions of dollars for decades to come? Or was the whole idea of flaying a huge, beautiful swath of this continent to exploit an energy source that is guaranteed to help cook the planet merely a brief follya bad dream from which we all must awake? All eyes are on the president. Yes or no?
Either way, Keystone matters.

The Nation,L,Why Its Impossible to Indict a Cop | The Nation,"

Riot police in Ferguson, Missouri (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)


How to police the police is a question as old as civilization, now given special urgency by a St. Louis County grand jurys return of a no bill of indictment for Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson in his fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown. The result is shocking to many, depressingly predictable to more than a few.
Can the cops be controlled? Its never been easy: according to one old sociological chestnut, the monopoly on the legitimate use of violence is what defines modern government, and this monopoly is jealously protected against the second-guessing of puny civilians. All over the country, the issue of restraining police power is framed around the retribution against individual cops, from Staten Island to Milwaukee to Los Angeles. But is this the best way to impose discipline on law enforcement and roll back what even Republican appellate court appointees are calling rampant criminalization?
Police shootings in America
First, the big picture. Last year, the FBI tallied 461 justifiable homicides committed by law enforcementjustifiable because the Bureau assumes so, and the nations courts have not found otherwise. This is the highest number in two decades, even as the nations overall homicide rate continues to drop. Homicides committed by on-duty law enforcement make up 3 percent of the 14,196 homicides committed in the United States in 2013. A USA Today analysis of the FBI database found an average of about ninety-six police homicides a year in which a white officer kills a black person.
The FBIs police homicide stats are fuzzy, and they are surely an undercount, given that they come from voluntary reports to the FBI from police departments all over the country. That the federal government does not keep a strict national tally shows just how seriously it takes this problem. A crowdsourced database has sprung up to fill the gap, as has a wiki-tabulation.
Perhaps the most disturbing thing about these police killings, many of them of unarmed victims, is that our courts find them perfectly legal.
SCOTUS and the license to kill
Chapter 563 of the Missouri Revised Statutes grants a lot of discretion to officers of the law to wield deadly force, to the horror of many observers swooping in to the Ferguson story. The statute authorizes deadly force in effecting an arrest or in preventing an escape from custody if the officer reasonably believes it is necessary in order to to effect the arrest and also reasonably believes that the person to be arrested has committed or attempted to commit a felonyor may otherwise endanger life or inflict serious physical injury unless arrested without delay.
But this law is not an outlier, and is fully in sync with Supreme Court jurisprudence. The legal standard authorizing deadly force is something called objective reasonableness.
This standard originates in the 1985 case of Tennessee v. Garner, which appeared at first to tighten restrictions on the police use of deadly force. The case involved a Memphis cop, Elton Hymon, who shot dead one Edward Garner: 15 years old, black and unarmed. Garner had just burgled a house, grabbing a ring and ten bucks. The US Supreme Court ruled that a police officer, henceforth, could use deadly force only if he has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. The ruling required that the use of force be objectively reasonable. How this reasonableness should be determined was established in a 1989 case, Graham v. Connor: severity of the crime, whether the suspect is resisting or trying to escape and above all, whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others. All this appeared to restrict police violenceeven if, in the end, Officer Hymon was never criminally charged for fatally shooting Edward Garner.
Objectively reasonablewhat could be wrong with that? But in actual courtroom practice, objective reasonableness has become nearly impossible to tell apart from the subjective snap judgments of panic-fueled police officers. American courts universally defer to the law enforcement officers own personal assessment of the threat at the time.
The Graham analysis essentially prohibits any second-guessing of the officers decision to use deadly force: no hindsight is permitted, and wide latitude is granted to the officers account of the situation, even if scientific evidence proves it to be mistaken. Such was the case of Berkeley, Missouri, police officers Robert Piekutowski and Keith Kierzkowski, who in 2000 fatally shot Earl Murray and Ronald Beasley out of fear that the victims car was rolling towards them. Forensic investigations established that the car had not in fact lurched towards the officers at the time of the shootingbut this was still not enough for the St. Louis County grand jury to indict the two cops of anything.
Not surprisingly then, legal experts find that there is built-in leeway for police, and the very breadth of this leeway is why criminal charges against police are so rare, says Walter Katz, a police oversight lawyer who served on the Los Angeles County Office of Independent Review until it disbanded in July of this year. According to Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine Law School, recent Supreme Court decisions are not a path towards justice but rather a series of obstacles to holding police accountable for civil rights violations.
An officers personal threat assessment is often bolstered by the fact that there are between 270 million and 310 million guns in the United States. Take a grand jurys failure to indict the police officers who fatally shot John Crawford III, the black man holding a BB gun in a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio. In a country where shooting sprees are a regular occurrence, where guns are widely available at Walmart and where fake guns that look very similar to real guns are sold in the same store, the police officers fears were deemed reasonable enough for the grand jury to find no probable cause of criminal wrongdoing. That is how the Supreme Court police violence jurisprudence works, and it was firmly on the side of officer Sean Williams, just as it has now been found to be on Darren Wilsons. Given the deference and latitude hardwired into the law, there is just an underlying assumption that the officer did not engage in criminal activity, says Katz.
The first step to controlling the police is to get rid of the fantasy, once and for all, that the law is on our side. The law is firmly on the side of police who open fire on unarmed civilians.
The sick joke of self-regulation
The lethal use of police force typically sets off an internal police investigation to determine if departmental regulations were violated. The regs and the law are not the same thing. Case in point: the chokehold that NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo used to strangle Eric Garner, suspected of selling loose cigarettes, on Staten Island last July. (The grand jury bill on that case has still not been decided.) The chokehold is not prohibited by law, but it is by departmental rules. The violation might earn a departmental censure of some kind, from loss of vacation days to getting fired, but they tend to be radically mild, when not nonexistent.
What about internal affairs investigations? On television they are aggressive, dogged, uncompromising. In real life they tend to insulate the police from serious external sanction. I stopped cooperating with the IAB ten years ago, says Jason Leventhal, a former assistant district attorney in Richmond County, Staten Island who now works as a civil rights litigator, often suing the police. IA will never, ever credit the claim of police abuse. They hide witnesses, they push witnesses around. The only time I cooperate with them is when I know I have their hands tied behind their back.
Are there any effective civilian oversight systems at any major police department in the US? Nobody I interviewed for this article could name one. New Yorks Civilian Complaint Review Board occasionally docks vacation days from police officers but the board has no real teeth. Even staffers at the New York Civil Liberties Union have candidly told me that its more or less worthless. I dont have any faith in the CCRB or the Internal Affairs Bureau or any other internal mechanism, says Ron Kuby, a civil rights and criminal defense lawyer in New York. Civilian complaints rarely even get in the way of an individual officers career. In New York, CCRB complaints dont even go in a police officers file, says Kuby. The PBA just says that the more aggressive officers will get excessive force complaints.
Firing a police officer with a record of abusive behavior (or worse) is often extremely difficult and can carry a heavy political cost. Patrolmen Benevolent Associations, which have escaped the kind of resentment directed at other public-sector unions, tend to be powerful players in local politics able to inflict pain on any politico who would cross them. (Remember when Sarah Palin struggled to fire a state trooper and ex-brother-in-law who had allegedly acted like a thug towards her sister?)
The reality is, it is extremely difficult to get law enforcement to police itself, and self-regulation is here, just as it is in poultry processing or coal mining, a sick joke.
Civil suits
Civil suits for monetary damages require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, but these suits are not a slam-dunk for victims of cop violence, either. The same jurisprudence that grants wide leeway to law enforcement still holds. Last March, one victims family lost a federal civil suit for wrongful death and civil rights violations brought against police officer Nicholas Bennallack for fatally shooting a fleeing and unarmed drug suspect. The jury believed the cops claim that he opened fire out of fear for his life.
What about all the times when excessive force suits get settled out of court? It turns out that massive payouts dont deter police misconduct for one straightforward reason: neither individual officers nor police departments are responsible for coughing up the cash. The union covers the officers lawyer, and research from Joanna Schwartz of UCLA Law School found that governments, not individual officers, paid out 99.98 percent of the damages. Settlements and damages arent paid by the police department, whose budget will waltz by untouched, but typically out of the general municipal budget.
Kuby maintains that civil remedies will always fall short and thinks only criminal prosecution has a prayer of changing police behavior. Prosecution works well with people who are not fundamentally criminal and have enough stake in the system to respond! Any response below that is an insult. But he admits that the political will to make the criminal justice system restrain and regulate its own members and enforcers is consistently lackingand has been as long as hes been practicing law.
Dont make a federal case out of it.
Occasionally the federal Department of Justice intervenes to prosecute individual cops for depriving a victim of his or her civil rights. If a state-level prosecution fails to secure a conviction, this can give the government a second chance to prosecute on different charges. Rodney Kings LAPD assailants were convicted in 1993 in just this way.
But the feds, like other prosecutors, only like to take on cases they can win, says Alan Vinegrad, who was part of the federal attorneys that prosecuted the NYPD officer who in 1997 sexually tortured Abner Louima with a broken-off broom handle. In the Louima case it was painfully obvious that the use of force was extreme and willful, says Vinegrad. But in other cases, if the officer is acting more in the line of duty, a federal civil rights violation is a tougher thing to show.
Will the Obama DOJ take on the Michael Brown case? It doesnt look like it. Eyewitness testimony is conflicting, and so far the multiple forensic reports that have come out are not inconsistent with Darren Wilsons version of the shootingwhich would make the federal standard of willful misconduct difficult to prove. The Obama DOJ has signaled with leaks that it is backing away from a federal case against the officer.
Far more useful are the DOJ Civil Rights Divisions root-and-branch interventions into violently dysfunctional police forces, triggered by patterns and practices of systematic rights violations rather than any one particular incident. For instance, the DOJ just launched a major effort to reorganize and reshape the police department of Albuquerque, reforming its trainings, protocols and appallingly trigger-happy habits. (The Albuquerque police have shot thirty-seven people in the past four years, twenty-three of them fatally.) This is a well-established tool of the federal government: other police departments under federal supervision include those of Seattle, New Orleans, Puerto Rico and, until recently, Los Angeles and Detroit; the feds also nearly took over wholesale the Oakland police department in 2012. But note that these federal interventions do not entail punishments, civil or criminal, of individual police officers.
In the unusual instances when a law enforcement officer is convicted, the penalties tend to be remarkably light. Johannes Mehserle, the Bay Area Rapid Transit officer who shot the unarmed Oscar Grant III dead on New Years Day, 2009, served eleven months of a two-year sentence for involuntary manslaughter. Then there is Jon Burge, the Chicago police detective who led the torture of over 100 (mostly black) suspects, released last month after serving four and a half years in custody. (The statute of limitations had passed for the more serious offenses.) Burge still collects a $54,000 departmental pension.
Such Scandinavian-style lenity is quite different from the mind-numbing severity of sentences inflicted on non-cops. Consider the sixty years that potentially face Marissa Alexander for firing a warning shot at an abusive ex. Or the life sentences without possibility of parole that more than 3,000 Americans are serving for nonviolent crimes.
Video
Some observers see hope for police reform in the ubiquity of smartphone video recorders. Its true that the ever-growing supply of police misconduct videos fuels the anger needed to sustain reform efforts, and even occasionally leads to police officers being disciplined or prosecuted. Examples include NYPD officers David Afanador and Tyrane Isaac, caught on camera pistol-whipping a teenage suspect last August, or South Carolina state trooper Sean Groubert who in September opened fire on a motorist heading into his truck to retrieve his drivers license. Jason Leventhal told me he expects an indictment of the Staten Island police officer who strangled Eric Garner because the video evidence, caught on a cellphone, was so brutal. It would certainly be a good thing if police departments invested less in military gear like M-RAP armored vehicles and more in dashcams and GoPro cameras; with the right department protocols and practices, these cameras strengthen police accountability.
But just as often these videos end up illustrating just how much leeway police have in opening fire on a suspect. Take the police shooting of St. Louis resident Kajieme Powell, a mentally ill man allegedly holding a knife, a fatal shooting arguably less defensible than the Michael Brown shooting ten days before, and caught on a cell-phone video. Or, again, John Crawford III, whose slaying by police officers was caught on the Walmart security cameras. Or the July, 2012 video of eight members of the Saginaw, Michigan, police department, six of them firing forty-six shots at Milton Hall, a mentally ill homeless man, hitting him eleven times, after he took out a pocket knife when a police dog started to lunge at him. Although the latter horrific video picked up a fresh wave of publicity when screened at a hearing of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, DC, last month, such videos cannot undo the legally enshrined deference to the subjective feelings of police officers when they reach for their weapons. No criminal charges were even attempted by state prosecutors in any of these cases; the DOJ has announced it is looking into the Crawford shooting, but declined to prosecute in the other two.
(A note on the IACHR and other international forums: bringing these cases of police shootings to them is a canny way to generate publicity and raise consciousness, but no one should ever imagine for even a second that such bodies will ever wield any actual power in American courts.)
There really is no courtroom miracle or lawsuit solution, no matter how clever the litigator, no matter how deep-dish the foundation grant, that is going to discipline the police and break them of their trigger-happy habits.
Thinking big
Police shootings are only one function of living in one of the most heavily policed societies in the world. Any movement to roll back this creeping overcriminalization is going to have to look beyond criminal prosecutions of individual police and take in the big picture.
The militarized police response to the mostly nonviolent demonstrations in Ferguson and elsewhere has appalled not only progressives but many conservatives as well. The armys provision of of weapons surplus, from MRAPs to tanks, to local police departments under the federal 1033 Program, ought to be easy to end. But departments are reluctant to give back new toys, and majorities of both the congressional Progressive Caucus and the Black Caucus voted against a bill that would have stopped the disbursement of some military goodies to local police departments. Gun control advocates would do well to lobby hard and publicly for arms control measures applied to the police as wellundisciplined but up-armored cops are part of what that drives many otherwise sane private citizens to build private armories.
Wanton overpolicing had poisoned relations between the people and their government well before Darren Wilson shot dead Michael Brown. Less mediagenic than police militarization and far more insidious is law enforcements daily harassment of citizens for petty offenses. The local government in Ferguson has been treating its residents and neighbors less like free people with rights than like revenue milk-cows to be exploited to the max. Citations and fines for petty offenses are profligately inflicted on residents, particularly black residents. According to a blockbuster report issued by St. Louiss ArchCity Defenders advocacy group, over 20 percent of city revenue comes from municipal courts (making them the citys second-largest source of revenue), which issued enough warrants last year to slap three warrants, $312 worth, on every household in the town.

Not surprisingly, high on the list of demands issues at one Ferguson community forum was an end to the overpolicing and criminalization of poverty, an amnesty for old unpaid warrants, new fines proportioned to income and a state law capping municipal revenue from court fees at 10 percent. (Terrified by the Ferguson unrest, the city of St. Louis decided to eliminate 220,000 open arrest warrants for traffic violations last month.) The feeling of being under occupation by an armed force that cares more about meeting revenue quotas than public security corrodes all trust in law enforcement, and is the sort of environment in which police are more likely to open fire.
The state of emergency that Missouri governor Jay Nixon declared on November 17 seems all too likely to encourage the police overkill, both petty and heavily militarized, that shocked the world over the summer, when much of the states use of force against demonstrators was of dubious legality.
New policing models like the problem-solving approach developed by David M. Kennedy and others have focused law enforcement and social work resources on a citys small number of known and likely violent gang members, leaving the rest of the community in relative peace. This approach has won demonstrable results in Boston and Cincinnati without intrusive broken windows policing or the wholesale stop-and-frisk harassment of black and Latino youth. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College, writes in his memoir, Dont Shoot, that this type of community policing doesnt fix the entire economy, but it does reduce homicideincluding police homicideand at least create social peace.
Police demilitarization, the decriminalization of working-class people, new policing models: these are all projects that could work in Ferguson and thousands of other American cities. Although none of these large-scale ideas is explicitly race-conscious, they would most likely tighten the severe racial disparities in policing violence that exist all over the country, more so than pouring more money into racial sensitivity training for cops. (Changing residency requirements of municipal police officers to get a more ethnically representative force might help a little, though research shows that such requirements correlate with less confidence in the police, not more.)
These big-picture reforms are fundamentally political solutions that will require long-term effort, coalition politics that spans race, ethnicity and political affiliationa challenge, but also a necessity. As police and prosecutors assume more and more power in the United Statesregulating immigration (formerly a matter of administrative law), meting out school discipline, and other spheres of everyday life where criminal law was almost unknown even a generation agogetting law enforcement on a tight leash is a national imperative. In the meantime, the constant stream of news reports of unarmed, mostly black and Latino civilians killed by police demands bigger, bolder approaches. They are the only available paths to getting the police under control.

The Nation,L,"Anti-Gay, Anti-Choice Childrens AIDS Fund Still Raking In Taxpayer Money | The Nation","

A health worker counts antiretroviral drug tablets in Uganda. (AP Photo/Stephen Wandera)


In July, I reported that, despite promises President Obama made on the campaign trail, the federal government was still providing millions of dollars in grants for HIV-prevention programming to anti-gay, anti-choice evangelical groups at home and abroad, particularly in Africa. Newly filed 2013 tax documents and a grant tracking website at the Department of Health and Human Services have revealed that one controversial evangelical organization I profiled, the Childrens AIDS Fund (CAF), has again been awarded federal funding. In June 2014, CAF Uganda received $1.5 million as part of a multiyear HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention program. That brings the total CAF Uganda has received since the start of Obamas second term to at least $6.6 million.
This direct funding isnt CAFs only source of federal money. The organization is also a sub-grantee of Catholic Relief Services via the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Response, or PEPFAR, in Zambia. According to Catholic Relief Services most recent tax returns, from 201112, that subgrant amounted to $2.1 million.
CAF openly takes positions that make it ill-suited to deliver public health programming, particularly on HIV/AIDS. Heres how I described it:
[CAF founders Shepherd and Anita Smith] have been vehement foes of what they see as the corrupting influence of LGBT organizations in the field of AIDS relief. In a 2001 speech to the conservative Christian group Concerned Women for America (CWA), Anita said, What we have here is a power struggle between homosexual white men who abuse all the government AIDS programs fundamentally to fund their subculture and their political activities. And the Smiths continue to align themselves with right-wing pro-family organizations. In 2011, for example, the Smiths were featured speakers at the Moscow Demographic Summit, sponsored by the anti-gay World Congress of Families, where the couple spoke alongside representatives of CWA; the Population Research Institute, which promotes the threat of a demographic winter if white Christians dont reproduce in greater numbers; and the Family Research Council. In Uganda, the couple became close allies of Pastor Martin Ssempa, best known for his public condom burnings and anti-gay diatribes, who strongly pushed the anti-homosexuality bill. In 2004, Ssempa became a PEPFAR subgrantee. The Smiths support helped his work get noticed in Washington, and in 2005 he testified on Capitol Hill.
I recently learned that CAFs sway over the USs global AIDS response goes beyond program implementation. In April, Dr. Deborah Birx became the highest-ranking government official in charge of US efforts to combat global AIDS when she was appointed global AIDS coordinator, an ambassador position housed at the State Department. According to PEPFAR estimates, Birx is responsible for overseeing the distribution of approximately $6.5 billion in PEPFAR funds around the globe.
Just eight years ago, Birx was serving on CAFs board of directors alongside the Smiths. According to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, Ambassador Birx resigned from the board in 2005 or 2006 and the last time she attended a board meeting was 2003. But on CAFs 2006 tax return, she was still listed as a board member. In 2012, Birx, then working with the Centers for Disease Control, and a number of other US government officials participated in a conference call with Ugandan LGBT activists, who reportedas they had previouslythat organizations funded by PEPFAR to deliver HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention were drumming up support for the notorious anti-gay bill. One of the organizations the activists highlighted was CAF, which has close ties to an ex-gay ministry called He Intends Victory. Ex-gay pastor and He Intends Victory president Bruce Sonnenberg sits on CAFs board of directors and has for nearly a decademeaning he would have overlapped with Birx on the board.
The Smiths and CAF have long been staunchly opposed to condoms, which they denounce as promoting promiscuity. To bolster their case against condoms, the Smiths repeatedly make inaccurate assertions about condom failure rates and their inefficacy in preventing the spread of HIV. Now CAF seems poised to launch an offensive against pre-exposure prophylaxis, known as PrEP (also known by its brand name, Truvada), an HIV-prevention tool that has been heralded by scores of experts, including Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, Global Advocacy for HIV Prevention. These results are tremendously exciting and confirm that we are at pivotal period in the AIDS epidemic, said Warren.
In September CAF released a policy brief expressing deep reservations about the use of PrEP. Without offering any evidence, the brief claims, Today fewer youth are hearing the message of risk avoidance and increasingly think, if I get infected Ill just take a pill.
PrEP is a method for those at highest risk for HIV exposure to take a once-daily antiretroviral pill in order to prevent infection. While trials are ongoing, the data are promising enough that the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control have both recommended PrEP protocols for certain high-risk populations, including men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men.

Instead of looking at the positive impact PrEP could have in reducing HIV transmission, CAF bemoans the loss of traditional messages of delaying sexual debut. The Smiths and their organization appear to see PrEP as just another excuse for people to act immorally. Members of Ugandan President Yoweri Musevenis administration have made similar claims; last year a program manager with Ugandas Ministry of Health said it wouldnt approve the use of Truvada on moral grounds, claiming its use would encourage reckless sexual behavior.
Despite having been the subject of multiple investigationsCAF was found unfit for funding by a congressional committee as early as 2004and repeated questions about its anti-gay positions, opposition to condoms and support for failed abstinence-only-until-marriage approaches, the Smiths continue to be embraced by government officials as experts in the field of HIV and AIDS.
Just two months ago, Anita Smith was a featured speaker at a PEPFAR-sponsored event called Childrens Risk and Resilience in the Age of HIV/AIDS, where she sat on a panel with representatives of major players in global AIDS such as USAID and Oxford University.
I contacted Ambassador Birxs office to ask why Smith, whose organization is known to disregard public health in favor of ideology, was invited to speak at on the panel. A spokesperson said Birx didnt coordinate or attend the meeting and would not comment further.
Earlier this year, in response to public criticism, PEPFAR announced that it would reduce funding to the Inter-Religious Council of Uganda, which had publicly advocated for Ugandas antigay bill. That decision was made just prior to Birxs appointment. It remains to be seen whether Birx, in her new post, will continue to supply funding and a seat at the table to other antigay organizations, such as her old colleagues at the Childrens AIDS Fund.

Slate,L,Uber raises $1.2 billion: New funding gives Travis Kalanick's ride service a $40 billion valuation.,"Remember Uber's past several weeks? They were ugly. A senior executive was caught discussing plans to conduct opposition research on journalists. Uber's top manager in New York was investigated and disciplined for privacy violations. Almost overnight, all of its data-privacy policies were questioned. With its vast collection of ride logs and team of apparently hapless executives, Uber is seeming less like a sleek taxi alternative and more like a hot target for a disastrous data breach. On top of all that, its marketing claims about the great money drivers earn are looking thin.


But forget all that. Uber's investors just gave it another $1.2 billion.


    Advertisement




Uber is now valued at an astonishing $40 billion after closing a funding round that brings its total financing to about $2.7 billion. In a post on Uber's blog, chief executive Travis Kalanick said the new funds will help fuel Uber's expansion in the Asia Pacific region. Uber, a five-year-old startup, currently operates in more than 250 cities and 50 countries and has grown six-fold in the past year alone. ""This kind of continued growth requires investment,"" Kalanick wrote. The company has also authorized a sale of $600 million more in stock, according to a Thursday filing.


The latest $1.2 billion round comes just six months after Uber said it had raised $1.2 billion from investors including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Google Ventures that valued it at $17 billion. At the time, Will Oremus spelled out in Slate the various cases for why Uber may or may not have been worth that staggering sum. While Uber's new valuation is more than double the old, the basic points are the same:


1. The optimistic analysis: Uber is not just replacing the taxi industry. It's going after the differentand much, much biggermarket for public transportation. In the vague and distant future, Uber rides could become so cheap that they replace car ownership entirely. And if the self-driving car ever becomes a reality, Uber could be positioned to serve as the dominant or exclusive provider of those trips.


2. The skeptical analysis: Uber so far has made its fortune by barging into markets heedless of local laws and regulations. Should it ever come under serious scrutiny from regulators, its operations could take a devastating hit. Uber also has plenty of competitors, and the barriers to entry for the ride-sharing business are low. Neither Uber's drivers nor its riders have any particular loyalty to the company. If a better service comes along, they won't hesitate to switch.


Based on the past few weeks, Uber's management issues would also seem to be a strike against it. As I outlined in late November, Uber's sprawling, largely decentralized structure has at times helped to empower rash and immature actors. Until very recently, Uber has also failed to scale its communications team along with its rapidly expanding business. A good portion of its missteps in the past year can be traced to that disconnect, and many have called for the company to grow up.


On the other hand, Uber just weathered arguably its worst PR disaster everand came out $1.2 billion richer! Emil Michael, the executive who made the ""oppo research"" comments, is still in his job, as is New York City's Josh Mohrer, the subject of Uber's internal investigation into privacy violations.


In his blog post, Kalanick nodded to the company's latest blunders. ""The events of the recent weeks have shown us that we also need to invest in internal growth and change,"" he wrote. ""Fortunately, taking swift action is where Uber shines, and we will be making changes in the months ahead. Done right, it will lead to a smarter and more humble company that sets new standards in data privacy, gives back more to the cities we serve, and defines and refines our company culture effectively.""


It would be fascinating to know just how many of those changes Uber had to detail for investors before they forked over an additional $1.2 billion. The optimistic answer to that is a lot. The pessimistic one is none at all. Blunders and privacy violations and controversies aside, Silicon Valley might just think that Uber is a shining investment opportunity with a tremendous amount of upside (if also a serious amount of risk). And good luck letting ethics find a place in that discussion.

Slate,L,Warren Buffett Ready for Hillary donation: Gives maximum to Clinton super PAC.,"Two months ago, Warren Buffett told attendees at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit that he was putting his money on Hillary Clinton. ""Hillary is going to win,"" the Oracle of Omaha told Carol Loomis onstage. ""I will bet money on it.""

Based on a new report in Bloomberg Politics, we now know that Buffett wasn't joking. The famed investor wrote a check for $25,000 to Ready for Hillary last quarterthe biggest donation allowed for an individual. According to Bloomberg Politics, the donation is also the first Buffett has ever made to a super PAC:


The contribution marks a major shift for one of the country's most famous business leaders, who's long been known in Democratic circles as a bit of a political tightwad. Though he's given hundreds of thousands to party committees and candidates, Buffett has shunned super-political action committees and other groups that can take unlimited sums. Last cycle, he headlined fundraisers for Obamas re-election, though he rebuffed solicitations by Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC supporting the president.

Buffett is a well-known supporter of Clinton. He backed her 2008 campaign and welcomed her to Twitter with one of his five-ever tweets when she joined in June 2013. Ready for Hillary, which has no official ties to Clinton, has reportedly raised more than $11 million and is expected to file a financial disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission by midnight on Thursday.

Slate,L,James Watson Nobel Prize auction: Medal for DNA discovery gets $4.1 million at Christie's.,"James Watson's Nobel Prize medal, awarded for his work in discovering the structure of DNA, was sold at Christie's for $4.1 million on Thursday, above the predicted price range of $2.5 to $3.5 million. Including an additional ""buyer's premium"" fee for the auction house, the total price the anonymous purchaser will pay is $4.757 million.

Watson has been criticized widely in recent years for his long history of making disparaging remarks about women and minorities; Slate's Laura Helmuth characterized him as a ""peevish bigot"" a piece on Dec. 1. He was forced to retire as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory after saying in 2007 that Africans are less intelligent than other types of people. Other recent highlights include his 2012 observation on women in science: I think having all these women around makes itmore fun for the men, but theyre probably less effective.


    Advertisement




The sale is believed to be the first sale of a Nobel medal by a living winner of the prize. The medal of Waton's partner Francis Crick garnered $2.27 million in a posthumous auction at Dallas-based Heritage Auctions last year. The price fetched by Crick's medal prompted Waton's decision to sellin the pre-lot text provided to Christie's, he wrote, ""I knew I would soon auction off my 1962 Gold Nobel Medal the moment I learned that Francis Cricks Gold Medal, May 2013, had been so sold for more than two million dollars."" Watson also told the Financial Times that he hopes to regain public attention from the sale since becoming an alienated ""unperson"" because of his controversial comments.


Before the Crick auction, the only public auction of a Nobel Prize was that of Niels Bohr's 1975 Physics medal, auctioned off by an anonymous seller for the bargain price of around $75,000; William Faulkner's 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature went unsold at auction at Sotheby's last June.


Asked about Watson's notoriety, the international director of printed books and manuscripts for Christie's told the New York Times that ""Thomas Jefferson said some controversial things too,"" adding: ""As far as Christies is concerned, the monumental discovery of the double helix is what this is about.""

Slate,L,Jon Stewart on Eric Garner: The Daily Show got serious on the grand jury decision (VIDEO).,"On Wednesday, a Staten Island grand jury announced it would not indict the police officer caught on video choking Eric Garner to death in July. That night, Jon Stewart opened the Daily Show with an uncharacteristically serious speech about the decision. If comedy is tragedy plus time, I need more fucking time, he said, noting that the Eric Garner decision came just days after last weeks grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for the death of Michael Brown. But I would really settle for less fucking tragedy.

Weve seen Stewart take on a more sober tone beforemost famously in his first show after 9/11and, once again, hes summed up whats on a lot of peoples minds: Were definitely not living in a post-racial society.

Slate,L,"Running calculator: Introducing Slates marathon time predictor, a better way to calculate how fast youll run.","If youve ever used a running calculator to pace yourself for a marathon, theres a good chance you set yourself up for failure. As I explained in a piece earlier this year, most finish-time calculatorslike this one from Runners Worldrely on an algorithm developed by engineer and runner Peter Riegel in the 1980s. The Riegel formula is based on the idea that you slow down by a certain amount as a race gets longer, what he called the fatigue factor. According to Riegel, you cant predict how fast youll run a marathon by doubling your time over 13.1 miles. Rather, you can get a better estimate by multiplying your half-marathon time by 2.085.

Andrew Vickers, a competitive runner and statistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was convinced that we could come up with a better formula. Back in April, we asked for your help to find out if he was right.


Nearly 2,500 Slate readers answered the call, providing real-world race data to help Vickers and his colleagues build a better calculator. We ended up with results from 929 marathons, 1,446 half-marathons, 888 10K races, and 1,293 5Ks. The average woman who submitted data to the survey (39 percent of our respondents were female) was around 34.5 years old and ran about 29 miles a week. The average man was about 37.5 years old and ran around 35 miles a week. Runners completing the survey ranged from 16-year-olds to those in their mid-70s.


    Advertisement




To devise the calculator, Vickers randomly divided the data into three groups. He developed a new marathon prediction formula using the first of those groups and tested it using data from another. He is reserving the final group to present when we publish the study in a scientific journal.


When Vickers group crunched the numbers, they found that the Riegel formula works well when youre using one short race to predict your time for another short race. Your 10K time is pretty close to your 5K time multiplied by 2.085.

But the Riegel formula falls apart when you move up to the marathon. A typical runner in our study with a 1:45 half-marathon time (8 minutes per mile) had a marathon time of 3:53:10 (thats 8:54 per mile). Yet the Runner's World calculator predicts that this runner will finish in 3:38:5515 minutes faster than the actual result. Thats an absolutely massive error, says Vickers. If this runner paced himself according to the Riegel prediction, he would start the race at a pace that was more than 30 seconds per mile too fast. No wonder so many runners blow up and limp to the finish, Vickers says.


According to the numbers in our study, a more accurate formula for predicting a marathon time is your half-marathon time multiplied by 2.19. With that formula as a starting point, Vickers and his colleagues made tweaks to reflect the other lessons they pulled from the study. As youd expect, training volumemiles run per week in preparation of a racehad a measurable influence on marathon times. You might run a quick 5K, but if you dont put in the miles, your marathon is going to be on the slow side, Vickers says. Adjusting the formula to reflect training miles improved its accuracy. Our study also found that the extent to which you slow down between two shorter races, such as a 10K and a half-marathon, also reveals how much youre likely to slow down between a short race and a marathon. Contrary to Vickers expectation, though, we found that age and gender had no influence on how a runners pace slowed from a short to a long race.


The Slate marathon calculator uses a formula adjusted to reflect your training miles. The tool performs best when you can give us your times for two previous races of different distances, though it can also be used if you input only one previous race time.




Our formula predicts that a 1:45 half-marathoner who trains 30 to 40 miles per week will finish a marathon in 3:54:50. Thats still a little bit off from the real-world results we saw in our surveya minute and 40 seconds slower than the actual time. But if youre using a calculator to pace yourself, Vickers says, youre better off leaving a little in the tank for the end, when you can make up some time, rather than going out too fast and setting yourself up for a miserable finish.


Before you try the calculator, a few words of caution. Though we found that a runners age didnt affect her predicted marathon time, we also didn't have many older runners in our sample, so its possible our predictor doesn't work as well for runners over age 60. Predictions will also be less accurate in absolute terms for slower runners, Vickers says. That makes sense, because while few runners expecting to run a 2:45 marathon end up finishing in 2:30, its not uncommon for a 5-hour marathoner to run 15 minutes faster or slower than expected. In percentage terms we do just fine with slower runners; in terms of absolute time, we do slightly worse, Vickers says.


Finally, a race that is either very difficult (because of an especially tough course or terrible weather) or very fast (because of special conditions such as a tailwind or downhill slope) makes a bad basis for predicting your marathon time, unless that marathon will be similarly hard or fast.


So, with those caveats out of the way,scroll back to the top of the page and give our new calculator a try.

Slate,L,New York Times notable books of 2014 list incites Ayelet Waldman to twitter fury. ,"The New York Times unveiled its annual roundup of 100 Notable Books Tuesday, throwing a flattering light on 2014s top fiction and nonfiction offerings. But one author did not come off in a flattering light: Ayelet Waldman stormed Twitter to complain that her novel Love and Treasure wasnt on the list, despite a favorable review from the Times back in May. (For what its worth, Waldmans skin seems to have unique, flattering-light-repellant properties. Shes a provocateur who has detailed the trials of perhaps not loving her children enough and of being the only mother in her social circle to enjoy a passionate, consuming sex life.)

Waldmans opening shot:


    Advertisement




""I am really not dealing well with having failed to make the @nytimes notable book list. Love & Treasure is a fucking great novel IISSM.""


(IISSM in this context means neither the International Institute of Security and Safety Management nor the Invisible Idiocracy of Snubbing Stellar Manuscripts, but if I say so myself. Waldman has since deleted her tweets, but you can see them on The Daily Dot.)


She continues:


""I never complain about this shit, but there are MANY books on that notable list with reviews that were NOWHERE near as good as mine.""


""What do they mean by 'Notable?' How does a book that got a decidedly mediocre review count as ""notable"" when one with a good one doesn't?""


""Sometimes ""being a writer"" totally sucks. If it weren't for the actual writing, I think I'd go back to being a criminal defense attorney.""


""It's just so fucking demoralizing. You pour your heart into your work, you get awesome reviews, and then someone decides it's not 'notable.'""


""I mean. Why do I bother? I could write a fucking journal.""


""I'm sorry I'm being such a pussy. There are real problems in the world. I'm just going to suck it up and do something good for someone else.""


""You know what? Do me a favor. Preorder my fucking paperback to make me feel better.""


""For every preorder I'll donate $1 to http://www.scholarmatch.com. Fuck the fucking NY Times.""


Waldman, who is again no stranger to public criticism, came in for plenty of mockery. Ayelet Waldmanhas written a blog about her disgust at being left out of the new Bond cast. And that its not called Ayelet, tweeted Patrick Ness. And Joanne Harris lamented in faux-solidarity: I should have a Nobel Prize by now. And a pastel pony of my very own. Yet the Bad Mother author doesnt regret her outburst and has posted a defense of her behavior to Facebook. Theres something fetchingly bravura about this mix of honesty, extravagance (nine whole tweets to slam a subjective list of faves?), and diva-dom. Plus, Waldman raises an interesting point: How do the books get chosen, anyway?


Weve had some form of the Notable Books [feature] for a long time, New York Times Book Review editor Pamela Paul told me. The paper used to publish a weekly column, And Bear in Mind, that highlighted titles the editors believed worthy of particular literary, topical or scholarly interest. Then, during the tenure of Pauls predecessor Sam Tanenhaus, the rubric was reborn as Editors Choice. At the end of each year, Paul explained, all of the volumes called out in Editors Choice, ne And Bear in Mind, ascend to one grand Notable Books roundup, like the souls of the saved rising to heaven. The list simply represents the best books weve reviewed that year, said Paul. Its quality. What other criteria would there be?


I suggested a few lowlier metrics, like sales, impact, and cultural omnipresence.


Well, we do hope that theres some overlap between quality and newsworthiness and attention, Paul said, though that doesnt have to be the case.


Has she been following the Waldman Twitterstorm?

Every year there are people that are unhappy that this book, that book, their book, didnt make the list, Paul said tactfully. One hundred seems like an awfully big number, but in fact the Times only has space to review 1 percent of any given annums published titles. Of those volumes, only a tiny fraction can appear in the December spotlight. Were not scraping the bottom of the barrel with Notable Books, Paul emphasized. Theres a huge body of work out there, and every year there are narrow misses that an editor, two editors, five editors, feel bad about leaving off.


But, according to Paul, the real pressure comes in when Book Review staffers have to select the 10 Best Books of the year. We know that pain. Here are Slates picks, as well as our favorite overlooked titles and incandescent lines. (Sorry, Ayelet Waldman! You are definitely on our 2014 docket of most entertaining literary Twitter rants.)

Slate,L,Ferguson grand jury investigation: A shadow trial violates the publics right to access.,"St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCullochs decision to open up the grand jury proceedings by including massive amounts of testimony and evidence has been decried ashighly unusual, deeply unfair,and evidence that police officer Darren Wilson receivedspecial treatment. McCullochs move to include a good deal of exculpatory evidence and testimony led to a three-month, closed-door proceeding that included 70 hours of testimony, including 60 witnesses and three medical examiners. The breadth of the evidence presented to the grand jury has led many to declare that it turned the entire proceeding into something that walks and quacks an awful lot like a trial, but without many of the procedural rules that would make a trial truly fair.

This move to morph a grand jury inquiry, which is typically a short rundown of the case for the prosecution, into a trial-like parade of mountains of evidence raises serious issues about the rights of Michael Browns family to have a fair process for their dead son, as well as highlighting concerns about unequal treatment of different kinds of criminal defendants. But seemingly lost in this jumble of legal concerns is the fact that McCullochs decision to shift the truth-seeking function of a criminal trial into the secret realm of the grand jury room violated another set of constitutional rightsours. It violated our collective public right to an open criminal justice system. And if ever there was a trial to which Americans deserved a meaningful right of access, Wilsons trial was it. Instead, we have a post-hoc document dump.


In the 1980 case ofRichmond Newspapers v.Virginia, the Supreme Court declared that the press and public have a First Amendment right of access to criminal trials. In the words of Justice William Brennan, Open trials are bulwarks of our free and democratic government: Public access to court proceedings is one of the numerous checks and balances of our system, because contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power. 


    Advertisement




This right of open trials belongs not just to the accused but to all of us. It is, the Supreme Court said in the 1986 casePress Enterprise v. Superior Court, a shared right of the accused and the public, the common concern being the assurance of fairness. And while those accused of crimes have a constitutional right to a speedy and open trial, they do not, the court has said, have a right to a private trial.



Closed trials breed suspicion of prejudice and arbitrariness, which in turn spawns disrespect for law.
Justice William Brennan



In discussing the history and need for open trials roughly three decades ago, it was as if the court were imagining this weeks situation in Ferguson rather specifically. The community at large has a massive stake in the criminal justice process, the court said. Whether it is to make sure an innocent person is not imprisoned or a guilty one is not allowed to walk free, the conduct of the trial is preeminently a matter of public interest. Think about the closed doors in Ferguson these past months as you reflect on what Chief Justice Warren Burger famously explained: When a shocking crime occurs, a community reaction of outrage and public protest often follows. Thereafter the open processes of justice serve an important prophylactic purpose, providing an outlet for community concern, hostility, and emotion.


The fact that 12 jurors witnessed the proceedings in St. Louis does not cure the constitutional violation. While jurors can function as surrogates for the public and a check on government misfeasance, the court affirmed in Richmond Newspapers that by impaneling a jury, the community did not surrender its right to observe the conduct of trials or its ability to satisfy themselves that justice was in fact being done. Disclosing results alone, the court declared, will not satiate the natural community desire for satisfaction,  and an unexpected outcome can cause a reaction that the system at best has failed and at worst has been corrupted.


While the Supreme Court has never declared a right of access to grand jury proceedings, it has held that closure of pretrial proceedings that function like trials is unconstitutional. InPress Enterprise, for example, a 41-day probable-cause hearing was closed to the press and the public. Under California law, the probable-cause hearing was designed to determine whether the defendant could stand trial for the charges, much like in a grand jury proceeding. But, the court noted, the state process allowed broad introduction of evidence, meaning that it was often the final and most important step in the criminal proceeding and the sole occasion for public observation of the criminal justice system.


Closed trials have serious costs. Brennan told us that they breed suspicion of prejudice and arbitrariness, which in turn spawns disrespect for law. And Burger explained that people in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.Furthermore, according to Burger, the crucial prophylactic aspects of the administration of justice cannot function in the dark; no community catharsis can occur if justice is done in a corner [or] in any covert manner.  Yet that is precisely what this strange shadow trial from Ferguson became. It may as well have been done in a corner.


That secrecy was not cured in any way by the after-the-fact document dump with which the prosecutors office released the materials considered by the grand jury. Certainly giving all of us access to the materials created the appearance of a wholly transparent and open process. But it seems to have had largely the effect of reinforcing peoples beliefs. Michael Browns supporters insist he was an unarmed kid, killed by a trigger happy white cop, and Wilsons supporters insist he was justifiably defending himself from an animal who was poised to kill him. By dumping all of the evidence and allowing us to arrive at our own conclusions, absent any context or process or ability to judge the credibility of witnesses, we have been handed the criminal equivalent of one of those choose-your-own-adventure books, in which we can all find an interpretation that conforms to our pre-existing ideas.


In the end, we all got to bear witness not to a fair and open trial, but to parts of it that do not add up to openness, fairness, or justice. We cannot believe in the fairness of a process we cannot see, and we should not be led to believe in the fairness of a process because a prosecutors office asserts that we have seen all we need to.

Slate,L,We Second That Second Novel List: Marlon James The Book of Night Women.,"Reading a book about tragedy is not itself a moral act. Many books are written as if feeling a lot of sympathy is enough to keep the reader on the right side of history, but Marlon James doesnt play that game. His second novelThe Book of Night Womenthe fourth book of five were naming this week to We Second That: The Slate/Whiting Second Novel Listis not a redemption narrative. Redemption is tough to find on a plantation in Jamaica in 1801. As the main character, strong-willed teenage slave Lilith, learns from killing, blood dont taste like wineand as long as there is slavery there will be blood. Page after page, in small ways and large, James made me realize how rote and well-established my emotional responses are.


 


 

Liliths father is the overseer. After killing a man who tries to rape her, Lilith is taken under cover of darkness into the kitchen of the big house, sheltered by Homer, the head of the relatively privileged house slaves. Like many teenagers, Lilith lives essentially for herself, but in a culture of terror this has a harder edge. She hopes her white master will notice her beauty and raise her up above the other slaves, but when faced with abuse, she has something in her that cant help but fight, that cant bend too low. Lilith thinks often about the light in her and the darkness, of how she contains both, just as she contains white and black blood. Homer sees this fire in her and believes that she will help with the uprising the night women are planning, inspired by the successful Saint-Domingue rebellion led by Toussaint Louverture.


A big, masterful novel like this raises questions without answering themit raises questions that stay raised. Reading this book, I was ashamed at the relative paucity of my historical curiosity and imagination. I once argued with my husband that we should name our son Toussaint, for example, but James unflinching engagement with history made me realize that I have read books on how Nazis, fascists, and communists found willing executioners, but never one on the psychology of the overseers of 400 years of slavery. This epic, beautiful, complicated, enthralling book, filled with damaged people living in the misery of a plantation, where white man sleep with one eye open, but black man can never sleep, raises an obvious question: Who the hell were these white people? They werent aberrant sadiststhey constituted basically the entire white population of their communities. Its horrible to ask this question because the odds overwhelmingly suggest that if any of us, regardless of race, had been raised by slaveholders, we would probably be able sit on our porches watching whippings and hangings while drinking lemonade.

James inspires courage of imagination, he has traversed light and darkness, he has traversed centuries, and he has traversed gender. As the title suggests, this is a book about women, each with her own path through enslavement and her own injuries. Of the six women who plan the uprising, one has been shot blind in one eye, one had her throat slit as a child and has lived as a mute, one is scarred top to toe from the deliberate sprinkling of hot coals by an overseer. Their leader has a quilt of scar tissue on her back from whippings and breasts branded to mangled nubs. These women hide their scars beneath scarves and bonnets and clothes. These women have been maimed, inside and out, and so this is also a book about how the indomitable human impulses toward kindness, love, friendship, family, and loyalty are warped so absolutely in a slaves life as to make a mockery of them. It is also, surprisingly, a heartbreaking love story, of a man and woman haltingly trying, and mostly failing, to overcome their status of slave and master.


This is a vast, deep book. Many chapters begin with the same two sentences: Every negro walk in a circle. Take that and make of it what you will. In trying to tell why this book should be read, I feel like I could walk in circles, to the well and back, and always my bucket would come up with a new reason. Take this book, and make of it what you will.

Slate,L,"Adam Voorhes photographs a rare collection of brains in his book, Malformed: Forgotten Brains of the Texas State Mental Hospital, with Alex Hannaford.","During previous editorial assignments at the University of Texas, Adam Voorhes had come across everything from a set of antique vacuum tubes to a collection of wood letterpress type to a bunch of robots. But no one had thought to show him the storage closet full of brains in the Animal Resources Center until 2011.



He was at the university to take a photo of a brainjust a regular brain, nothing specialfor Scientific American. But the 100 brains he found in the closet, which were stacked two jars deep on 10-foot-wide floor-to-ceiling shelves, were far from ordinary. All, in fact, were malformed or somehow abnormal.He decided to investigate.





  This brain belonged to a patient suffering from lissencephaly, which causes smooth surfaces rather than folds on portions of the brain. A perfectly smooth brain such as this is extremely rare. Adam Voorhes


 


  This cracked jar and illegible label illustrate neglect of guardianship for the collection. Adam Voorhes


 


  This heart and brain, preserved together, had the consistency of jelly. Adam Voorhes


 

Alongwith journalist Alex Hannaford, Voorhes traced the history of the brains. Dating back to the 1950s, they belonged to patients from Austin State Hospital (once the Texas State Lunatic Asylum). The collectionrare for its size, age, and diversitycame to the University of Texas as a gift in 1986 (other universities, including Harvard, had tried, and failed, to secure the collection) after the hospital ran out of space to store it. It is currently being used as a teaching tool by the psychology department.

As Voorhes began photographing the collection, he strove for a clean, graphic, slightly sterile look, which he achieved through high-resolution, large format images. Donning respirators and heavy rubber gloves, he joined Dr. Neal Rutledge, an Austin-based neurointerventional surgeon, and Tim Schallert, a University of Texas professor, ina makeshift studio in the lab adjacent to the storage closet. For two days, they worked with the brains and Voorhes captured more than 200 images in total, many of which will be published in an upcoming book, Malformed: Forgotten Brains of the Texas State Mental Hospital, out from PowerHouse Books last month.


I wanted to study the collection with light, try to make it as beautiful as possible, but not manipulate or misrepresent anything. I wanted to study the texture of the brains, the labels, the wax dripping down the glass, cracks and chips in the jars, Voorhes said via email.

Some of the brains were firm and easy to handle. Others, however, were heavily damaged by cysts, Alzheimers, or meningitis and therefore too delicate to remove fromtheir jars. Among the brains were rare specimens including a smooth brain belonging to a patient who suffered from Lissencephaly. Many of the patients suffered from disorders that could be managed today. ... Im surprised they passed away in a mental hospital rather than an emergency room, he said.




Even as science journals have published new research about the brains, and the University of Texas has begun creating MRI scans of the specimens, the collection is still surrounded by mystery. According to Hannafords research, the collection was originally twice its current sizebut nobody knows how 100 human brains disappeared from the university in the past 30 years. One of those brains belonged to Charles Whitman, who, in 1966, killed 16 people and wounded 32 others at the University of Texas at Austin.


For a while, Hannaford and Voorhes searched for microfilm containing patient records, but the effort lead to a dead end. Still, Voorhes hopes his project will inspire more investigation and secure the collections continued maintenance.


I wanted to preserve the collection, if only visually,Voorhessaid.It spurred so many questions that kept floating around in my head, most of them are still unanswered.



  This is the brain that made Voorhes want to find the medical records of the brains. The case number was partially illegible but could be salvaged. Adam Voorhes

Slate,L,Purity Ring Push Pull track: Duos first new album material since their debut is great (VIDEO).,"Since their 2012 debut Shrines, Purity Ring has recorded playful, cross-genre collaborations with Danny Brown and Jon Hopkins and released a surprising Soulja Boy cover that still creeps into rotation on my playlist. Finally, though, theyre back to working on original material, and new track Push Pull provides a welcome preview of the duos upcoming sophomore album, which comes out next year.

Megan James vocals overlay Corin Roddicks tinkling, synth-filled production to slightly more anthemic effect than we heard on Shrines. But their brand of pop remains pleasantly unsettling. And the lyrics maintain an interest in the body as a metaphor: I crept up in you and I wouldnt let go. Listen below.

Q. Hottie Helper: I recently went back to work after the birth of my second child. My husband and I have been floored by how challenging it is to have two kids and two working parents in one household. We have arranged to have a young woman live rent-free in our basement, in exchange for being our family helper. She drives the kids to preschool, cooks occasional dinners, cleans the house, etc. Its a sweet gig for all involved, the girl is a great fit for my family, and we are happy to help her out while she goes to college. Theres a hitch. Shes incredibly sexy and dresses in a way that leaves little to the imagination: skin-tight leggings, spaghetti-strap tanks with nothing underneath. I dont get the feeling from my husband that he even notices, but it wigs me out. Should I just acknowledge this as a non-threat and work on my own insecurities, or address her and ask her to cover up?


A: What you describe her wearing is standard for college students, and absolutely standard for someone relaxing at home. The issue is not her clothes, but that she is a gorgeous, taut young woman, and you are feeling like a less taut, overwhelmed, not-so-young woman. Im assuming your husband actually has noticed, but hes a gentleman and has learned how to keep his eyeballs in his head. You, too, have to keep your head screwed on right. This is about you, not her, and not your husband. You have solved one of the grinding problems working people with young children face. So congratulate yourself and enjoy the extra pair of hands, and stop dwelling on the fact that the hands are attached to someone stunning.

Q. Work From Home Frustrations: I am lucky to have a job where I can work from home two days a week. My husband is not technically allowed to work from home, but does so when I am home with the blessing of his boss. Its driving me nuts. We are not able to work in separate areas because we live in a small condo, and he works in cold calling sales, so I am not able to get the quiet I need. When I leave the condo to work elsewhere, he comes with me! His idea of being by ourselves means with each other, but focused on other things. How can I help him see that I need some time to be truly alone?


A: I work at home, and occasionally my husband does, too. Usually were on different floors, typing away like quiet little mice. But occasionally he has a phone call, and when he does he likes to bellow into the phone and walk in circles, so that I hear the rising and falling of his voice as he makes his circuit. Ive very sweetly said to him, If you dont lower your voice and stay put, Im going to take your phone and throw it out the window. Give me your address; I can come over to your place and say it to your husband, or better yet just toss the phone out the window. Help him see hes driving you around the bend by saying something to the effect of despite how much you love him, youll have to hit his phone with a hammer because you cant work when someone is cold-calling people 5 feet away from you. Tell him that if he doesnt stop working at home, youre going to, because you need a room of your own to be able to think in peace.


Q. Kitchen Clean-Up Time Limit: What is the maximum time between when one prepares food and when one cleans up? My wife thinks that as long as it is cleaned up before bed, its OK. The result is a litter of cutting board, plates, etc., from breakfast through dinner attracting ants to our kitchen. I think one must clean up as one goes, and everything should be cleaned up within a few minutes of eating the meal. My wife says that robs the meal of enjoyment. Where do you come down?


A: I come down on hoping you two have a killer time in bed, otherwise I have a portrait of your marriage as an endless cycle of conflict over sloth and compulsion, focused on the cutting board. I hate a messy kitchen and my more casual husband has come to recognize its more pleasant for him to clean up after himself rather than deal with me hating a messy kitchen. But I will clean his mess myself rather than look at a dirty counter and sink. You two are out of sync on this issue. Shes a slob and youre more than meticulous. If you cant move her, surely its better to just sweep up the crumbs and wash off the cutting board yourself rather than fight over the parade of ants.


Q. Re: Hottie Helper ...: What if the letter writer insists the girl wear one of those French maid costumes while on duty?


A: Thank you for the laugh!


Q. Missing Gift?: I got married two weeks ago, and invited my boss, whom I have a good relationship with. He is very generous when people have babies, get married, etc. However, he did not give a gift for my wedding. I found it odd, but the money is not whats important. However, when I mentioned this to a co-worker who is also a close friend (I would never speak about this to a casual colleague). She says she swears she saw him with a card, she remembers it was bright blue, and he was holding it when he walked in. Now Im afraid it was misplaced or lost. Is there anyway to bring this up with him without coming off as a present-grabber? I cant think of a scenario that wont be extremely awkward.




A: This is awkward, so the best thing to do is go to him and acknowledge this. Tell him his presence as your wedding was all the present you need, but you have something awkward to run by him. Say that when you were talking to a colleague who was at the wedding, she mentioned that the boss arrived with a bright blue card. Tell him you dont know if shes misremembering, but it concerned you because you never got said card. So if he did leave one on the gift table, you need to try to find out what happened to it. Tell him that if he didnt, it will relieve your mind and reassure you that no one at the wedding was light-fingered.


Q. Re:Working From Home: OyI also work from home, having lost my corporate job two years ago and had no luck in finding a job. I have worked hard to develop a law practice from home, which allows me to spend time with my husband, who is a health care professional and keeps unusual hours, be around for my teenage son, and to help with a variety of eldercare responsibilities. Everyone is happy with this situation. But my husband and son will sometimes convene in my home office during working hours to discuss the latest football or hockey game. Threatening to get a lock for the door, or reading my very boring legal documents aloud seems to help.


A: You dont need a lock if you can just start intoning, The party of the first part 


Q. Jewish Santa: My fianc and I are set to get married next summer, and surely kids wont be too far off. For most disagreements, weve been pretty good about finding a compromise or one person ceding ground where it doesnt matter. For instance, she is Jewish and I was raised Catholic but am an atheist. She asked that our kids be raised Jewish (to which I agreed as I think there is a great benefit to having a moral structure). However, one sticking point we have is Santa. I strongly believe Santa (and Christmas) is a cultural holiday and want to celebrate it as such. Shes fine with celebrating Christmas, but for her, Santa is a religious symbol and is out of the question. Im struggling to see if theres a middle ground here and how to solve our predicament.


A: There seems to be some major Judeo-Christian confusion in your home. I do not understand your Jewish wifes embrace of Christmas and rejection of Santa. Santa is a far step removed from the celebration of the birth of Christ, so maybe your wife needs an introductory religion course. Its good you two are talking this out, because too many interfaith couples wait until its time to the trip to the mall for the photo with Santa to air their differences. However, there is also something a little odd about getting hung up more than six months before the wedding about how your nonexistent children will celebrate Christmas. I suggest you two take some classes offered by a local synagogue or Jewish community center for interfaith couples. That will give you a forum to figure out Santa, and a lot more issues.


Q. For Your Eyes Only: My husband and I have had a rocky sexual relationship. One day, while looking for something on his computer, I stumbled across websites where hed posted compromising pictures of me. When confronted, he admitted it and apologized. Im feeling betrayed because these photos he took of me I expressly said I wanted to be for his eyes only. But your photos made it into the top 10! he told me, based on the rating system. Please help.


A: Revenge porn is a horror. But this is the first Ive heard of My wife is hot, and she doesnt know Im posting this porn. The violation here is stunning. You dont just have a rocky sex life, you have a rocky marriage. Your husbands behavior is shocking and grounds for you to be reassessing this marriage. First of all, insist he take everything down and never post anything about you again. Second, go to a marriage counselor together. You may not even want to salvage this relationship, but talking to a third party will give you some clarity about your next steps.


Q. Re: Missing Gift: This happened at my wedding too, and many more Im sure. Please, Dear, Dear Prudie, tell people NOT to bring gifts to the wedding! Ship it before, ship it after, whatever, but a table at a wedding reception is not a safe place for a gift.


A: Miss Manners has hit this important point for decades to little effect. There are always going to be people who bring gifts. So at the venue its a good idea to have some kind of locked closet or secure room, or even the trunk of a car, where the gifts are stored to reduce the temptation.


Q. Re: Hottie Helper: I had an extremely beautiful au pair when my children were young and I was a little worried. The au pair coordinator said something that helped me a great deal: The attractive au pairs can do so much better than your husband! That made me giggle.


A: Love it! Thanks.


Q. Just Not Quite There: Im a happy woman in her 20s with a lovely boyfriend, and am starting a new career. The problem is, I cant seem to have an orgasm. Ever. Not even by myself. Ive read books, spent time on it, and now just fake it for my partner because I just want him to be happy and satisfied enough for the both of us. But Prudie I am so frustrated, is this just something that happens to some women and am I doomed to be forever sexually frustrated?


A: I answered this question recently here, and among my suggestions was the purchase of the Magic Wand, available on Amazon. Read the explosive reviews. And if you do get the wand, and it does do the trick, in between climaxes write back and let us know.

Slate,L,"Hawaiian ""Mele Kalikimaka,"" Greek ""khristos,"" Xmas, and why not ""Hristmas"": Sound changes in Christmas vocabulary.","""Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say / On a bright Hawaiian Christmas day""

What makes Bing Crosby's classic Christmas tune (well, the other one anyway) so endearing? At least part of the appeal is ""Mele Kalikimaka"" itself, which sounds tantalizingly close to ""Merry Christmas"" and yet not quite the same. So how did the Hawaiian language end up with this phrase?


    Advertisement




Simply put, Hawaiian borrowed the English ""Merry Christmas,"" which speakers then adapted to fit the sounds of their language. In the video below, YouTuber Tom Scott explains how this process happened:









You can also think about English Christmas itself. Although the spelling hasn't changed, we've worn down the pronunciation a bit over the years from christ+mass to criss-miss: English vowels frequently morph into schwas, and when was the last time you heard someone actually pronounce that T?


Even with the T, of course, the Christ part of Christmas isn't Jesus' last name. Rather it's a title that comes from the Latin Christusitself from the Greek khristos () meaning ""the anointed""a literal translation of the Hebrew mashiah (also the source of messiah). The ""kh"" in khristos represents the Greek letter chi, written X, which in Ancient Greek sounded a lot like, well, a K followed by an H (as in a careful pronunciation of steakhouse or backhand). Latin didn't use the letter K, so the Romans wrote it as ""C+H"" instead. But people pretty quickly started ignoring the H since there weren't any domestic Latin words with that K/C+H sound. Unless you knew Greek, you didn't really know what to do with words like chorus, chaos, or Achilles, and you just reverted to a hard C.


In fact, we narrowly escaped having the same confusion over the spelling of Christmas as we do over the spelling of Hanukkah (or is it Chanukkah?). The sound at the beginning of Hanukkah/Chanukkah isn't particularly common in English, but you may have encountered it in Scottish lochor German Bach. To some people, it sounds like a breathier /k/ (hence the C+H, which this time indicates breathiness), while to others it just sounds like a variation of /h/ itself. So Chanukkah and Hanukkah represent two different ways people have tried to explain this sound to English speakers. Neither are completely successful, because it's just plain hard to produce a sound that you're not accustomed towhich is why Latin ended up with the /k/ sound for ""ch"" and Hawaiian ended up with Mele Kalikimaka.


Back to Christmas. Although the Ancient Greeks pronounced the kh in khristos as K+H, theysome centuries latereventually started pronouncing all instances of the letter chi as that same breathy sound found in loch, Bach, or Chanukkah/Hanukkah. So if we'd borrowed khristos at a much later date, and not via Latin, we might have ended up trying to write it phonetically using hHristmas!which is in fact what Modern Greek speakers often end up doing when they're writing informally in our alphabet. But we didn't, so we don't.


And the fact that Greek chi is written X explains yet another Christmas linguistic mystery: why Christmas is abbreviated Xmas. It's originally Chi-mas, but English speakers don't pronounce it that way because of a further orthographic complication. When the Romans were borrowing and adapting the Greek alphabet, they managed to borrow the symbol X from a group of Greeks who used it to stand for the sound /ks/, despite the fact that the majority of Greekswho they later borrowed lots of words from, including christusused X to stand for that K+H sound.

The really inexplicable thing is why the Romans bothered borrowing anything to stand for /ks/, when they could have just written it with two letters, like they did with psi  as in psychology. But not to worry. As far as I know, Bing Crosby never wrote a song about how to say Merry Christmas in Ancient Greek.

Slate,L,Single-sex classroom research: Fake brain science supports gender segregation.,"Sometimes its hard to believe were living in the 21st century. Thanks to a tide of distorted brain-based education, some 750 public schools around the United States have been segregating boys and girls into single-sex classrooms that sound like the old woodshop and home economics classes of the 1950s.

Consider Middleton, Idaho, where elementary teachers electronically amplify their voices in all-boys classrooms but not in girls classrooms, based on absurd extrapolations about male-female hearing differences. Middleton teachers also reportedly encourage boys to run and play before exams, whereas girls are led in calming yoga exercises based on fabricated differences in their brains stress response systems.


Gender segregation has been allowed to flourish for nearly a decade in U.S. public schools. The good news is that the Department of Educations Office for Civil Rights has finally taken notice, and this week it issued guidelines to prevent schools from using biological differences as a basis for teaching boys and girls differently. The departments guidance may be the first step toward battling back the gender distortions that have flooded K-12 education for years now.


    Advertisement




For instance, the busy boys and little ladies title comes from teacher training materials in Florida, a hotbed for single-sex classrooms and whose teachers are mandated by law to receive professional development in gender and education. This doesnt sound like a bad idea, until you learn that school districts are basing their training on the gender musings of Michael Gurian, a pop psychologist who lacks any training in neuroscience or education. In the Hillsborough district that includes Tampa, nearly $100,000 of taxpayer money has gone to the Gurian Institute and other trainers, who advocate blatantly stereotypical practices salted with just enough distorted claims about the brain and hormones to fool teachers into thinking they are scientifically based.



If separate and unequal classrooms sound illegal, its because they probably are.



Heres a typical brain-sex factoid touted by Gurian: Boys come out of the womb with a formatting for non-verbal, spatial, kinesthetic activity on the right side of the brain. In the areas where girls brains come out ready to use words, boys brains come out ready to move around, kick and jump.


It all sounds so sensibleright on target with most gender stereotypes and therefore perfect justification for educating boys and girls differently. Except that none of it is true! There is no differential formatting of boys and girls brains, and no difference in the brain areas men and women dedicate to verbal or spatial abilities. Nor does testosteronethe favorite go-to hormone for Gurian and other gender segregationistsramp up boys math skills or suppress their language development, as teachers in Florida have also heard in their training.


Its bad enough to see teachers amplifying gender stereotypes, but its truly distressing to hear students themselves parrot false beliefs about boys and girls brains and abilities. In Tampa, a pair of single-sex middle schools, Ferrell and Franklin Academies, actually posts home page videos of girls boasting about their superior frontal lobes and ability to read facial expressions and boys expounding on their brains better visual and spatial processing.The implication of girls or boys articulating, respectively, Were good at emotion or Were good at spatial processing is the unspoken, but powerful corollary: and were bad at thinking or were bad at talking.


If separate and unequal classrooms sound illegal, its because they probably are. The Department of Educations action was triggered by several complaints, including some filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged single-sex programs in Florida, Texas, and other states. The move is part of the groups larger Teach Kids, Not Stereotypes campaign that urges stronger enforcement of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.


Title IX regulations expressly forbid single-sex education that is based on overly broad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of either sex. With its new guidance, the Department of Education appears to finally agree that these pseudoscientific claims about boys and girls hearing, vision, stress response, and cognitive abilities qualify as overly broad. The problem with such generalizations is that there are plenty of boys and girls who dont conform to themgirls who are very physical or good at math, and boys who are very sensitive or good at readingand are therefore being marginalized in such environments.


Of course, not all single-sex schools rely on brain sex differences for justification. But as Rebecca Bigler and I wrote earlier in Slate, the very fact of segregation of any type accentuates group differences. In children, especially, research finds that gender segregation exaggerates their beliefs in hardwired, immutable differences between the sexes. So while girls or boys may love their single-sex classes and even feel temporarily empowered in them, the loss of opportunity to work with members of the other sex ultimately fosters a distorted belief in gender difference that restricts all childrens potential.


Considerable research has now proven that single-sex education does not produce better academic outcomes than co-education. Which raises the question: Why have gender segregation at all in K-12 schools? We live in a diverse, pluralistic society, where schools need to better prepare boys and girls to work together, raise families together, and share leadership in the future. Most Americans now abhor racial segregation in schools, and by similar logic, gender segregation seems a poor way forward for todays young people, especially when justified by pseudoscience.

Slate,L,Map of juvenile delinquents: DC map from 1935 showing homes of juvenile offenders. ,"The Vault isSlate's history blog. Like us onFacebook, follow us on Twitter@slatevault, and find us onTumblr.Find out more about what this space is all abouthere.

This 1936 map of Washington, D.C. pinpoints residencies that had produced kids recently designated juvenile delinquents. The data for the map came from the District of Columbias Juvenile Court. The red marks on the map, which look similar from afar, are shaped differently: Stars mean white girls; squares are for white boys; circles indicate colored girls; and triangles denote colored boys.


Those responsible for printing this D.C. map may have been responding to recent work by Clifford R. Shaw, a sociologist whose book Delinquency Areas (1929) tracked 60,000 Chicago youths, mapping their addresses and trying to understand how the geography of the city might be contributing to truancy, delinquency, and criminality.

McKay believed that the presence of clusters of delinquents in certain areas of the citylower-income neighborhoods that were close to industry and commerceindicated that it was environment, and not personality, that caused delinquency. Evaluating an updated version of their work in 1942, Shaw and McKay wrote:


It would appear from the findings of this study that successful treatment of the problem of delinquency in large cities will entail the development of programs that will seek to effect changes in the conditions of life  Diagnosis and supervision of individual offenders probably will not be sufficient to achieve this end.


Since the time of Shaws and McKays work, contemporary sociologists have taken issue with their geographical approachs inability to tell us more about the culture of the neighborhoods being assessed, or about the lives of the nondelinquent kids who lived there.

Slate,L,"Law school solvency: Why I just bet a professor money that at least one law school will close.
","In a more fair universe, the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego would be dead and buried by now. One of the more wretched citizens of legal academy, the small, private institution is known for its miserable employment results and embarrassing bar-passage rates, as well as for having the most highly indebted students of any law school in the country (the average graduate with debt finishes $180,665 in the hole, according to U.S. News & World Report).

It's hard reading her make excuses for his behavior and hard reading her blame herself. It's hard reading about how much she lives in his world, which no doubt makes it that much harder to imagine life without him. It's hard reading about how Ray Rice put his wife in a position to comfort him and tiptoe around him, like he was the victim, mere hours after the incident. But it is important reading, if you want to understand the dynamics of domestic abuse and really get answers to that perennial question of why she stays.

Slate,L,"We don't need to ban frats to reduce rape rates, but it might help to integrate women into them.","The shocking story of a fraternity house gang rape at the University of Virginia published by Rolling Stone last monthcaused the school to temporarily suspend all the frats on campus, and it reopened the discussion about whether fraternities are an outdated institution that should be ended altogether. As Jay Hathaway at Gawker noted in his call to ban frats, ""The events reported in that story are an especially gruesome version of an act that is far too common at America's fraternitiesaccording to a 2007 study, men who enter fraternities are three times as likely to commit rape as their fellow students who do not."" It makes sense that these archaically single-sex organizations would magnify already existing problems stemming from sexism, so it would follow that ending this tradition would do a lot of good.

Slate,L,"Sabrina Rubin Erdely, UVA: Why didnt a Rolling Stone writer talk to the alleged perpetrators of a gang rape?","The Rolling Stone piece A Rape on Campus is a huge story in all senses of the word. It is long and expansive, documenting a culture at the University of Virginia that seems to shrug off sexual assault. It has also helped kick off a broad national conversation about fraternity culture, rape on campus, and whether our colleges and universities are equipped to adjudicate alleged sex crimes. At its heart, though, Sabrina Rubin Erdelys article is about a single event: an orchestrated gang rape of a woman named Jackie. In the course of 9,000 words, Erdely chronicles an administrations tepid response to a terrible crime. But what the piece is missing is one small thing: that single, standard sentence explaining that the alleged perpetrators of the crime deny it, or dont deny it, or even that they could not be reached for comment. Its often a boring sentence, one that comes off as boilerplate to readers, but its absolutely necessary, because it tells readers you tried your best to get the other side of the story. You notice when it isnt there.

Last week, we invited Erdely on the DoubleX Gabfest to talk about the story. I asked her in several different ways if she knew anything about the seven men whom Jackie accused of committing this crime, or if she had talked to them. In the story, Jackies roommate at the time, Rachel Soltis, tells Erdely, Me and several other people know exactly who did this to her. Jackie says she still sees Drew, the guy she alleges orchestrated the gang rape, walking around campus sometimes. (Jackie is the alleged victims real first name. Drew is Erdelys pseudonym for the alleged perpetrator.) Drew was on Jackies lifeguard shift at the university pool. Hes a junior and a member of the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. An open campus is relatively friendly terrain for a reporter, and students email addresses arent difficult to track down. He couldnt be that hard to find. And yet, based on Erdelys answers, we couldnt tell how hard shed tried.


I reached out to them in multiple ways. They were kind of hard to get in touch with because [the fraternitys] contact page was pretty outdated. But I wound up speaking  I wound up getting in touch with their local president, who sent me an email, and then I talked with their sort of, their national guy, whos kind of their national crisis manager. They were both helpful in their own way, I guess.

If you want to hear Erdely talk about this and more, you can listen to her complete interview on the DoubleX Gabfest:





Erdelys editor at Rolling Stone, Sean Woods, has confirmed that the writer did not talk to Drew or any of the men that Jackie alleges participated in the rape. We did not talk to them. We could not reach them, he told the Washington Post, although he added that the magazine verified their existence by talking to Jackies friends. Im satisfied that these guys exist and are real, he said. We knew who they were.


In her story, Erdely does describe a scene in which Jackies three best friends on campus encounter her immediately after the alleged incident. The way Erdely writes that scene, its impossible to know if shes getting the quotes directly from the friends (whose names have been changed in the story) or from Jackies recollection of what they said. Mostly, it seems to be the latter. Here, they discuss whether they should take Jackie to the hospital:


Their other two friends, however, werent convinced. Is that such a good idea? she recalls Cindy asking. Her reputation will be shot for the next four years. Andy seconded the opinion, adding that since he and Randall both planned to rush fraternities, they ought to think this through.


We dont hear how Cindy recalls that same conversation, one that is pretty damning to Cindy.


Both Erdely and Woods have said that they decided to tell the story mostly from Jackies point of view. As Woods told the Post, We were telling Jackies story. Its her story.



Erdely was in a tough position. Push too hard and she might lose Jackie. But not pushing harder has created a whole new nightmare.



In that same Post piece, Erdely seems protective of Jackie. She said that she did not identify the men in the article by Jackies request. She asked me not to name the individuals because shes so fearful of them. That was something we agreed on. Erdely would not say, however, whether she knew who they were. I cant answer that, she told the Post. This was a topic that made Jackie extremely uncomfortable.


Erdely is a very accomplished magazine writer. She has written about many difficult subjects before, including an OB-GYN who was convicted of fondling his patients. (She didnt talk to him either, but she did include a sentence saying he could not be reached for comment. Plus, he had already been convicted.) She must know the basic rules of reporting a story like this: You try very, very hard to reach anyone youre accusing of something. You use any method you can think of, including the jerk reporter move of making a surprise, in-person confrontation. (Sarah Koenig, the host of the Serial podcast, provides a good example of reporter due diligence.) You try especially hard if you are writing about something as serious as a gang rape accusation. Sometimes, what results is a more layered version of the truth. Sometimes, the answer you get makes the accused seem even guiltier (e.g., Bill Cosby, asserting through a lawyer, that all the dozens of accusations against him are fabricated).


If you fail to reach the person, you write a sentence explaining that you triedand explaining how you triedas a way to assure your readers that you gave the person a chance to defend themselves. Were not sure why Rolling Stone didnt think that was necessary.




Why arent we sure what Rolling Stone thought? Here is our standard sentence: I emailed and called Erdely to ask her some follow-up questions after she appeared on the DoubleX Gabfest, but she sent me to Rolling Stones public relations person. Woods, her editor, said he was done talking about the story and sent a statement from Rolling Stone that read, in part, Through our extensive reporting and fact-checking, we found Jackie to be entirely credible and courageous and we are proud to have given her disturbing story the attention it deserves.


It could be that Erdely did try her hardest to reach the alleged rapists. Or it could be that she didnt, out of deference to Jackie. Weve interviewed many of Jackies friends, including some who were quoted in the Rolling Stone story. They verified that Jackie did get very upset when Erdely wanted to find out more about the alleged assailants. Sara Surface, a good friend of Jackies and a member of One Less, a victim advocacy group at UVA, had the impression that Jackies reaction was extreme when Erdely pressed hermeaning that Jackie became so terrified that she reconsidered going public with her story, even anonymously. If thats true, then Erdely was in a tough position. Push too hard and she might lose Jackie. But not pushing harder has created a whole new nightmare.


Various writers and media outlets have now started to pick apart Erdelys reporting, as well as the details of Jackies story as reported by Rolling Stone. Thats because, even by the standards of horrific, despicable frat behavior, this story stands out. Jackie, who says she was sober, was allegedly led upstairs by her date into a dark room, where seven men allegedly raped her as others egged them on. She tells Erdely that she was smashed into a glass coffee table and raped by a beer bottle. Drew, who had invited her to the frat party as his date, allegedly stood by and orchestrated the whole thing. When he later ran into Jackie, she says that he told her hed had a great time. Thats not expected behavior even by the standards of rapists. Thats psychotic.


Caitlin Flanagan, who did an investigation into bad behavior at fraternities for the Atlantic, emailed us:


In all my time studying fraternity rapes for my own essay, I didnt come across a single report of anything like this.I did find reports of women who were raped by multiple men on one nightbut those always involved incapacitation, either by alcohol or a drugged drink.And I did also find accounts of violent, push-down rape of the kind in the essaybut those were always by one member, not a bunch of members.(In fact, many of that kindnow that I think about itwere committed by non-members, or by visiting former members).But a planned gang rape, without alcohol or drugs, and keyed to initiationI have never seen a case like that.Nor have I seen penetration with a foreign objectIve seen plenty of that committed by brothers to pledges as hazing, but I havent seen it in sexual assault cases.Im sure its happened, but againas part of a ritualized gang rape ... Never anything like it.


To be clear, just because Flanagan hasnt heard of anything like this before doesnt mean it didnt happen exactly as Jackie describes. But with a story this extreme, you want the assurance that a journalist did everything she possibly could to verify its accuracy. Whats at stake here is not just a small point of journalistic standards. As Flanagan pointed out to us in her email, if the story doesnt check out, it is going to cause so much trouble in the area of reforming fraternity sexual assault, I cant even tell you. At the moment, there is significant pressure to enact those reforms. At a faculty meeting on Tuesday, UVA President Teresa Sullivan said she is considering having both the Charlottesville and the university police do a joint patrol of the fraternities, as well as holding more classes on Fridays. For her part, Flanagan has recently been invited to speak to a large gathering of fraternity advisers about addressing fraternity rape. Inviting her, she says, is a huge opening in their thinking. But if this turns out to be a hoax, it is going to turn the clock back on their thinking 30 years.


We found Jackie and she agreed to talk to us. Then, at the last minute she backed out. She had already been interviewed by the Washington Post for a story that has not yet run, and she had picked up that the media had some doubtssomething that she is understandably sensitive to. What became clear from talking to Jackies supporters at UVA is that the community of victim advocates operates by a very specific code. The first thing as a friend we must say is, I believe you and I am here to listen,  says Brian Head, president of UVAs all-male sexual assault peer education group One in Four.Head and others believe that questioning a victim is a form of betrayal, because it will make her feel judged and all the more reluctant to ever speak about what happened. None of the people we spoke to had asked Jackie who the men were, and in fact none of them had any idea. They did not press her on any details about the incident.


A lot of the reason why we arent questioning Jackie urgently about who the names are or anything like that is because our role as advocates and friends is really just to support the survivor, says Alexandria Pinkleton, another member of One Less and a friend of Jackies who was also quoted in the Rolling Stone story. If she doesnt want to give us the names, thats not something were going to press her for. This is a point of tension between Erdely and the activists, one that is apparent in her conclusion. Erdely blames the UVA administration, which chose not to act on her allegations in any way. The activists, however, think the administration was correct not to pressure Jackie into pressing charges before she was ready.


We agree with Erdely here. If a college administrator hears about a gang rape, the first thing she should do is call the police. The irony here is that Erdely fell into the same trap as UVA administrators: They both deferred to the victims sensitivities to such an extent that they failed to out the alleged rapists.


The university told us it has asked the Charlottesville Police Department to investigate the alleged incident described in Erdelys article. So far there havent been any public confirmations or denials. There may never be. Jackie is firm in her story, and its hard to prove that something didnt happen. An interview with the alleged perpetrators wouldnt necessarily constitute proof either way. What it would provide is additional data, information that could help us assess what might have happened in that fraternity house.


At the end of that interview on the DoubleX Gabfest, I asked Erdely how she might defend Jackie in courtwhat evidence she would present if the case went to trial. Erdely said she wasnt a lawyer but given the degree of her trauma, theres no doubt in my mind that something happened to her that night. What exactly happened I dont know. I wasnt in that room. I dont know. Thats the worst part of being a reporter. You are often not in the room. But in this case, seven other people allegedly were. Where are they?

Slate,L,Football on Thanksgiving: How the Dallas Cowboys ruined Turkey Day.,"This morning, like all mornings, the dog-walking ritual led past the house where Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry and his family had lived during most of whats now known, almost exclusively, as his storied tenure.

Spacious home, circular drive out front, guest house in the back. Perhaps it is because the man who lived on the corner was named, I swear to God, Edgar Allan Poe, but the old Landry homestead whispers of stories from those thrilling days of yesterday. And this particular week, I feel compelled to say to the dog, Look there, Rambo. You know used to live there? The man who ruined Thanksgiving. Thats who.


In fairness to Landry, the Thanksgiving gambit wasnt his idea. Yes, Landry was the chief tactical officer of the greatest sports-marketing taskforce of its era. But it was general manager Tex Schramm, a former employee of CBS Sports, who in 1966 recognized that an annual home game on Turkey Day could help transform his young franchise into Americas Team.


    Advertisement




Flashback: Thanksgiving, 1966. I was writing for the Fort Worth Press at the time. Earlier that year, the wife of Cleveland Browns quarterback Frank Ryan had ventured into the public print and referred to his Cowboys counterpart, Don Meredith, as a loser. Would the allure of a football gameone preceded by those fighting wordsdraw certain men to abandon their loved ones on a holiday occasion? Well, 80,259 fans showed up at the Cotton Bowl, the most ever to see a game in Dallas. Every seat was occupied, and the aisles were jammed. The Cowboys, who at that point had yet to have a winning season, beat the mighty Cleveland Browns 26-14, and throughout the last quarter everyone was chanting, Ryan is a loser! Dallas was en route to its initial division championship, and the frothing Thanksgiving multitudes anointed pro sports new megateam.


About two hours after the game, Meredith himself materialized in a well-known honky-tonk just south of downtown called Dewey Grooms Longhorn Ranch. It was Thanksgiving night, the joint was packed, and Dandy Don wanted to be seen. He had, in tow, a man with dark hair trimmed Ward Cleaver-style, a fellow who looked almost Pentecostal in his plain dark suit, white shirt, and narrow black tie. I recognized him as a promising songwriter and struggling singer named Willie Nelson. Enriched with holiday cheer, I approached Nelson and assured him that superstardom lurked just ahead. Although he does not remember the occasion, it provided the foundation of his career.


At the conclusion of the evening, one factor emerged, blazingly evident: The face of the traditional Thanksgiving in North Texas had just undergone a massive makeover.


The Texas-Texas A&M rivalry had been a Thanksgiving staple since the advent of nationally televised college games. People cared about the game, sure, but the college game was usually over before 3 oclock.


But the Cowboys, the all-new, chrome-plated muscle car of the NFLthey were going to have a bigger impact on Dallas-Fort Worth Thanksgivings than the discovery of alcohol would have on St. Patricks Day. And the resultsand the 3:15 p.m. CST annual kickoffhave not been entirely rewarding. The football game dictates what time people are supposed to show up and what time you serve them the meal. Its too early for a lot of people and too late for the rest, and all too often youre stuck with guests who are unfit for the highway. Put the food out in the middle of the first quarter and youll set the table for a Thanksgiving parade, with various guests getting up and looking into the den to check on the score.


The natural solution to the mealtime quandary has been to turn the sit-down affair into a tailgate party. Begin early. Ideally, have a nephew on leave from the Coast Guard whos willing to tend bar. The football aspect has warped Thanksgiving in this region to the point that the success of the family interchange relies mostly on the outcome of the game. I assume that family counselors, emergency rooms, and divorce lawyers see business skyrocket when the Cowboys lose on Thanksgiving.


Sometimes even the most innocent remark can spoil the whole weekend. From past years, I hear the voice of a 7-year-old child. Mom, the voice says. After the Cowboys lost, Dad was in the kitchen and he said the fuck-word and Grandma heard him. Mom issues Dad a look of, to be charitable, profound dismay. Unkind remarks ensue, and by the conclusion of the evening, Dad could show Tiger Woods a thing or two about a hard luck Thanksgiving  all because Dallas chose to lose.


The worst was the Great White Apocalypse of 1993. Thanksgiving brought two things to town: the Miami Dolphins and a North Dakotaquality blizzard. The playing field was coated with ice and sleet. The Dolphins last-gasp field goal effort was partially blocked, ending the game. Well, it would have ended the game, but Dallas Leon Lett for some reason decided to skid into the ball, kicking it free. The Dolphins recovered, kicked the winning field goal, and won the game.

What bonehead stuff. TV sets throughout the region did not survive the festivities, having been kicked by grown men and struck by glass containers. Worse, the ice was so deep and solid that guests were trapped. Driving, even to the corner bottle shop, was unthinkable. So now the host was stuck with the demanding in-law and the surly stepkid though Thursday night  Friday  Saturday  and finally the roads were cleared on Sunday. The thing that kept us all from murdering each other, remembers one survivor of the shittiest freeze in Texas football history, was the unification that came from our mutual contempt of Leon Lett.


So Ill walk past the Landry house on Thanksgiving morning and try to pick up on his aura. With the Eagles in Arlington on Thursday, the mood of the Cowboys fan is drifting dangerously close to the rapture zone. Common sense paranoia suggests a Thanksgiving ambush. The occasion seems to call for cocktails about a half hour before kickoff. Maybe those Coast Guard Bloody Marys my nephew used to prepare: ample portions of PGA (pure grain alcohol) and dill pickle juice to mitigate the low-rent taste. Three of those, and you can experience post-game aches and pains, just like the real players do. It's Texas Thanksgiving tradition.

By October 2013, students were regularly hacking the tablets to play games and browse the Web.


But in October 2014, L.A. schools superintendent John Deasy resigned amid accusations that he didnt disclose close relationships with Apple and Pearson executives. As if things werent already looking bad for the $1.3 billion project, the FBI is now investigating it.


    Advertisement




As the Los Angeles Times reports, school officials gave 20 boxes worth of documents related to the iPad initiative to the FBI, per a grand jury subpoena. The investigation is mainly looking at talks and evaluations that went on before bidding started for the L.A. school districts iPad contract. The subpoena calls for score sheets; complete notepads, notebooks and binders; reports; contracts; agreements; consent forms; files; notices; agenda; meetings notes and minutes; instructions; accounting records and other records.



The investigation seems to be looking for inappropriate relationships and dealings that might have influenced the bidding process. Were not going to use the original iPad contract anymore, saidRamon C. Cortines, the current school superintendent. There have been too many innuendos, rumors, etc. He says the plan to suspend the contract was agreed upon before the FBI search.


The iPad program has been mired in controversy since its conception, with critics pointing out its huge cost and dubious contribution to daily learning. Before the 20142015 school year even began, Deasy had suspended the contract with Apple and Pearson to potentially redo the bidding process. Now it seems like the contract is really dead. Again.

Slate,L,Young v. UPS: The Supreme Court takes up pregnant workers rights.,"For those of us still sitting shiva for abortion clinic buffer zones and the contraceptive coverage mandate, it might feel too soon to point out the brand new landmines awaiting women in the Supreme Courts current term. But on Wednesday, the court will hear arguments in another case involving the reproductive lives of Americas female workersthis one interpreting the scope of the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act, or PDA. Given this courts track record, advocates for gender equalitysorry, Justice Alito, no quotation marks for meare hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.


In order to continue earning a paycheck while pregnant, many women will need their employers to make some adjustments.



The case, Young v. UPS, comes from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and concerns Peggy Young, who worked as a driver for the courier service in Landover, Maryland. Young became pregnant in 2006 and was instructed by her medical provider, as many pregnant women are, to avoid lifting more than 20 pounds. Young rarely had to deliver packages that heavy, but UPS refused to excuse her from those duties, or to reassign her for the remainder of her pregnancy to a light duty job. UPS had a policy allowing such temporary reassignments but limited them to three circumstances, none of which applied to pregnancy: when a workers impairment was due to an on-the-job injury, qualified her for reasonable accommodation under the Americans With Disabilities Act (which typically does not include a normal pregnancy), or had caused her to lose her commercial drivers license.


Unwilling to disregard her doctors directive, Young had to go on unpaid leave. At that point, she was just 14 weeks pregnant. She ultimately went without pay for six months and lost her medical coverage before having her baby because she didnt work the number of hours UPS required to maintain those benefits.


    Advertisement




Youngs story is increasingly typical. Women now constitute close to half the workforce, and three-quarters of them will be pregnant at least once during their working lives. Most pregnant women stay on the job right up until their due dates; according to a U.S. Census Bureau study, in the past 50 years, the number of women working into their ninth month more than doubled, with a whopping 82 percent of women who gave birth between 2006 and 2008 working into their final month of pregnancy. Coupled with these demographic realities are pregnancys medical realities: Even an uncomplicated pregnancy can cause nausea, migraines, urinary tract infections, carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and chronic fatigue while more serious conditions include diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, placenta previa, and pre-eclampsia. For women in jobs that involve prolonged standing (retail clerks, cashiers), are physically strenuous or dangerous (firefighters, law enforcement officers), or include contact with toxic materials (janitors, hotel housekeepers), pregnancy can be in direct conflict with their ability to work. Simply put, in order to continue earning a paycheck while pregnant, many women will need their employers to make some adjustments.


Many, like UPS, resist doing so. Some of these employers are household names (Walmart, Pier One, Old Navy, Kroger), and others youve probably never heard of (Fierman Produce Exchange, Unique Thrift, the city of Florence, Kentucky). A joint report published in 2013 by the National Womens Law Center and A Better Balance noted that even seemingly easy fixes, like allowing a woman to carry a water bottle or to sit down periodically, have been denied time and again. Indeed, a recent study by the National Partnership for Women & Families estimates that more than 250,000 women a year have their accommodation requests denied. These women are left with the Hobsons choice of risking their pregnancies or losing their jobs. While Young was lucky enough to keep hersafter her three months of Family and Medical Leave Act leave ran out, she was allowed to take an extended leave of absence, albeit unpaid, under the terms of her union contractcountless others are simply fired for absenteeism. In either case, for an expectant mother to lose a paycheck just as shes about to have another mouth to feed is a devastating outcome.


This has been going on for years. Whats new is that women are increasingly turning to the courts, accounting in part for an explosion of pregnancy discrimination charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that enforces the PDA, and its state counterparts. Charges filed with those agencies increased by nearly 50 percent between 1997 and 2011, and recent statistics confirm that women in low-wage and nontraditional jobs are filing most of those claims.


Under the PDA, employers are required to treat pregnant women the same as workers who are similar in their ability or inability to work. Young argued that because UPS accommodated workers with physical limitations other than pregnancythat is, it granted light duty to workers who were similar to Young in their inability to perform all job functionsthen it violated the PDA by refusing to grant the same to her. But the trial judge dismissed Youngs case and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that dismissal, for two reasons. First, because UPSs policy didnt specifically state a bias against pregnant workers, then it wasnt deemed discriminatory. And second, the court reasoned that Young actually wasnt similar to any of those three categories of workers to whom UPS granted accommodation, so she wasnt entitled to be treated the same as they were.


The first rationale has been followed by a number of other courts, and is patently wrong. To explain why requires a brief detour into the history of why the PDA was passed in the first place. Congress enacted the law in 1978 as a direct rebuke to a recent Supreme Court decision finding that General Electrics policy of excluding pregnancy benefits from its employees disability plan did not discriminate against women, even though only women can get pregnant so only women were harmed by the policy.* In the courts memorable words, a distinction between pregnant women and non-pregnant persons was a distinction based on a particular medical condition, not gender. Voilno sex discrimination.




It was precisely this specious distinction that Congress rejected in passing the PDA two years later. It recognized that when a pregnant employee is denied benefits granted to other employees, its sex discrimination, even in the absence of a stated bias against pregnant workers.


The 4th Circuits second rationalethat Peggy Young was not entitled to a light duty assignment because she was not similar to others who did get themexposes a fundamental limitation in the PDA as currently written: A pregnant worker gets an accommodation only if other employees with comparable impairments get them, too. The 4th Circuit and other courts have ignored the statutes built-in definition of whos comparablethose similar in their ability or inability to workinstead requiring that the other employees be similar to the pregnant worker in all respects. So a worker who is accommodated because of an on-the-job injury, or an ADA-qualifying disability, or a lost commercial drivers license, is not similar to a pregnant worker. Thus, the pregnant worker cant seek the same accommodation.


Without a court remedy, retooling the PDA itself is another strategy: The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act has been introduced each year in Congress since 2012 and would establish an independent right of accommodation for pregnancythat is, a right that doesnt tether pregnant workers fates to their co-workers. Nine states and some municipalities already have some version of the PWFA, but those laws assist a fraction of the women who need their protections.


Whatever the outcome in Young, clarity cant come soon enough. UPS did its part to muddy the waters by announcing in its Supreme Court brief, filed in late October, that it had changed its accommodation policy to include pregnancy, though that backtracking comes too late to help Young. (UPS claims it made the change not because the PDA requires it but just to make the companys life easier as it becomes subject to the patchwork of new state and local accommodation laws.) Meanwhile, even employers who purport to want to do the right thing get it wrong. For instance, after pressure from a coalition of female employees, female shareholders, and womens rights groups, including the filing of a class-action complaint with the EEOC, Walmart announced in the spring that it was changing its policy regarding pregnancy accommodation. But while the company abandoned its Young-like position that pregnant women never are entitled to the same modifications as ADA-protected workers, its new policy only applies to those pregnant women deemed disableda definition thats left up to Walmart to determine in each case. Its far from certain whether someone like Peggy Young, who sought relief from heavy lifting to preserve a healthy pregnancy, would qualify; both advocates and Walmart employees are agitating for the company to revise the policy further.


Meanwhile, the chorus supporting Peggy Young is getting louder. In July, the EEOC issued a new enforcement guidance on pregnancy discrimination that roundly criticized the Young court and its ilk as misconstruing the PDA. It also joined a friend of the court brief submitted by the federal government in Young urging reversal of the 4th Circuits ruling. A number of prominent womens groups have filed similar briefs, as have federal, state, and local legislators, law professors, female business leaders, labor unions, and even a coalition of anti-abortion organizations (who contend, accurately, that without on-the-job accommodation, some desperate women will have abortions so that they can keep working). 


Of course, when it comes to this Supreme Courts take on women, pregnancy, and employment rights, there is good reason to think its decision in Young will only make things worse. But, as illustrated by the infamous Lilly Ledbetter pay discrimination decision in 2007which prompted a swift rebuttal from Congress in the form of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Actnot to mention the PDA itself, enacted to nullify the General Electric ruling, sometimes lawmakers best motivation comes from a disaster in the judiciary. If the court upholds the 4th Circuits narrow, wrongheaded reading of the PDA, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act might finally get traction.


Regardless of whether resolution comes from the court or Congress, its about time that we acknowledge that pregnancy is a major medical event for working women, and some womens job duties may conflict with pregnancys physical effects. Without some collective commitment to making the temporary accommodations necessary for those women to continue working safely, then were committing to a future full of Peggy Youngswomen whose pregnancies cost them their paychecks.


*Correction, Dec. 3, 2014: This article originally misstated that General Electric once had a policy of excluding pregnancy benefits from its employees' medical plans. It was not their medical plans, but their disability plans. (Return.)

Slate,L,Google Tax: The UK cracks down on multinational companies shifting profits and taxes abroad.,"On Wednesday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced to Parliament the creation of a new diverted profits taxor, colloquially, a ""Google tax.""Set to take effect in April 2015, the 25 percent tax is designed to keep companies from exploiting loopholes to dodge taxes on profits they make in the United Kingdom.

Google's U.K. operation is notorious for paying relatively little tax on the piles of money it makes there. In May 2013, a special report in Reuters showed how Google funneled its U.K. sales through Ireland to escape local tax liability. From 2006 to 2011, Google generated $18 billion in revenue from the U.K., Reuters reported, but paid only $16 million in taxes. Despite running most of its operations in London, Google for tax purposes claimed not to have a presence in the U.K.

The new tax doesn't just target Google, but also pressures other companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks to pay their taxes locally instead of shifting them to lower-tax markets overseas. Obsorne told Parliament that the Google tax has the potential to raise about $475 million a yearcertainly not nothing, but also not terribly much compared with the U.K.'s budget deficit of 91.6 billion pounds (or roughly $143.9 billion).


The ""Google tax"" is the latest effort by governments to stop multinational corporations from going to great lengths to avoid paying taxes. Another such measure, the ever-popular tax inversion, was a topic of much debate this summer after Burger King said it was set to purchase Tim Hortons in what appeared an effort to shift its headquarters to Canada to escape the high U.S. corporate tax rates.

Slate,L,Stephanie Diani: Live Audience! Looks at the people who attend multiple television tapings (PHOTOS).,"During her years living in Los Angeles, Stephanie Diani was intrigued whenever she passed the long lines of people waiting to get into television show tapings. She wanted to create a series that spoke to the diehard aspect of being serial studio audience members. 

It just seemed so Hollywood and sad and funny, and I always wanted to shoot them and I could never figure out how to do it, she said.


When Diani decided to follow through on a lifelong dream and leave L.A. for Manhattan, she quickly put out a casting call for people who had been to at least four tapings to create the series Live Audience! Diani decided to recreate the studio audience effect and photographed her subjects using studio lights. She gave them direction about what to wear as well as instructions to act out specific emotions for fake television shows, similar to what they would hear from directors during tapings.

During the tapings, they really orchestrate the audience, she said. They take you through emotions before the show starts, then tape the show and get actual reactions but they use both [in the final edit]. I decided to take these people through fake scenarios that showed extreme emotion.


She photographed about 18 people in one day and then edited them to show one larger image with little expression paired with four smaller images that show a wide range of more exaggerated emotion. She also asked each person to write a one-sentence biography and to list all of the shows for which they had been part of the studio audience.

Slate,L,Sam Hinkie: Is the Philadelphia 76ers lose-on-purpose approach to team-building ingenious or morally bankrupt?,"Sometime during the last 18 months, the Philadelphia 76ers ceased being a basketball team and became an avant-garde, vaguely basketball-ish idea. It might have happened in June 2013, when the Sixers traded All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday for a draft pick they used on promising but injured center Nerlens Noel, whom they then shelved for the entire 2013-14 season. It might have happened in February 2014, when they shipped out Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes at the trade deadline for a motley assemblage of journeymen, second-round draft picks, and one former All-Star (Danny Granger), who was immediately jettisoned, lest his basket-making skills infect his new teammates with the ability to win NBA games. Or maybe it happened this June, when the Sixers used the third pick of the 2014 draft on Joel Embiid, another injured center who may or may not play this year, thus ensuring that a team that had lost an NBA-record-tying 26 consecutive games in 2013-14 somehow found a way to not improve.

Whatever else you want to say about them, you cant accuse the 2014-15 Philadelphia 76ers of failing to meet expectations. They are on pace to be the worst team in NBA history according to a variety of statistical indicators, the harshest being their win-loss record: Philly currently sits at 0-10, having lost those 10 games by an average of 16.9 points. In Mondays loss to the Spurs, the Sixers came out with a starting five of Tony Wroten, Hollis Thompson, Luc Mbah a Moute, Brandon Davies, and Henry Sims. It is not an exaggeration to say that none of them would start for any other NBA team. (Except maybe the Lakers. Probably the Lakers.) The Sixers best player is Michael Carter-Williams, a big and talented point guard who was last seasons Rookie of the Year, which means that everyone assumes the Sixers are trying to trade him. Their highest-paid player is Jason Richardson, an aging guard who hasnt appeared in an NBA game in nearly two years. (Richardson is one of only two players on the roster who is older than 25.) The Sixers employ a small forward who wears number 99 and a point guard who wears number 88, perhaps in homage to seldom-used Eagles wide receiver Jeff Maehl, although probably not.


If you do not follow the NBA, you might be surprised to learn that the man who assembled this team has not been fired. The Max Bialystock of this production is general manager Sam Hinkie, a 36-year-old stats maven whos either a genius or someone with a genius for being called a genius. Hinkie holds an MBA from Stanford, and prior to joining the Sixers in 2013 spent nearly a decade apprenticing under Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey, arguably the NBAs most prominent evangelist of statistical analysis.



Are the Hinkie haters so wrong to suggest that a basketball team should be built so as to win basketball games?



    Advertisement




Hinkie is about as far from an insider as one can find in the clubby confines of professional hoops: He played no organized basketball past high school, and before arriving in the NBA he worked for Bain Capital, in Australia. By all accounts, he is exceptionally smart, and hes nothing if not forward-thinking. In a profession where job security is as precarious as a Dwight Howard free throw, Hinkiewith the support of ownership in Philadelphiahas taken a long-game approach to roster construction thats visionary, immoral, or both.


Theres a widely held belief that the worst thing an NBA team can be is mediocre. If youre not great, then you might as well be terrible, as a horrible win-loss record is the ticket to the top of the draft lottery, where you just might find the sports next superstar. Well-managed teams realize this, and poorly run ones dont (ladies and gentlemen, your 21st-century New York Knicks!), which means that sometimes very good teams will become very bad teams, as a stepping stone to vice versa. The best recent practitioners of this badness-to-goodness approach are the Oklahoma City Thunder, whose mid-2000s run of futility (partly as the Seattle Supersonics) landed them Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, and the departed James Harden, and a renewed identity as a perennial contender.


But no organization has ever bottomed out quite as extravagantly as these Sixers, a team that drafts players who literally cannot play and trades players who can in order to draft more players who cant. What the Sixers lack in flesh-and-blood basketball talent they make up for in that most alluring buzzword of the contemporary NBA: assets. The one inconvenience of that strategy is that the 2014-2015 Philadelphia 76ers exist, albeit barely, as an ongoing professional basketball concern. While the enlightened fan can be heartened by assetsfuture draft picks, promising youngsters on team-friendly contractshe cant root for them. In the meantime, the actual humans who wear Sixers uniforms recently lost 123-70 to the Mavericks, which wasnt that bad a result considering they trailed 73-29 at halftime.




If you buy what Hinkie is selling, then that score is totally meaningless. The teams collection of future picks is vertigo-inducing. If the Sixers draft wisely, if Carter-Williams continues to develop (either as a point guard or a trade chip), if cap space can lure quality free-agent veterans, if Noel and Embiid rise to anywhere near their speculative potential, then the Sixers could have a dominant team for years to come in the not-so-intimidating Eastern Conference, and maybe quicker than anyone thinks. But thats an awful lot of ifs, and in the meantime good luck selling luxury boxes or even nosebleed seats to watch an unprotected 2017 first-round pick.


Whats most fascinating about the Sixers is that theyve literalized pro sports championship-or-bust mindset. This team is, essentially, an experiment in how much abuse fans are willing to tolerate in exchange for promises of a dynasty down the road. Philadelphians, as youd expect, are not flocking to see this gruesome science projectthe Sixers are third from the bottom in the NBA in attendance. Its asking an awful lot of fans to put money into a team that isnt trying to win, particularly when it seems content to stretch this period of intentional loserdom into something like a minor era. After all, there are words for people who abuse the patience of others, and rest assured that Sixers fans are familiar with all of them.


Philadelphia natives take their sports rather seriously, he wrote as he ducked out of the way of a battery. As to be expected, camps have formed. The pro-Hinkie side has taken the form of a half-ironic personality cult: jokily messianic memes abound, #INHINKIEWETRUST is a running hashtag, and the popular blog Liberty Ballers hosted a draft day party replete with Hinkie T-shirts. Tongue-in-cheek as much of this is, there is optimism and even excitement among a certain cadre of Sixers fans, a group that relishes being part of what is, at the very least, a bold attempt to refashion a not-so-successful franchise.


On the other end of the spectrum are old-media stalwarts like Philly sportscaster Howard Eskin, whos been known to rail against the Hinkie apologists (including his own son). Theres also ex-Sixers coach and wandering curmudgeon Larry Brown, who recently kvetched to the Philadelphia Inquirer that the Sixers dont have a basketball person in the organization. It makes me sick to my stomach. (Brown led the Sixers to their last Finals appearance in 2001 by strapping the team to the back of Allen Iverson, an electrifying guard whose shot-happy inefficiency made him, incidentally, the precise sort of player the analytics crowd is stereotyped as loathing.)


Its easy to caricature all of this as Moneyball on the hardwood, brainy progress squaring off against brawny conservatism. But are the Hinkie haters so wrong to suggest that a basketball team should be built so as to win basketball games? Theres a fine line between outside-the-box creativity and running a franchise like youre part of some obscurantist, too-clever-by-half fantasy league. While its a bit dopey to say that sports exist for the fans, the Sixers disavowal of anything like basketball aesthetics nevertheless feels like an affront.


And what if it turns out that Hinkie isnt actually the smartest guy in the room? By taking asset acquisition to its logical extreme, the Sixers may well have convinced the NBA that its current method of parceling out talent is in fact illogical. A few weeks ago, a proposal to reform the draft lottery to disincentivize tanking fell just six votes shy of passing. If significant changes are pushed through while the Sixers experiment is in progress, what now appears to be a madcap experiment could swiftly transform into a doomed basketball hellscape.

The record for futility in an 82-game season already belongs to Philadelphia, set by a 72-73 Sixers squad that went a brisk 9-73 (youll hear those numbers a lot this season). That Sixers team was awarded the top pick straightaway, and claimed as its prize future All-Star/coach/television analyst/coke-rap enthusiast Doug Collins. By 1977 they were back in the NBA Finals, after purchasing the rights to ex-ABA superstar Julius Erving.


Its impossible to say what these Sixers will look like four years from now. This year, at some point, the Sixers will win a game. It might happen on Wednesday night, when they play the rebuilding Boston Celtics, or on Saturday, when they visit the unquenchable tire fire that is the Knicks. But it wont be pretty, and a lone victory (or even 10) wont stop anyone from wondering if the Philadelphia 76ers are even dumber than they look, or ifin the words of Homer SimpsonSam Hinkie is stupid like a fox.

Slate,L,Ball Aerospace: A company known for mason jars helped with NASA's Orion capsule.,"NASAs great hope for future manned space exploration, the Orion capsule, was supposed to launch Thursday on its first test flight, but plans were scrapped because of various problems. The team will try again Friday morning. But when the capsule finally lifts off, it will bear the logos of the contractors who built it. Some of the names will be recognizable, like Lockheed Martin. Another logo will ring a bell, but it might seem out of place: the loopy script Ball embossed on mason jars the world over.

Today the 134-year-old Ball Corp. mostly makes cans: for soup and dog food, beer and soda, and aerosols. But the name is still most strongly associated with the glass jars the company became famous for. That business peaked in 1931, when Ball made 190 million jars (one for every person in the United States that year, with 66 million left over), and in 1993 the home-canning division was spun off into its own company.


    Advertisement




The capsule wont be carrying canned tuna (or a bar trying to burnish its hipster cred). Its taking instruments made by the Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., a division of Ball that pulled in about $900 million last year from contracts with NASA, the military, and other sources both public and private.*


Ball Aerospace started on a hunch. Ed Ball, son of one of the five founding Ball brothers, needed to find a way to keep his company profitable in the second half of the 20th century. The Ball company began selling tin cans for storing kerosene and went on to dominate the glass mason jar industry. By the end of World War II, with refrigeration replacing home canning, the company was scrambling. Ed proposed starting a research division to help Ball stay competitive.


Like many manufacturers, Ball had government contracts during World War II, making battery casings and other military equipment. That revenue evaporated after the war, but Ed Ball realized the new role government had taken on. In 1956, he wrote in a letter to some of his executives, I understand that there are government projects available that might help our Research Department become self-supporting much more rapidly than pulling it up by its own bootstraps.


Wanting to compete with larger corporations, but without the budget to build an in-house research department, Ed Ball did what anyone leading an aging tech giant would: He went looking for a start-up to buy. He convinced Balls board to invest in a Boulder, Colorado, company that made electronic scales for trucks.


The scale business quickly fizzled, but Balls outpost led to relationships with a group of physicists at the nearby University of Colorado. The newly formed Ball Brothers Research Corp. started hiring professors and graduate students away from the university, and their rocket-building contracts with themdrawing protest from the university president. Ed Ball was unapologetic.


It was a kind of a faith. It was an instinctive decision that this company would benefit by having a research department that could sell its own work and that could also innovate for this aging, 80 year old glass company, says Todd Neff, who wrote a book about the companys 2005 Deep Impact mission. Ball Brothers Research, later renamed Ball Aerospace, was one of the first mouths at the spigot that funds the military-industrial complex.


Within a few years, the company had won its first NASA satellite contract. It went on to build a steady stream of spacecraft and instruments. In 1975 Ball won a patent for microstrip antennas, which were thin and flexible enough to mount on the curved hull of rockets. The company soon had contracts to make antennas for nuclear missiles and fighter jets. (When the much-maligned F-35 Lightning II finally enters service next year, it will have Ball Aerospace antennas integrated into its body.)


Along the way Ball Aerospace dabbled in Geiger counters and built a machine to make plastic bottles for the Ball Corp., but its roots were in government contracts, and thats where the company found its success. Ninety-four percent of Balls business comes from government sources, with 28 percent of the total for the Pentagon and 20 percent split between NASA and NOAA. Ball Aerospace built instruments for Hubble (and fixed the telescope, too) and it is making the mirrors for Hubbles replacement, the James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in 2018.


Now Ball finds itself needing to pivot again. As [government agency] budgets have flattened over the last few years weve needed to look beyond some of our traditional markets, says John Troeltzsch, a Ball program manager. His newest project is Sentinel, a space telescope intended to spot asteroids that could threaten Earth. Sentinel is being developed and funded by a nonprofit, the B612 Foundation, which was formed by a group of former astronauts, scientists, and engineers, including at least one person who formerly worked for Ball. Troeltzsch says its the first time that a nonprofit will develop a spacecraft.


Ball is turning its eyes overseas as well. Its building a pollution-monitoring instrument for a Korean satellite, parlaying its experience as a NASA contractor. In the meantime, Ball Aerospace will continue as it has for most of its existence: overshadowed by its parent company and evocative logo, but making something a lot more exciting than mason jars.


*Correction, Dec. 4, 2014: This post originally misstated Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. as the Ball Aerospace & Technology Corp. It also stated that Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. made about $900 billion last year from contracts. It was $900 million.

Slate,L,"2014 World Series, Game 7: Should Alex Gordon have tried to dash home with the tying run?","After 29 years without a playoff berth, the Kansas City Royals went on a dream run that took them from the wild-card round to Game 7 of the World Series. And then Madison Bumgarner had to come along and spoil everything. Pitching in relief after throwing 117 pitches in Game 5, the Giants lefty threw another five scoreless innings to deliver the San Francisco Giants a 32 victory, clinching their third World Series title in five years. Bumgarner, the series MVP, has now allowed 1 earned run in 36 career World Series innings for an absurd 0.25 ERA.

While the Giants ace was close to unhittable, retiring 14 straight Kansas City hitters at one point, it wasnt easy for Bumgarner to secure the last out. With San Francisco clinging to a one-run lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, the Royals Alex Gordon slapped a sinking liner. Giants center fielder Gregor Blanco misplayed itbadly. The ball skipped past Blanco all the way to the wall, where left fielder Juan Perez tried and failed to pick it up, then recovered and heaved it back toward the infield. After all those mistakes, it seemed like a disappointment when Gordon stopped at third, just 90 feet away from tying the game.








Moments later, catcher Salvador Perez fouled out weakly to third and the second-guessing began: Should Gordon have tried to make it home?


    Advertisement




Gordon, though not a burner, is a very good base runner. His savviness on the base paths, in fact, allowed the Royals to tie the game in the second inning after he advanced to third on a fly ball to left field, then scored on a sacrifice fly to center.


With regard to that ninth-inning scamper, though, Deadspins Tim Burke makes a strong case that Gordon would have been out by a mile at home. That certainly seems true given how long it took him to make it to third base. But its worth noting that the Royals left fielder wasnt running as hard as he possibly could out of the box.


Its a rule of thumb in baseball that a good runner should make it to first base in about 4.3 seconds. Based on Foxs replays, it appears that Gordon made it to first in 4.5 seconds, then sped up once he saw the ball get past Blanco. It took Gordon around 12.2 seconds to make it to third, though he did slow down once the Royals third-base coach signaled that he shouldnt run home.


A writer named Larry Granillo started tracking home run trot times in 2010. Since then, the fastest circuit of the bases by a major leaguer was by the Dodgers Dee Gordon (no relation to Alex), who did it in 13.89 seconds. The 10 next fastest times were all under 14.66 seconds, which Gordon certainly wouldn't have matched if he'd churned his legs toward home. In fairness, even if he was running full out from the instant he made contact, it's unlikely Gordon could've raced home in the neighborhood of 14.5 seconds, though it's impossible to say what World Series adrenaline couldve brought out of him.


Back in reality: If Gordon had tried to stretch his hit into four bases, he would have been rounding the bag as the throw hit cutoff man Brandon Crawford in shallow left. That means, basically, that any decent throw cuts him down, ending the World Series. If Crawfords hypothetical toss home is horribly off line, the Royals tie the game and Kansas City goes crazy.


The smart play, then, is probably to hold Gordon at thirdput up the stop sign and give Salvador Perez a chance to drive him in. But I wish we couldve seen Gordon charging home, Crawfords throw coming in, and Buster Posey waiting at the plate. Now that would be an amazing way to decide the World Seriesand Im sure we wouldve had an amazing argument about it after Gordon (probably) got thrown out at home.

Update, Oct. 30, 2014, 3:20 p.m.:MLB.com has posted a fantastic birds-eye video that shows that Gordon never reached top speed on his ninth-inning jaunt around the bases.Andrew Simon reports that Gordons max speedof 18.7 miles per hour didnt match the top-end velocity of 20.3 miles per hour that he reached when running the bases earlier in the game.

Slate,L,"Whole Foods Detroit: Can a grocery store really fight elitism, racism, and obesity?","A couple of years ago, as winter gave way to spring, Toyoda Ruff began to think about changing how she ate. Ruff had always been heavy, but her son, Tarik, a freshman honor student, had recently crossed the 300-pound mark, prompting Ruff to ferry him to appointments at a childrens weight loss clinic, 11 miles away in Detroits Midtown neighborhood, and to document everything he ate for two months. At 270 pounds, her husband, Jermaine Harris, wanted to slim down, too. Ruff was beginning to see her familys weekly fast-food habit and visits to Golden Corrals all-you-can-eat buffet as a problem.

As Ruff mulled over these changes, a friend cajoled her into joining a healthy cooking class at their church. Ruff was on medical leave from her job as a probation officer due to an injury, and the break gave her time to consider her meals. The more she thought about eating healthy, the more intrigued she was by a new store: Whole Foods, which had just opened in Detroit. It was on the news. People were talking about it at church, Ruff said. Everybody was talking about it.


That included people outside of Detroit, too. As the city neared bankruptcy, national media questioned why a grocer derided as Whole Paychecka nod to the chains longstanding strategy of charging a premium for organic, local, and sustainable foodwould open a store there. Whole Foods answer was even more surprising: The store, said company leaders, was about social equity as much as profit.

Were coming to confront the disconnect between the accessibility and the affordability in healthy food, declared Walter Robb, the co-CEO of Whole Foods, in an early 2012 address to Detroit business leaders. There would be lower prices, too, to make the store accessible to all of Detroit. Robbs nod to the growing dietary gap between rich and poor was surprising for a man leading a company known for appealing to white, monied foodies. That April, he went even further. Addressing corporate leaders at the Milken Institute Global Conference, Robb said that at the Detroit store were going after elitism. Were going after racism. And real success, Robb told me later, would include seeing that health outcomes are being improved in Detroit.


Those were big goals for any supermarket, but they were especially a stretch for Whole Foods. First lady Michelle Obamas initiative to open new supermarkets in order to expand access to healthy foods has made it commonplace for grocers to talk about health, but it is unusual for grocers to talk about lowering prices to make healthy food more accessible. Whole Foods would almost certainly need to do that in Detroit, where more than one-third of the city lives below the poverty line. Whats more, Whole Foods central conceit as a company is that it sells only the best, healthiest foodwhich sometimes requires paying more. The Detroit store marked the grocers first big experiment testing whether lower-income shoppers like Ruffa public employee with a masters degree in social work, she is roughly middle class but sometimes struggles to pay her billswould find that line of reasoning persuasive.



Empty, savage, and foodless: This was Detroits reputation when Robb first went there.



As Whole Foods prepared to open in Detroit in June 2013 tension over the citys future was becoming palpable. Historically, racial and income inequality have broken down along the city limits, with poor, black residents in the city and rich, white residents in the suburbs, said John Patrick Leary, an assistant professor of English at Wayne State University in Detroit who frequently writes about the citys equity issues. But as middle- and upper-class residents have moved to the city while the poor stayed poor, he said, Detroit was becoming more of a normal city like Chicago or New York, where the superficial trappings of middle-class life are concentrated in a place where you can pretend youre surrounded by it. Would the store serve the audience Robb implied: the citys working class and poor, nearly all of them black, constituting the majority of the city? Or would it fall back on its base, and just serve the influx of upwardly mobile, mostly white professionals and creatives?


Before Ruffs first visit to Whole Foods last June, she wasnt sure what to expect. Usually, she shopped at Aldis, a discount store where it took a quarter to unlock a shopping cart, and entering the store required walking past an aisle stacked 6 feet high with cookies and budget wine. For produce, she went to Randazzos, a local Italian market. Ruff expected Whole Foods to be a cross between Randazzos and Sams Club. When she walked in she was surprised and overwhelmed.


Its kind of intimidating to go in there and shop, Ruff told me. I just kind of walked around, but a lot of the stuff didnt appeal to me, she said. She didnt see much differencebesides pricebetween Whole Foods groceries and what she bought at Aldis. And while many shoppers were black, as is Ruff, nearly everyone wore professional or stylish attire (or hospital scrubs); she was in a T-shirt and sweats.


Ruff was impressed, but baffled, too. She was looking for affordable, healthy food, and when she saw the salad and juice bars, the caf area, the parade of samples, they seemed excessive. That first visit to Whole Foods was like if you would go to a football game, and youve never been, and you have no clue as to what youre watching, said Ruff, who coached her sons pee wee football teams. And youre just sitting there like, What the hell is going on?

The Odd Couple



To understand what led Whole Foods to put a grocery store in Detroit, you need to understand three things: The citys reputation, its officials interest in changing it, and, most of all, Whole Foods larger aspirations.


When Robb first began eyeing Detroit in 2009, the city was mostly known for crime, abandonment, and being a place from which, as one NPR broadcast said, grocers flee. Dateline NBCs Chris Hansen compared Detroit to some ravaged foreign nation and portrayed residents hunting raccoons for food. There are more than 400 liquor stores in Detroit. But if you want to buy food, good luck, he said, addingerroneouslythat the city held just eight supermarkets, all of them discount stores. Empty, savage, and foodless: This was Detroits reputation when Robb first went there.

Indeed, Robb might never have considered opening a store in Detroit if he hadnt had lunch with Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a personal friend, on a trip to Washington, D.C., shortly after President Obamaand Vilsacktook office. Robb had been paying attention to studies around food access, and watched the first ladys initial steps around food issues with interest; maybe, he thought, Whole Foods had a role to play. When he mentioned this to Vilsack, the secretary said he had recently met with a group of black ministers from Detroit who were asking for help addressing grocery store access in their city. He offered to put Robb in touch with city officials.


Robb arrived in Detroit a few weeks later. It was January, cold and bleak, and city officials eagerly made their case as they gave him a tour. Where Robb went to Detroit to bridge the gap in food access between rich and poor, Detroits city planners saw Whole Foods as a way to not only serve its longstanding middle class, but to expand it. In short, they wanted the store to serve as a catalyst for gentrification. Whole Foods was more than a potential employer for the 15 percent of Detroiters who were unemployed (and the 46 percent whod stopped looking for work entirely); and it was more than a new option for the Detroiters spending $200 million a year on groceries outside the city. It was, in the words of the citys economic development head, a potential game-changer for the city.

Gentrification brings in revenue. Thats the tax base that we need to pay for city services, George Jackson, the president of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, told me in the summer of 2013. (After a new mayor assumed office in January 2014, Jackson resigned.) For DEGC, a quasi-public agency in charge of overseeing economic strategy for the city, Whole Foods allure was less about groceries and more about development. A successful premium grocer would make Detroit more appealing to middle-class and upper-class professionalsand to executives looking for a viable place to do businesshelping the city as a whole.


That calculation was central to the citys controversial decision to coordinate $5.8 million in public subsidies and private grants for the developer Whole Foods had selected to build the store. That was enough to bring the stores rent down to $6 a square foot, according to internal documents obtained by reporters at a local community paper, the Chaldean News (and shared with Slate). The rent, which was less than one-third of market rates last summer, served as a kind of insurance for Whole Foods, whose initial sales projections suggested that Detroit was a losing proposition. With rent that low, the store would make money even if the models were right, and sales were dismal.

The store opened in June 2013 at the southern border of Midtown, a rebranded neighborhood that used to be known as the Cass Corridor, the citys roughest skid row. Despite being in a city built for cars, the Whole Foods is an unusually walkable destination. Sitting at the corner of Mack and Woodward, it is across the street from the symphony, a block from an expanding medical complex (including Ruffs sons weight loss clinic), and a 15-minute walk from three college campuses. And, because it sits within five minutes of every freeway, it is also an easy stop for suburban commuters. From the stores entryway, you cannot see any of the nearby signs of Detroits older reputation: burned out apartment buildings and vacant lots where the homeless gather, a check cashing joint adjacent to a liquor store. One black resident of Midtown, a marketer, compared his neighborhoods relationship with the rest of the city to the protected section of Baghdad during the Iraq war. Midtown, he told me, is Detroits Green Zone.


Yet, to hear Robb tell it, Whole Foods also hoped to find customers outside the college graduates and foodies that Robbs co-CEO, the prominent libertarian John Mackey, told me make up its traditional market base. The Midtown store is the first of several that Whole Foods is opening in mixed-to-low income neighborhoods around the country; one opened in New Orleans Mid-City earlier this year, and the retailer has planned stores for Chicagos Englewood neighborhood and downtown Newark, New Jersey. When Robb and I spoke on the phone a month after the Detroit store opened, he told me the mission of this store is to serve all Detroiters, a group that would necessarily include the poor. And while Robbs story of the Detroit store tends toward lofty ideals, theres also a strong business imperative to expand the corporations customer base: an expansion goal of reaching 1,200 storesnearly triple its current countby 2020.


To succeed at Robbs goal of reaching all Detroiterswhether for idealistic reasons of equity, or savvy ones of expanding its customer baseWhole Foods needed to do more than just turn a profit. It needed to persuade a new kind of customer that what it soldlocal, organic, and sustainablewas worth seeking out. It needed, in other words, to change the food culture among the poor (or at least poorer), just as it has done among the affluent.

Apples to Apples



The second time Toyoda Ruff went to Whole Foods, she was hoping to glean a little advice. One of the biggest lessons shed taken from the cooking class at her church, she said, was that she could afford a better diet. When I took the cooking class I realized that  it doesnt always have to be so expensive to eat healthy, she said, and she was always looking for deals. So when she heard that Whole Foods was offering classes on how to shop its stores on a budget, she persuaded her friend from church, Sharon Williams, to come along.

On a pleasant August afternoon, the two women piled into Ruffs creaking Altima and drove the 11 miles from northwest Detroit to Midtown. A little after 2 p.m., they walked down a celery-green hall on the grocers second floor, passed a door marked Zen Room, and entered the classroom. Four conference tables had been pushed together, and around them sat 11 women, all but one of them black. Nearly everyone was eating the Whole Foodsbrand crudits and chips that had been set out. At the front of the room stood Amanda Musilli.



People said, well, how do you expect Detroiters to afford this?
Amanda Musilli, community liaison for Whole Foods



Our class today is about savvy shopping, she began, gesturing at a PowerPoint on a wall-mounted flatscreen television. White, trim, and plainly dressed, with long brown hair and low-top Converse sneakers, Musilli had moved to Detroit in 2011 to develop community partnerships for Whole Foods, attending city council meetings and doing ground-level outreach like teaching the budgeting classwhich shed started holding two years before opening day in a storefront office.


Earlier in the year, Musilli and I had discussed city residents initial response to the idea of the store. People said, well, how do you expect Detroiters to afford this? Musilli told me. Many times those were not Detroiters, and those were white people saying How are those people going to afford your food?  There is such a stark hostility between the citys affluent suburbs and Detroit, that it seemed possible that unnamed white suburbanites had sneered at Detroiters interest in Whole Foods. But it also was possible, I thought, that Musilli was telling this story to deflect attention from discussions of price.


I do want to start this talk about whats different here, because when comparing prices of things, its only fair to compare apples to apples, Musilli said at the August class, standing at the front of the room. Its not a fair comparison to compare our grass-fed, organic beef to factory-farmed beef. The class waited wordlessly for her to continue, and Musilli listed the ingredients Whole Foods prohibits in food it sells: high fructose corn syrup; artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives; irradiated foods; MSG. Whole Foods 365 brand didnt contain GMOs, either, she added, deftly introducing the stores private label. Now I dont know if you guys know that genetically modified organisms are a concern, she said. We can talk about that. By 2018  every product will be labeled and its going to be similar to a cigarette label, that this product may contain genetically modified organisms. There was more friendly silence.


This general argumenta soft-pedaled version of You get what you pay foris at the heart of Whole Foods marketing, especially its extensive new Values Matter campaign. But it can be a tough sell for anyone whose finances are tight. After the class, Ruff told me she was open to paying at least slightly higher prices for certain things. Leaner meats might be more expensive, but they were healthier, and she was trying to learn how to balance those things out. It makes you feel good when you feed your family healthy stuff instead of junk, Ruff had told me earlier in the summer.

As Musilli ran through her presentation, she transitioned from her apples to apples argument to concrete shopping tips. Little of the advice she offered would surprise anyone who already watches their budget. On a post-class tour, she counseled her students to buy whole pineapples for $2.99 each rather than pay $3.29 for a pint of pre-cut chunks; to ignore the attractive, full-price cheddar displayed next to apples that were on sale; to compare prices per ounce rather than per package in the grocery aisle. But she also frequently reminded her students that Whole Foods wasnt just about deals, but value. At the meat counter, where boneless chicken breasts were priced $4.99 a pound, she said its unfair to talk about price  if were not talking about quality. When a student exclaimed at the $2.99 price for a dozen 365-brand eggs, Musilli observed that the chickens had never been in cages.


After the class broke up, Ruff, Williams, and I wandered the store, casually comparing selection and prices to what the two women said they found at Aldis and Save-a-Lot, where they usually shopped. We paused to look at a display of 365-brand organic applesauce cup six-packs. Ruff narrowed her eyes at the $2.99 price tag.


For a dollar, you can get four of them at Aldis, she said, referring not to the same brand, but packaged applesauce cups. Here, at Whole Foods, they were 50 cents each; at Aldis, 25 cents. Ruff examined the nutrition label: 11 grams of sugar. Thats a lot, she said to Williams.


Thats what we learned in our other class, that you really got to pay attention to that, said Williams.


Its saying low-sodium, no sugar added, said Ruff doubtfully.


That means its natural from the apples.


Natural sugar is better. So  Ruff scanned the ingredient list. It just say apples. OK. Cool.


Thats really cool, said Williams.


See, I would buy my kids this, said Ruff. Even though its a little more expensive. Ruff ended up buying a bag of frozen edamame and some almond milk, foods Tariks doctor had suggested as a way to boost nutrients with modest calorie burdens. I just figured I would pick it up, but I didnt see anything else that was interesting, Ruff told me later. That was the thing. I didnt see anything else that I really would have gotten from there that I couldnt get for a little cheaper from another store.

Listening to Ruff and Williams, I got the impression that Musillis pitch about value had fallen flat. While Ruff wanted her family to eat a healthy diet, she wasnt buying the premise that lies at the heart of Whole Foods ideology and marketing: that organic, non-GMO, and corn-syrup-free foods are inherently healthier than the alternative. When it came to grocery shopping, both women subscribed to basic nutrition guidelines that havent changed much in generations: less fat, sugar, and salt, more fruits and vegetables.


To just go completely organic seems crazy to me, said Ruff. If it was a little cheaper, if it was the same price as the other stuff, maybe. But to me, its overpriced. Her usual rule of thumb for determining quality was more pragmatic than the criteria listed by Musilli: As long as its not spoiled, molded, or expired, Im good with it.

Whole Paycheck vs. the Whole Community



There seem to be few things that irk Whole Foods representatives more than the phrase Whole Paycheck, a phrase that I remember Robb casually mentioning to me as an annoyance more than once. His dislike of the phrase was the first thing that came to mind when, on the Detroit stores opening day, Robb invited me to sit down, looked at me unblinkingly and said that if Whole Foods felt my story wasnt going in the direction they wanted, he would stop cooperating.


Whether they knew the moniker or not, one of Detroiters worries about Whole Foods before it opened was price, which ranked as a top concern when the company solicited community input about the store. In my early conversations with Whole Foods for this article, I heard a lot about how prices were key to making the store accessible to residents; how the Detroit store was trying to counter its reputation for sticker-shock by limiting wine prices to $20, the same per-pound limit it set for meat; and how, in Robbs words, those changes meant the store could serve all of Detroit. Even as Musilli tried to persuade shoppers like Ruff that cage-free eggs were worth the higher price, Robb was making the slightly contradictory case to reporters like me that Whole Foods prices were competitive with other stores.



There are few things that irk Whole Foods representatives more than the phrase Whole Paycheck.



Yet what you think of Whole Foods prices depends largely on what you consider competitive. When the Detroit store opened, it featured prices that were, compared to their usual prices, great deals: local, nonorganic collards were 99 cents a bunch, compared to $2.49 a bunch for organic collards at a Whole Foods in the suburbs of Detroit. And the hot food and salad bars cost $6.99 a pound instead of the usual $8.99.


But it is hard to see how a cheaper salad bar would help someone stretch his or her food dollaror food stamps. And though the collards seemed an unusually cheap option for Whole Foods, where they were displayed atop rustic wooden crates, it wasnt clear how their price compared to other stores in Detroit. I wanted to know more about that: How did Whole Foods compare when it came to basic staples for a Detroiter on a budget, things like eggs, yogurt, peanut butter, and cereal?


When I asked Whole Foods for a list of its competitive prices last summer, the company declined to provide one, so I compiled a list of 40 common grocery items and documented their prices at both the Detroit Whole Foods and King Cole, a neighborhood grocer in Detroits North End neighborhood. I borrowed Whole Foods preferred framework of comparing like to likein other words, comparing organic items to each otherbut I also checked the stores price to price, comparing the cheapest options available as a way of approximating the experience of a budget-conscious shopper. Based on my findings, if you were like Ruff and prioritized price, switching from King Cole to Whole Foods for groceries would cost 29 percent more for the full list of 40 items. If, on the other hand, a shopper agreed with Musilli and was willing to pay for the value offered by organic, Whole Foods was the clear winner, mostly because organic was an expensive rarity at King Cole, which only stocked three organic items, all more expensive than at Whole Foods.


Across the board, Whole Foods was much more competitive on price for packaged items like cereal and pasta sauce than for produce, meat, and dairyfresh items that Whole Foods often sells only organic versions of. Packaged items at Whole Foods were about 11 percent more expensive than at King Cole; fresh were 53 percent more expensive. Those disparities have shifted slightly over the last year; when I updated prices this past September, fresh items were 58 percent more expensive at Whole Foods, packaged items 4 percent. (These findings contradict the general thrust of several recent articles touting Whole Foods affordability.) And while Whole Foods is experimenting with lowering its prices on produce in its flagship store in Austin, the degree of the price cuts remains unclear. At the prices I saw this fall, its hard to see how eating a healthy diet, with lots of produce, would be an affordable option if you were to shop primarily at Whole Foods. (To get a sense of what different items cost at four Detroit-area grocery storesKing Cole, a suburban Walmart, the Detroit Whole Foods, and a suburban Whole Foodsplay around with the following interactive shopping cart of basic grocery staples based on prices I collected in September, or download the entire data set with prices, brand names, and category comparisons.)

You can see all the prices Tracie McMillan collected in Detroit from Sept. 1822 here. To learn more about McMillan's data collection methods and data analysis, visit the Food & Environment Reporting Network's website.



When I discussed Whole Foods pricing with Robb in January, he repeated something Id heard him say many times: that Whole Foods was competitive on price. I agreed with Robb that Whole Foods was the cheapest place in Detroit for organics, but pointed out that it could be more expensive to do all your grocery shopping there than at neighborhood grocers. Robb said he took issue with the idea that Whole Foods was more expensive than other stores. I dont agree with your premise there, he said, bristling. Whole Foods, on like-to-like items, and on basic staples, is very competitive, in any market.


A few days later, I sent Whole Foods the price comparisons Id gathered, asking if Robb could address the question Id been trying to ask: What about doing all your grocery shopping at Whole Foods, not just buying select items, given these numbers? How competitive did Whole Foods see itself in that context? Within a couple days, Whole Foods sent me their own version of the list, on which the tallies had shifted: The prices for Whole Foods had dropped, and those for King Cole had risen, shrinking the markup for Whole Foods from 29 to 8 percent. When I explained that I could not use Whole Foods data on its competitors prices, Whole Foods declined to answer further questions for the story. When I pressed the issue in October, a spokesperson, Kate Lowery, told me my study was not accurate, but declined to explain further.


I was surprised by Whole Foods refusal to engage in a direct conversation about price. In my earlier conversations with Robb, he had agreed that past criticism of the store for high prices had been deserved, and he spoke eloquently about wanting to increase demand for healthier food, which he saw Whole Foods as well positioned to meet. But whenever I observed that it costs more to shop for all ones groceries there, he repeated the mantra that Whole Foods was competitive on like-to-like items, and changed the subject to quality.


The cheapest food is not always the best deal for you, from the health perspective. Yes, you can buy cheaper food than what we offer at Whole Foods, but theres often a trade off, said Robb, echoing Musilli. I dont know how to tell you the difference between pink slime and beef thats been raised to our standards. Its not the same product, but is it worth it to you?


Whole Foods had a plan to make that case across the city. Not through newspaper circulars or television ads, not even through city officials. Instead, the grocer had brought to Detroit its own healthy eating ambassador.

The Ambassador



The first time I saw Dr. Akua Woolbright lecture, she was in front of a crowd of about 60 people, most of them black, sitting in Sacred Heart Church on a hot, rainy summer night. Early on, Woolbright warned her audience that, as a nutritionist, she would not be advocating incremental dietary change because, you would never say, Well,its okay, you can kind of kill peoplebut do it in moderation.  The crowd laughed, warming to Woolbright, who began the talk by introducing herself as the granddaughter of a rural Texas preacher and farmer.

Woolbrights ability to speak authentically in the vernaculars of the black church, holistic healers (of whom there were several at the church), and sustainable foodiesand to translate between themmake her a natural emissary for Whole Foods in Detroit. As the stores nutritionist, she started offering classes there in 2012, a year before the store opened. She began visiting weekly from Austin, and was so taken with the city that she moved to Detroit that fall with her son. She taught classes in high schools and community centers, urging people to eat diets based on whole ingredients, dense nutrients, healthy fats, and plant-based food. Her job, Woolbright told me, was not to promote Whole Foods but to encourage healthy diets, though I noticed she sometimes failed to separate the two. Her church lecture closely tracked Health Starts Here, an in-store health promotion program, and, while Woolbright focused on food advice, she peppered the talk with casual references to the company. Still, Woolbright was persuasive when she spoke about her work: Its personal to me. I want to do this work anyway, she told me. [Whole Foods] mission and my mission are the same thing.


In the weeks after the store opened, Woolbright began to offer in-store hours, and so on a bright Saturday morning last summer, I spent a few hours chatting with her at a high wooden table in the bulk foods section. We had been there for about an hour when a heavyset black woman named Spencer Torry Brown, wearing sweats and an Air Jordan T-shirt, paused in front of the table. Browns cart held a few wrapped packages from the meat counter and a metal cane.


She told me you could help me, said Brown, gesturing to a woman at the meat counter. Woolbright nodded and Brown began, without prompting, to list her health problems: epileptic seizures, diabetes, COPD. She didnt drive. She had recently found herself eating cookies and chain smoking until the wee hours of the morning. Im not eating the right foods, Im eating those Oreos, she told me later, shaking her head. I am. Im going through them mothers like  Her voice trailed off, incredulous and embarrassed. And I say to myself, somethings wrong  I have to stop. So thats why Im here.


Woolbright listened to Brown thoughtfully, then disappeared into the aisles, returning with an armful of food and a game plan. She held up a can of McCanns steel-cut oats. In the morning you have to put something bulky, heavy in your stomach. If you dont weigh it down you will continue to crave high calorie foods. She suggested making a big pot of oats on Sundays, and eating from that during the week, sweetening it with bananas or maple syrup. More advice followed: Canned beans, no sodium added, are a quick way to fill up. Whole wheat pasta cooks quickly and has whole grains. Oats were good for a green smoothie; she recommended buying a NutriBullet blender at Walmart. Brown nodded appreciatively and promised to email Woolbright if she had more questions, but she left the beans and oatmeal behind.


The changes Woolbright suggested werent complicated, but I had a hard time seeing even myself making them. The idea of reheating porridge for the week was distinctly unappealing. Buying a $100 blender for breakfast smoothies seemed unrealistic, particularly for someone living, as Brown did, on disability checks.


On that first visit to Whole Foods, Brown didnt buy the stores organic cookies or other junk food, but she didnt heed much of Woolbrights advice, either. As I accompanied her through the store, Brown seemed excited by the options before her. She bought Balinese barbecue tofu salad from the deli, a rotisserie chicken, turkey patties with spinach, chicken shish kebabs, a peach smoothie, andin a nod to Woolbrights advicesome produce, including five non-organic bananas. It all looked fresh, delicious, and wholesome, but the total came to $66.05, about one-third of Browns monthly grocery budget. With discipline, I guessed, it could cover lunch and dinner for about a week.

The food she bought, I told her later, seemed expensive, but Brown shrugged it off. You know, I dont worry about expensive sometimes, she told me later. I mean, it cant be over $20, but if its like $2  she paused. Im not a scaredy person as far as buying something. As Brown talked, it was hard not to hear an echo of Musilli: She wanted to eat healthy foods, and she felt willing to pay more for it when she could. I got the sense that, for Brown, feeling she was both making a healthy decision and treating herself had proved irresistible.

It was difficult to get Brown to talk for long about either supermarkets or changing her habits. Instead, discussions that started off with a grocery store quickly veered off course, derailed by the problems that preceded any thoughts Brown had about health. Without a car, unable to walk far, and living in a city with unreliable public transit, Brown mostly took cabs or depended on friends and family with cars. Her medications included prednisone, a steroid that made her ravenous. (She blamed it for her Oreo binges.) When Brown moved this spring, her new apartment in Hamtramck had no stove, further limiting her meal options.


Brown shared this list of obstacles nearly every time I asked her whether she had followed Woolbrights advice. Sometimes she would talk about how much she had liked Woolbright, but after a phone consultation last summer, when Brown took down some notes about shopping, she said they hadnt been in touch. When Brown moved, she lost the scrap of paper on which shed written down Woolbrights advice.



Most days it felt easier, more predictable, less likely to result in failure, to just keep doing what she was doing.



Brown was obese and unhappy about it. I dont want to be this way; I dont, she told me. But it was difficult to see grocery stores as a primary factor in her weight problem. On one visit last summer, her breakfast had been white bread, turkey, Miracle Whip, and mustard, an attempt at following Woolbrights suggestion to eat lean meats. Though that sandwich was not a kale salad, it was also not a Big Mac and fries. When I returned this fall, I asked Brown how she was doing with following Woolbrights advice, and she showed me to a lidless Tupperware in her refrigerator with corn kernels and green beans. Im a veggie person, really. I like broccoli and beans and corn, she said. What little other food she had looked nominally healthy: chicken thighs, eggs, cheese slices, a jug of water, and a jug of Minute Maid punch (three for $5 at her neighborhood supermarket), condiments in the door. The problem, she said, was her sweet tooth. Last summer, it had been the Oreos; this year, money was tighter, so it was pancakes and syrup.


What seemed to be tripping Brown up wasnt knowledge about nutrition so much as a debilitating sense that anything she tried to changewhat she ate, how she spent her dayscould spiral out of control, whether because of depression or finances or transport or health. Going to the store meant worrying about getting someone to drive her, she told me, and once there she had to worry about the driver getting upset with her for taking too long. Then she had to worry about trying to cookshe had only a microwave and a George Foreman grilland even so she couldnt stand long enough to cook much, anyway. At nearly 300 pounds, getting to a healthy weight felt insurmountable. Most days it felt easier, more predictable, less likely to result in failure, to just keep doing what she was doing.


It can be tempting to disparage Brown for her tendency to get overwhelmed by the myriad issueshealth, transport, moneythat she faced, but recent research suggests that its a problem common across all levels of education and social class. When you are struggling with lots on your mind, that just leaves less mind for other things in everyday life, said Eldar Shafir, a behavioral researcher at Princeton University. Shafir calls this tendency bandwidth poverty, which he and Harvard economist Sendhil Mullainathan documented in multiple experiments for their book, Scarcity. Whenever most people face multiple problems at once, they focus on the most urgent oneand may do fairly well with it. But when it comes to everything else, said Shafir, theres just not enough brainpower to go around. Youre going to get both depleted and distracted, and forgetful, and not do things exactly right, said Shafir. It is easy to see an example of that in the way that Brown had shopped so healthfully after speaking with Woolbrightyet budgeted so poorly.


Brown told me she visited Whole Foods twice last year. She liked that it was clean and pretty and bright, that she could sit down, have a nice snack, maybe meet people. She liked its wholesome, healthy aura. None of that was true of Walmart or her local supermarket or the corner store where she bought cookies. Whole Foods is great, said Brown. It make you feel  it put you in a right perspective of yourself being healthy. What she liked about Whole Foods, it turned out, were the same things that middle-class people liked.

When Woolbright and I discussed Browns shopping trip, I commented that Brown had bought food that looked healthy, but was fairly expensive. Right, right, said Woolbright. Thats a different question, she said, shifting our discussion from cost to quality. Were not talking about expense right now, were talking about nutrition choices, she said. Her role as a nutritionist, as she saw it, was to give Brown information about the healthiest choices she could make; it wasnt any of her business to tell Brown how to prioritize her budget.


People make assumptions about, Oh, theyre on welfare. I cant believe they bought bottled water  or other expensive things, said Woolbright. I dont make those assumptions for people. I heard an echo of Musillis story about white suburbanites assumptions about Detroit. There was merit to what Woolbright said, but Whole Foods seemed to have settled on a media strategy of deflecting questions about price by suggesting that it is paternalistic, if not classist and racist, to ask whether its food is affordable to the poor.


If you do ask that question, though, you find that the healthiest foods at Whole Foodsthe produce, the meat, the dairyare all sold at prices that exclude the poor, Brown included, from regularly shopping there. Whatever value Whole Foods may offer, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that a company selling healthier food at a 29 percent markup widens the class divide in diet and health rather than narrowing it.


Still, Woolbright was right about desire. I feel like people want to do better; they want to do better, she said. This was clearly true of Brown: She wanted to eat, and feel, betterand she saw Whole Foods as a way to do both when, and if, she could afford it.

The $6 Cupcake



This September, Toyoda Ruff settled into an upholstered chair while her husband finished his dinner: a mound of lettuce, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Ruff was planning to eat later, probably some vegetable-beef soup she had made over the weekend. Ive been to the Whole Foods stores a couple of timesthe almond milk, the stuff that was on sale, said Ruff, holding a toddler nephew on her lap. But I didnt really pick up the meat or a lot of the vegetables, they were kind of expensive, she said; she still favored Aldis. Of Whole Foods, said Ruff, Thats the bourgie store, she said. I just wonder how many people come from the hood and go shopping at Whole Foods store. I bet you its not a lot.

I was curious about that, too. Knowing how many of Whole Foods customers were actually poor would give an indication of the progress Whole Foods had made toward its goal of serving all Detroiters. In January, I asked Whole Foods how their Detroit stores sales from SNAPfood stampscompared to the companys other stores; nearby independent grocers had told me 75, even 80, percent of their sales came from SNAP. Though Whole Foods declined to share specific numbers, Robb did say that SNAP sales in Detroit were an impressive five or six times the chains average, suggesting they had reached more of the poor than at their other stores. A source who was familiar with the Detroit store and its initial sales performance, and who declined to be named for professional reasons, told me that Whole Food averages about 1 or 2 percent of sales from SNAP nationwide. If both Robb and my source are correct, 5 to 12 percent of Whole Foods Detroit sales are from SNAP. Since 38 percent of Detroit residents make use of the SNAP program, this estimate suggests the store isnt reaching a cross section of the city, but a targeted, upper-income niche.



The lesson from Whole Foods in Detroit may well be that the problem is not food, but poverty.



Indeed, last summer, when all the numbers had been crunched after the opening crush of business, the store found itself considering selling more expensive items, not cheaper ones. The top seller in the bakery department had been a single cupcake, baked in a half-pint jar. It sold for $6. Customers had been asking for more lamb, better cuts of meat, and higher quality wine. The busiest time at the store, Banks told me, was lunch hour, when office workers flooded the storeit is one of the few places for quick take-out within walking distance of the medical complex next door. Last November the store added a breakfast bar with $5 breakfast burritos. By autumn, bottles of wine topped out at $42, and meats at $30 per pound, instead of $20. This slide toward higher prices suggests that Whole Foods was having more success with its traditional customers than with lower-income ones.


None of this repudiates the idea that Whole Foods is a broadly positive thing for Detroit. In addition to a grocery store, the city got the gentrification signifier that it sought. Development in Midtownand elsewhere in the cityhas continued to expand, and local officials have told me Whole Foods success has made it easier to persuade companies to give Detroit a try. At last count, the store had created 180 jobs with wages well above the federal and state minimums. Robb has spent his own money in town, paying for new signs at the farmers market, persuading his suppliers to donate $150,000 in equipment to a commercial kitchen for food entrepreneurs, and hosted a benefit to raise money for the project. Even Ruff and Brown, who have little use for the store, told me they are glad its there.


In strictly financial terms, Whole Foods has succeeded in Detroit. Sales there have been double the initial projections, and despite Whole Foods reputation as a store for wealthy whites, my visits to the store suggest that its customer base reflects the fact that Detroit is majority black. When Robb was in Detroit this past September for a conference to drum up corporate interest in the city, he said the chain is looking to open a second store there.

But if you consider Robbs broader initial goalsto reach families just trying to eat healthier, to make truly healthy food truly accessible to a broad swath of the city, to tackle the class divide in healthWhole Foods hasnt gotten very far. Robbs eloquent talk aside, Whole Foods isnt too preoccupied with finding a market among shoppers like Ruff and Williams, for whom the pitch that cage-free and genetically modified are healthier than other food doesnt merit the markup. Shoppers wanting simple, affordable healthy food, rather than an aspirational product, have better options elsewhere. And for indisputably poor people like Brown, who aspire to buy what Whole Foods sells, the prices simply arent low enough to work. This is not to call into question the sincerity of Robbs desire to improve health outcomes in Detroit, but rather the impracticalityif not disingenuousnessof tying such a broad social goal to a marketing plan that requires, by definition, spending 29 percent more on your groceries. For anyone looking to address health and diet disparities, the lesson from Whole Foods in Detroit may well be that the problem is not food, but poverty. And that is a problem that requires more than a supermarket to solve.

Truthfully, that is something that Robb knows. When I last talked to Robb, in January, I believed him when he told me he was troubled by the the idea that health is, somehow, the province of the richwhich its not, and how the disparity [in access to healthy food] is unacceptable from a moral perspective. Those things, I told him, troubled me, too.


I asked Robb what that meant for Whole Foods, where grocery shopping was more expensive. Ultimately customers get to choose. Its a free market, and were going to present our choices, and then people are going to decide if theyre worth it or not, said Robb. Ruff, Brown, the rest of Detroit, even the rest of Americaall were welcome to peruse the aisles and decide whether the grass-fed beef was worth the markup over pink slime. You know, were not miracle workers, Robb told me. Were just a grocer.

Slate,L,"Cleveland police, Justice Department: Systemic use of excessive force. ","Attorney general Eric Holder announced today that a federal investigation of nearly 600 incidents involving Cleveland officers indicates that the city's police department systematically uses excessive force. The investigation was opened in March 2013, well predating the recent killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by Cleveland officer Tim Loehmann. From Cleveland.com:

The investigation by six Justice Department lawyers, plus several independent policing experts, found that systemic deficiencies and practices haunt the city's police department. The problems include insufficient accountability, inadequate training, ineffective policies, and inadequate engagement with the community, according to a 58-page letter given to Jackson...
The investigation was prompted by the 2012 deaths of two unarmed suspects who were killed in ""a hail of 137 bullets"" after a chase. A number of officers were punished for their actions during the incident:

Officer Michael Brelo, who fired 49 rounds, is awaiting trial on voluntary manslaughter charges for the fatal shootings of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams. Five supervisors were charged with dereliction of duty for their roles in the chase that involved 62 police cruisers and 100 officers. More than 70 officers and supervisors were disciplined for their roles in the chase.
Justice officials will now hold meetings with police, public figures, and residents in order to put together a ""consent decree"" set of reform guidelines that will be overseen by a court-appointed monitor. Holder's department has enacted nine other such decrees during his tenure, which has been marked by aggressive action on racially tinged civil rights and policing issues.

Slate,L,Broken windows policing doesnt work. It also may have killed Eric Garner.,"On July 17, 2014, an unarmed 43-year-old black man named Eric Garner was standing near the Staten Island Ferry dock when he was approached by several police officers. The cops suspected that Garner was selling untaxed cigarettes. A struggle ensued, and an officer named Daniel Pantaleo put Garner in a chokehold. Garner died, and the New York City medical examiner eventually ruled it a homicide. But on Wednesday afternoon, a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo.

Why was Garner approached at all? Because of the emphasis on broken windows policing under NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton. As Mayor Rudolph Giulianis police commissioner in the 1990s, Bratton presided over a surge in petty-crime law enforcement, on the theory that vigorously enforcing the small laws in some way dissuades or prevents people from breaking the big ones. Theres little evidence that theory is correct. Nevertheless, mayor-elect Bill de Blasio brought Bratton back as New Yorks police commissioner last December. Brattons return meant the return of broken windows policing. If you take care of the little things, then you can prevent a lot of the big things, Bratton said in March, spouting the broken windows gospel. Its that philosophy as much as anything else is to blame for Eric Garners death.


Bratton was a popular figure during the Giuliani era because crime rates fell on his watch. While observers were quick to credit his policies for that decline, theres no reason to think the drop in violent crime had anything to do with broken windows or Brattons vaunted Compstat, a computer program that tracks crime statistics citywide.


    Advertisement




The drop in New Yorks violent crime rate, then and now, is consistent with a broader nationwide trend. Rates of violent crime have steadily declined nationwide over the past two decades, and nobody is really sure why. The best argument Ive seen suggests that violent crime began to fall around the same time that the crack boom started to wane in the early 1990s. The rates have been dropping across the country since then.


We do know that the declines in violent crime in New York have been comparable to declines in cities that didnt use Compstat or broken windows. As criminologist Richard Rosenfeld put it in a 2002 paper, homicide rates also have decreased sharply in cities that did not noticeably alter their policing policies, such as Los Angeles, or that instituted very different changes from those in New York, such as San Diego. The takeaway: Crime just keeps going down everywhere. Nobody is sure why.


In New York, broken windows has replaced stop-and-frisk as the controversial police tactic du jour. During his 2012 campaign, de Blasio pledged to rein in the ineffective and racist stop-and-frisk policies of Michael Bloomberg, and he has followed through on that promise. Meanwhile, de Blasios Republican mayoral opponent, Joseph Lhota, made the supposed glories of stop-and-frisk the centerpiece of his own doomed campaign. Lhota blasted de Blasios recklessly dangerous agenda on crime, and predicted that abandoning stop-and-frisk would turn New York City into something like the hellscape depicted in The Warriors, with gangs and street punks running roughshod over police officers.


This hasnt happened. In a recent press conference, de Blasio and Bratton announced that violent crime rates are poised for historic lows in 2014. The New York Times reports that robberies and grand larcenies have both declined since 2013. The citys homicide count sits at 290 as of Dec. 1, which puts New York on pace to beat last years record low homicide count of 335. And all this in a year when the New York Police Department is poised to log fewer than 50,000 stop-and-frisk incidentsa figure nearly 10 times lower than it was at New Yorks stopping-and-frisking peak. Take that, Joe Lhota!


But this shouldnt be surprising. Under the Bloomberg administration, hundreds of thousands of people were detained by police each year via the departments stop-and-frisk program. Close to 90 percent of those people were released without charges after the stopping officers found nothing illegal. Whatever effect stop-and-frisk may have had as a deterrent was likely offset by the fact that it taught innocent people to fear and avoid the police. Stopping people who are doing nothing wrong on the grounds that they look vaguely suspicious only serves to alienate cops from the communities theyre supposed to serve.


With the decline of stop-and-frisk and the return of broken windows, the NYPD has traded one dubious tactic for another. When Bratton was appointed in December 2013, de Blasio positioned him as the opposite of his predecessor as police commissioner, Ray Kelly, saying in a press conference that public safety and respect for the public arent contradictory ideas. Bratton, for his part, promised policies of mutual respect and mutual trust, and vowed that I will get it right in this city once moreimplying, of course, that he had gotten it right the first time. Three months later, the New York Times reported that arrests of subway panhandlers had tripled since Bratton took over, and that there had been a noticeable spike in arrests for low-level violations in public housing developments.


This renewed emphasis on misdemeanor quality of life arrests has sparked renewed criticisms from community members who are tired of being hassled. These criticisms spiked after Garners death in July. Six members of New Yorks congressional delegation sent Attorney General Eric Holder a letter noting that Mr. Garners death has taken place in the context of a broken windows policing strategy that appears to target communities of color for the enforcement of minor violations and low-level offenses.


Two weeks after Garners death, de Blasio held a press conference to address these criticisms and defend broken windows. Breaking a law is breaking a law, and it has to be addressed, said de Blasio.


Thats nonsense. The cornerstone of effective policing is discretion. If the cops enforced every single law on the books in every single precinct at all hours of the day, New York City would become a police state. Is that what de Blasio and Bratton want?


For mayors and police commissioners, being tough on crime means actively implementing some specific policy. But given that violent crime seems to be declining on its own regardless of what they do, theres a case to be made that de Blasio and Bratton are only making things worse. Heres a suggestion for a new policing policy for New York City: First, do no harm.

The movie reunites Baumbach with his Greenberg star Ben Stiller, this time pairing him with Naomi Watts, who plays Stillers wife, and juxtaposing that couple with a younger duo, played by Adam Driver of Girls fame and Amanda Seyfried of Mean Girls fame.

The trailer, with admirable ambition, introduces us to the movie with quotes from Ibsens The Master Builderand then cleverly echoes one of those quotes in its choice of song, Let Em In by Sir Paul McCartney, which was a big hit for Wings. The music at the beginning, by the way, is Vivaldis Mandolin Concerto in C Major, from Le Nozze di Figaro, which has a very Wes Anderson feel.

Slate,L,"Top skyscrapers around the world that were stalled, stunted, stopped midconstruction, or never built. ","Without big dreams, there would be no tall buildings, researchers from the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat write in a new report. Conceiving, financing, designing, and constructing a skyscraper is no simple feat, even under the best of conditions.

Alas, every grand architectural dream does not come to fruition, and not all skyscrapers end up reaching their ultimate heights. The researchers say that some projects suffer from torturously slow gestation periods; many more have failed to start or were interrupted and cancelled. Naturally, we began to wonder how many tall buildings were started and not finished, and which held the records for longest construction time.

The illustrations pictured above represent the worlds 20 tallest buildings that started works on site but were never completed as planned, as of last month. The reasons that these designs were never fully realized are variedsome fell victim to financial obstacles, others, political pressures and cultural shifts.

In the study, the authors note, a building is considered to be never completed when site works had begun, but were completely halted, and no reports indicate that construction will continue. The site may go on to accommodate a new building, different to the original design, that may or may not retain the original construction.


The Metropolitan Life North Annex in New York, for example, was meant to be 100 stories tall. Construction was halted in 1933 at the 31st floor and remained there when the building was completed in 1950. In 2006, construction began on the Waterview Tower in Chicagoa structure that was meant to be 1,047 feet (319 meters) and 89 stories tallonly to be halted at the 26th floor two years later. The building was ultimately redesigned, ending up at 617 feet (188 meters) tall and rebaptized OneEleven.

The Centro Financiero Confinanzas (aka Torre David) in Caracas, Venezuela, began construction in 1990 but was abandoned midproject for financial reasons. It sheltered several hundred Venezuelan families until they were relocated last July. The Pentominium in Dubai, begun in 2008, would have been the second-tallest building in the world had it been successfully completed for its target date of 2014, but only reached 30 stories when it was put on hold in 2011.


There are 50 building projects around the world 492 feet (150 meters) or taller that are currently on hold, meaning that construction began and stopped but is planned to resume.

Slate,L,Dave Brandon: The resignation of Michigans villainous athletic director is why we like college sports.,"On Sept. 27, the Michigan football team was losing badly at home to Minnesota, a team the Wolverines typically destroy. The loss would drop Michigan to 23 on the season, a new low point for a program thats found a number of creative ways to embarrass itself over the last few years. The student section, looking for a scapegoat, broke into chants. The first was Fire Brady, referring to the teams beleaguered head coach, Brady Hoke. Their next demand was much more unusual: Fire Brandon, the students shouted, calling for the head of Michigans unusually high-profile, and unusually unpopular, athletic director Dave Brandon.

Today, the students more or less got what they were asking for: Brandon resigned, his departure covered on ESPNs bottom-line ticker and in the New York Times. How did a college athletics administrator end up making national news? As the chant indicates, he did it by going to war with his teams fansand, hearteningly, losing.


Brandon, a former Dominos Pizza CEO, was never beloved by Michigan fans. He jacked up ticket prices and created a hyped-up, corporate culturenovelty, made-for-TV matchups and novelty, made-for-TV uniformsaround a program whose supporters take pride (maybe too much pride) in their respect for tradition.


    Advertisement




In the past two months, the athletic director transformed from a figure of local disrepute to something of a national villain. In the Minnesota gamethe same one during which students chanted for Brandons ousterthe Michigan coaching staff badly mishandled a player who had clearly been concussed, sending quarterback Shane Morris back into the game despite his obvious head injury. As fans and the national media rained invective down on the Michigan program, Brandon told a reporter that he had more important jobs to do than speaking to the press about the Morris imbroglio. And this week, the fan site MGoBlog published a number of snotty emails Brandon sent in response to complaints from alumni and season-ticket holders. I really dont care about your opinions, read one. Another: I suggest you find a new team to support. We will be fine without you.


Meanwhile, Hoke, the head coach whom Brandon hired and has defended aggressively, has led the team to a 35 record and appears to be on his way out as well. Disenchanted students have taken their anger outside the stadium, marching on the university presidents house calling for Brandons dismissal. (That a Michigan football coach could lose to Michigan State by 24 points and not be the biggest problem on fans mind says a lot about Brandons popularity.)


Amid the deluge of bad press, Brandon remained, as they say, defiant, reportedly attributing the movement against him to electoral politics. (The University of Michigan is supervised by regents who declare party affiliations and are chosen via statewide vote.) It was the kind of spin hed gotten away with many times beforeas others have observed, Brandons usual response to backlash against his decisions is to blame someone else for them in a mealy-mouthed press release. He also had the public support of Stephen Ross, a real-estate billionaire and perhaps the most important man in Michigans vast network of alumni donors.


As the weeks went on and Brandon remained in his job, Michigan fans like me started to get a sinking feeling. How many times have we seen fans rebel against their teams incompetent management to no effect whatsoever? The Knicks James Dolan, the Florida Marlins Jeffrey Loria, the Washington NFL franchises Dan SnyderI could go on. Sports fans dont have a lot of powersure, they can stop going to games, but stubborn owners can ride out declines in revenue, especially given how much of their money comes from national TV deals shared with other teams. (Not to mention how many of them inherited their teams as part of larger family fortunes that can help cover losses.) A perennial state of justified but futile outrage is the norm for many of us.


But, as you may already have observed, college teams dont have owners. Even someone as rich as Stephen Ross doesnt get to have the final say on Dave Brandons job (although, perhaps realizing which way the wind was blowing, Ross said this week that he would not object if Brandon were replaced). That authority belongs to the schools president, who must make decisions not on the principle of I own the team so I can do whatever I want, but by weighing the input of interested ticketholders, students, alumni, former players, and donors. Or, described collectively, fans.

Michigans president, Mark Schlissel, has been on something of a listening tour in the past few weeks, appearing at various public and private meetings within the university community and making carefully worded statements empathizing with fan frustration. Schlissel acknowledged the crisis, took public control of it, and nudged along the consensus that it was time for Brandons departure. It got to the point this week that the embattled A.D. had no choice but to come to that realization himself. It was a story of leaders channeling and managing popular opinion that could have come out of a civics textbook, right down to the compromise at the end. (Brandon gets to say he left on his own terms, and will receive the full $3 million he had left on his contract).


That college sports have a democratic element isnt an unqualified advantagefor an example of what can go wrong in a consensus-based system, see 90 percent of American political news on any given day. But the fact that the community around college teams is an actual grassroots community does account for much of those teams appeal. (Its worth noting that one of the most beloved and successful NFL franchisesthe Green Bay Packersis literally community-owned.) Over the last few months in Ann Arbor, the fans spoke and a team listened. Whens the last time you could say that?

Rather than photograph the performances, Morarescu focuses his lens on the artists right after they finish their shows, while they still have the energy of creativity.


That feeling is what I want to capture in the portraits. It feels like you can still catch some traces of what happened in the performance some minutes before, he said via email.

Performance art is a largely interdisciplinary genre, one thats inclusive of many different techniques and approaches. Morarescus photos reflect the extreme diversity of places, costumes, and concepts that fall under its umbrella.


Morarescu has photographed more than 180 performers at art venues and festivals in dozens of countries. Usually organized by the artists, the festivals, he said, are intense social exchanges full of eating, drinking, and collaborating. Sometimes it feels like a summer camp or a family reunionin a positive way.

He hopes his photos give a sense of each performers personality, but Morarescu also hopes they inspire more questions than they answer. I want to awaken curiosity, open minds, and let viewers imagine what was happening before the photos.


And while he aims to evoke something of the performance in his photos, he wants viewers to see them as making unique artistic statements of their own. Performance art is a marginal form, one that normally happens in front of small audiences in alternative venues far from the mainstream. What makes it special is its temporal condition, the fact that this art form is destructed at the same moment that is created, he said. The results are ephemeral and any effort to document or register them become new products that are something different.

  Jestina Koko, 25, has been crippled since the age of 3 and depends on her arms to lift and drag herself. She survives by doing laundry for others, selling cookies on the street, and begging in Monrovia, Liberia. Both she and her daughter, Satta Quaye, 5, suffer from malaria. Rene C. Byer


 


  Labone, 27, takes a moment to hold her young daughter Nupur, 1, who was fathered by a client, before she has to return to her evenings work in a brothel in Jessore, Bangladesh. Rene C. Byer


 

In order to give her subjects context about what she was doing, Byer would show them her previous work. By doing that, she hoped to prove that she wasnt simply a photographer looking to make a picture and run away.


This was about understanding people and listening to their plight, she said. I wanted them to feel comfortable with what we were doing. Every person has a life and every person can be heard in this book: Whats the name of that child, how old is that child, what is the story behind that child, Im trying to get that connection so people can imagine their child in this childs shoes.


Some pictures are agonizingly painful to look at, but I was conscious to make them in a way that people could imagine themselves in the scene. That was the challenge to ask people to step into the photograph, could they live in these circumstances? My question is could you live in these circumstances, and if you couldnt, why wouldnt you want to help?



  In the slums of northern India, Kalpana, 20, starves one of her children Sangeeta, 2, while her sister Sarita, 5 months, sleeps. Sometimes a child is starved to appear sympathetic in the hope of generating more income while begging. This money is often used to feed other children, thus, in practice, one child is sacrificed for the sake of others. Rene C. Byer


 


  A sea of people passes by Hunupa Begum, 13, who has been blind for the past 10 years and lives close to the Nizamudin Bangala Masjid Mosque in New Delhi, India. She begs as the only source of income for her family. Her wheelchair was donated by a passerby. Rene C. Byer


 

After spending two years making the photographs, Byer spent another two years editing the images and strategizing how to get the message out since she feels a huge responsibility to my subjects. Its not just enough to make a photographyou have to get that photograph into a place where it can help.


One of the hardest parts of editing was the understanding that a lot of peoples stories wouldnt be heard. Byer hopes to get a website up that includes all of the outtakes from the book to continue the conversation.


Painful, she said about not being able to include everyone in the book. Extremely painful. There are still photographs that tug at my heart I would love to put in the book  theres only so much you can publish, there are several instances where I would lose sleep over those that didnt make it into the book.

Slate,L,Edie Bresler: We Sold a Winner looks at the stores that sold winning lottery tickets around the country (PHOTOS).,"Shortly after the economic crisis in 2008,Edie Breslerbegan noticing lottery tickets littering her neighborhood just outside Boston. She followed them back to the source and found that most of them had been sold at local mom-and-pop shops.

It was like discovering an underground cult, Bresler said. The more time I spent in small stores talking to the people who were buying the tickets, the more I started realizing I knew nothing about it.


She decided to photograph the culture behind the lottery and realized her initial discovery of small businesses was one of the more intriguing components. For her series, We Sold a Winner, she focuses on the shop owners who sold the winning tickets.

Close to $70 billion is spent in the United States on the lottery annually, or,as John Oliver put it recently, more than the total spent on music, movies, and porn combined. Aside from the winners, Breser noted, the owners of these mom-and-pop shops are some of the few people who actually benefit from winning tickets, although the commission they receive for selling a winning ticket varies drastically from state to state.


Every state is different, some have a really small commission and others it is incredibly generous. In Michigan its $5,000 and in Illinois right next door its $500,000 so its crazy.



  Third and Fourth Generation Braddock Residents, Al and Albert. Father and son work together at this Pennsylvania shop that opens daily at 4 a.m. to serve workers in nearby steel mills.

Her corporate bosses received the maximum Illinois bonus commission of $500,000. As manager, Denise received $25,000 and used the money to purchase a bassoon for her husband. Edie Bresler


 


  The Patel Family.Harry Patel is the owner of Jays in Lowell, Massachusetts. Considered a very lucky store by neighborhood players, they have sold two winning $1 million scratch tickets in the last 10 years. Edie Bresler


 

So far, out of the 44 states that have a lottery, Bresler has been to around 20. She gets notifications and, depending on her schedule, travels to the stores that award prizes of at least $1 million. She then hangs around for up to a week meeting the owners and the people who play the lottery, interviewing them and taking their pictures.


She uses primarily a digital camera but also brings along her 4X5. She said working with the more cumbersome camera is often a greaticebreaker since people become curious about the equipment.


Its incredibly valuable because Im out there all day and I let them look and see how it works so by the time the light is right, theyre all rooting for me and theyre also all ignoring me, she said. I think it is a way for them to feel I am really serious about what Im doing, Im there to engage with them and talk with them and they enjoy it  they appreciate that it is an art form.


I discovered another robust economy, she said about the ticket sellers. One owner put it to me this way: A store without the lottery is like a bar without alcohol.

Slate,L,Nonce words: Why does English have so many obscure words?,"This questionoriginally appeared on Quora, the best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.

Answer by Joshua Engel:


    Advertisement




English speakers have a surreal fascination with obscure words.


I don't know if this is unique to English speakers. Maybe everybody does it. But there are a lot of words that are in the English language, primarily in the sense of being in dictionaries of the English language. Those dictionaries are full of Nonce words, created for a one-off purpose and never used again. But dictionary-makers love those words, and as long as they have a citation, they'll put it in the dictionary.


The word nonce was coined by the creator of the Oxford English Dictionary, which is crammed full of nonce words. There are whole dictionaries filled with nothing but nonce words, such as Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure, and Preposterous Words. Rich Hall coined the word sniglet for making up a word just because you want it to exist and published several books of it. Douglas Adams published a similar book,The Meaning of Liff.


I don't know why such things exist, but English speakers appear to love this game. They love to make up words, and the dictionary-makers are obsessed with collecting them. They'll similarly suck up any word ever used in any dialect of English. The makers of the Scrabble dictionary are the worst, randomly accumulating words from foreign languages when they're likely to prove useful in the game but are never otherwise used.


In my opinion, it's a bit misleading to even call such things English words. The actual English language, in use, is not significantly larger than other major languages. An abridged dictionary is going to cover the vast majority of words that see real use, and using words from outside that set often seems affected rather than precise. It has left English with a lovely collection of subtle differences between words with nearly the same surface meaning, and I think that has had a beneficial effect on English prose, but it's practically designed to exclude foreigners.

            Matt Groening's ""cromulent"" (meaning basically, ""for real, not justmade-up"") is my favorite nonce word. Because think about it - is ""cromulent"" a cromulent word, or not? Boom - your head just exploded. More...

Which may actually be the answer. There's a one-upmanship (in any language) to marking in-groups and out-groups with vocabulary. Knowledge of obscure words is seen in some circles as a mark of intelligence. That's not completely absurd, since vocabulary does correlate with reading, and knowledge of obscure topics will bring topic-related jargon. But a lot of the more absurd words seem to exist solely for the purpose of showing off that you know the words.


In my opinion, if you Google a word and the first few links are dictionary entries, then the word isn't really a functional part of the English language anymore, if it ever were. Its best ignored.

Slate,L,The new seven wonders: Defining the top technological marvels of the contemporary age.," The seven wonders of classical antiquity were architectural marvels, triumphs of human ego and raw power. The great achievements of today, however, are made possible by systems, infrastructure, and technologies that are invisible. Check back every week for a new wonder of the modern world.


1
The U.S. Aviation Control System













When the weather is clear and all systems are go, as many as 3,100 flights can take off and land each day at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, the busiest airport in the world. In recent years, the airport has expanded its flight capacity slightly, but not by increasing the number of runways. Watch the planes take off, and you might see a more subtle innovation.


Because air traffic controllers are now monitoring departing aircraft with GPS-based systems rather than radar, the planes follow much more precise and predictable pathssome straight ahead, others instead banking several degrees to the left or right. This more accurate tracking lets controllers release more planes for takeoff into the same airspace while maintaining the required separation distance of 3 horizontal miles and 1,000 vertical feet. By halving the time to clear the next flight for departure on some runways from two minutes to one, Atlanta controllers can now put as many as 12 more planes per hour into the heavens. 
























In many ways, flying has become an unpleasant, increasingly expensive, and frequently contentious effort. Americas airports feel like glorified bus stations in comparison to the sleek terminals of Asia and the Middle East. The consumer interface of air travelbag charges, humiliating security procedures, $8 stale sandwiches, evaporating leg roomcan seem as frenzied and dreadful as a Hieronymus Bosch painting.


But the carefully choreographed diversions on Atlantas runways, which shave just seconds off flights, are, in their own subtle way, as graceful as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and as awe-inspiring as the Colossus of Rhodes. Theyre one of the many remarkable aspects of an air-control regime that most people never noticea system that is one of the marvels of the modern world.


This series will explore seven of these new wonders: bewildering achievements, incredibly useful tools and services that we take for granted. None of them is monumental in scale, like the seven wonders of classical antiquity chronicled by Antipater of Sidon more than 2,000 years ago. The Great Pyramids of Giza and the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were feats of engineering, triumphs of man over nature and gravity, and above all accomplishments of ego and raw power. And the modern, man-made wonders we marvel atthe Brooklyn Bridge, the Hoover Dam, the Panama Canalare echoes of the ancient ones: breathtaking physical manifestations of human ingenuity. Todays wonders, in contrast, arent so in your face. Instead, theyre powered and made possible by systems, infrastructure, and technologies that are often invisible. The Lighthouse of Alexandria was a triumph of front-end, or consumer-facing, engineering, to use a Web developers terminology. But todays innovations, insights, and wonders can just as frequently be found in the back end, where we rarely notice them.



  Animation by Lisa Larson-Walker


 

Like the ancient wonders, this list is somewhat arbitrary. But there is a method to it. Sure, the world is filled with new, man-made wonders of an astounding scale, like the CCTV headquarters in Beijing and the Three Gorges Dam. But monumental buildings and dams have been done before, even millennia ago. Today, the point of buildings and infrastructure shouldnt be to impress but to connect. In the 21st century, our ability to thrive rests in large measure on the quality and power of the networks that transport data, information, and life-giving substances like water. Part of this seriess goal is to highlight systems that are overlooked or maligned yet remain both extraordinarily functional and vital to the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people.


Thats certainly the case with the U.S. aviation control system. With land and infrastructure dollars hard to come by, subtle upgrades to the operating system are effectively increasing the capacity of our airports and skies, making it all run more smoothly and safely.


In the U.S., air travel is a form of mass transit, so these efficiency improvements matter a great deal. In 2013, there were 21.58 million commercial flights, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. And serious glitches, on the ground and in the skies, have become more rare. Between 2007 and 2013, the likelihood of a piece of luggage being mislaid fell by more than halffrom a rate of 7.03 per 1,000 passengers to 3.22 per 1,000, as the Wall Street Journal reported. (That, in turn, is less than half the global rate of 6.96 per 1,000.)





The global system, of course, is far from foolproof, as the lost Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and its cousin shot down over the Ukraine made clear earlier this year. But in the U.S., the worlds busiest airspace, safety has improved dramatically. According to National Transportation Safety Board data, between 1994 and 2006 there were only two years in which no fatalities were recorded on scheduled commercial domestic flights. But in six of the last seven years, and in each of the past four, there have been none. Between 2010 and 2013, there were 2.94 billion passenger emplanements on scheduled commercial flightsabout 735 million annually. All those people reached their destinations alive, with just 12 injuries. (The 2009 Colgan Air crash outside Buffalo, New York, which killed 50 people, was the last major commercial disaster within our borders. There have been several fatal crashes involving cargo or chartered planes.*)


The air traffic control systemthe ground-based radar installations, the onboard navigation devices, the 264 FAA towers, and the software and networks that connect them and manage the movement of planesactually works remarkably well, even if widespread delays and cancellations sometimes lead us to curse the entire mode of transportation instead of marveling, as we once did, at the triumph of human flight. Traveling the skies may no longer feel like a miracle, but the systems that make it possible and increasingly more efficient deserve our adulation. Slowly, imperceptibly, and often invisibly, the FAA is rolling out what it calls the NextGen project, an alphabet soup of acronyms that describe a set of initiatives, procedures, and protocols that are improving the way we fly. Its not going to be the sort of thing where we flip a switch, FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto says. But we are going to phase out the old system.



  Animation by Lisa Larson-Walker


 

Though sturdy, the legacy systema network of ground-based radar stations that feed information to controllers, who then communicate with pilots over radiois like an analog system in an increasingly digital world. Ground-based radar signals degrade over distance and cant penetrate mountains. The stations cant be placed on water. And the radar updates only once every 4.7 seconds. All of which requires planes to stay farther apart from one another in the airclogging up vital air channelsand poses significant challenges in navigating over water, around weather, and in mountainous areas.


Increasingly, though, thats changing. As part of NextGen, a satellite-based system called Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B, will use GPS to locate planes and connect them to air traffic control. By Jan. 1, 2020, all aircraft flying in controlled airspace will be required to have ADS-B equipment. ADS-B is now enabling planes to fly around weather over open water in the Gulf of Mexicosaving time and fuel and sometimes completely sparing passengers from turbulence. And instead of exchanging vital information orallywhich ties up radio frequencies and can result in miscommunicationspilots and controllers will rely on powerful data transmission and processing systems. In 2013, introductory programs began in Memphis, Tennessee, and Newark, New Jersey, in which routine communicationsclearance to take off, a change in route to avoid a thunderstormwere effectively delivered to LCD screens via text updates.





    Advertisement




There are also smaller, localized fixes. In airports like the Yampa Valley Regional Airport, which services ski areas like Steamboat Springs, Colorado, delays and cancellations play havoc with schedules during the peak season, in large measure because radar isnt very good at tracking planes as they negotiate mountainous areas. As part of a small-scale experiment, the FAA deployed a bunch of sensors in the area to form a network, called wide area multilateration, that can keep much better tabs on planes. The upshot: Yampa Valley can handle 15 to 20 arrivals safely each hour in conditions that would have previously required planes to be diverted to other airports.


Throughout the air traffic control system, new protocolsbased in part on new technology and on research and analysiseffectively expand flight capacity by enabling planes to flow in and out of airports and airspaces more quickly and with fewer hitches. At Boston Logan and other airports, GPS-based systems that allow for more precise tracing of planes mean they can now land when visibility is as low as 1,800 feetcompared with the prior standard of 2,400 feet.


At John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, where the traffic on the runways has often rivaled that on the New Jersey Turnpike, controllers are now using a virtual queuing system. By forecasting traffic through historical data, they assign 15-minute slots to flights up to two hours in advance. Rather than leave the gate and sit on the runway, planes wait with their engines off until their appointed times. That saves fuel (since they can run systems on electric power at the gate) and reduces congestion in the taxi areas.



  Wake turbulence can be hazardous, with the potential to overturn smaller airplanes without warning. Photo by Etienne De Malglaive/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images


 

Meanwhile, changes in technology and the addition of smaller jets to Americas aviation fleet have led controllers to re-examine the effects of wake turbulencethe vortexes that planes leave in their wake when they take off. In certain instances, as when smaller jets are in a queue behind aircraft of the same size, the FAA has concluded that its safe to let planes begin taking off right after the ones in front of them have left the ground, instead of waiting the traditional three minutes. When it was first tested in Memphis, wake recategorization effectively boosted capacity of runways by up to 20 percent. After controllers in Atlanta started using recategorization in June, it evoked a sense of wonder in the industry. That is saving a minute or a minute and a half right there, said Mark Hopkins, Deltas director of air traffic management. This is eye-opening.


Taken individuallya minute saved here, a few hundred of feet of visibility added there, several gallons of fuel conserved somewhere elsethese improvements may not seem to add up to much. But just as a small delay in a complex system can lead to further delays, small innovations can have powerful knock-on effects. These incremental fixes, all rolled out with little notice, highlight how our more reliable and efficient aviation system has become a modern marvel. And impressively, the FAA is slowly pushing through its immense upgrades while operating at full-tilt in a highly safe and surprisingly effective manner. Thats like replacing the George Washington Bridge in its entirety without lane closures or new traffic problems.


In an age in which constricted financial resources and geographic footprints prevent us from expanding the physical footprint of airports, the highly resilient and evolving air traffic control system is doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes. We should look up in awe.

The seven wonders of classical antiquity were architectural marvels, triumphs of human ego and raw power. The great achievements of today, however, are made possible by systems, infrastructure, and technologies that are invisible. This series, which began with the U.S. aviation control system, explores the wonders of our modern world. Here is the second wonder:

The Dynamic Map






In the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in the autumn of 2012, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had no idea which gas stations were open or closed in the greater New York area. With widespread flooding and electricity outages, and with downed trees blocking roads, there was no wayshort of the slow task of dialing up each stationto swiftly determine which ones had gas or even power. So FEMA contacted Waze, a free navigation app that allows users to anonymously post data about traffic incidents and edit maps. Waze sent a push notice to drivers, asking them to share the status of stations in their neighborhoods. The app then updated its maps to show pins on stations that were up and running. After quickly cataloging the information, Waze zapped it to FEMA in an Excel file, which helped the agency effectively dispatch tanker trucks to replenish supplies.

Waze has grown rapidly since its founding in 2008 by Amir Shinar and Ehud Shabtai, Israeli computer experts who were dissatisfied with the global positioning systems in their cars. When Los Angeles shut down the I-405 in the July 2012 Carmageddon, Waze users provided traffic information more effectively than traffic helicopters could. In fall 2012, when Tim Cook publicly apologized for the debacle of Apple Maps, he recommended Waze as an alternative. The service now claims more than 50 million users in 45 languages, in 200 countries. Last year, Google acquired Waze for a price reported at about $1 billion. While big tech companies often buy startups only to absorb their innovations and shutter them, Google has made Waze part of the family. The app has incorporated Google Street View and hired more people, while Google Maps has added Waze data on traffic and street closures.


It might be easier to appreciate todays browser- and app-based dynamic maps and the systems and devices that power themWaze and Google Maps, but also Scout, Polaris, TomTom, Garmin, and Magellanas wonders of the modern world if, like me, youre old enough to remember when planning a cross-country driving trip meant visiting a AAA office to get a Trip-Tik (a set of highlighted maps). Even with paper maps, in some ways drivers were flying blind. Beyond periodic traffic updates on the radio, there was virtually no real-time information available about road closures, accidents, constructionthe phenomena that can turn an easy 15-minute trip into a grinding two-hour ordeal. As recently as a decade ago, a driver departing Montclair, New Jersey, would have no idea whether it made more sense to take the Garden State Parkway or the New Jersey Turnpike.

But in recent years, individuals have been able to tap into the technology that was once the exclusive preserve of the military. Like so many other staples of consumer lifefrom CorningWare to the InternetGPS has its origins in Cold Warera military research. After the shock of Sputnik, the Pentagon began working on ways to use orbiting satellites to help fix the positions of submarines and other naval vessels. A network of several satellites in the 1960s, known as Transit, was augmented by the NAVSTAR system, the construction of which began in the 1970s.


Todays GPS apps and devices reach to the heavens to help us navigate our little corners of the Earth. We can know that traffic is seriously backed up on the southbound lanes of I-95 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, because a car is broken down on the side of the road, that a tow truck has just arrived, and that it makes sense to jump onto Route 1 and then re-enter I-95 a few miles later in Fairfield. These mostly free services are some of the most valuablebut difficult to valuecomponents of the so-called consumer surplus that our modern information economy provides.


With its singular combination of technology, human intelligence, and curation, Waze illustrates the awe-inspiring potential of the dynamic map better than any of its competitors. And the attributes that make the app so popularthink Wikipedia or Pinterest, but for traffic and mapsare highly visible. But just like Americas increasingly sophisticated air traffic control system, which I explored in the first part of this series, Waze is a back-end marvel. Unlike the Great Pyramid of Giza or the other seven wonders of antiquity, its most amazing innovations are invisible.


Most GPS-based navigation and traffic apps rely on road cameras and sensors on highly trafficked roads and are updated every five minutes or so. I find its not uncommon for me to check out traffic on MapQuest or Google Maps before leaving the house only to find Connecticuts Merritt Parkway is surprisingly backed up a few minutes later. Waze aims to provide more useful, actionable information by instantly updating data and contextprovided by both machines and humansvia a cute, friendly interface. (Of course, as is the case with many free apps and publications, the user experience is occasionally disrupted by pop-up ads.)


Wazes back end, obviously, includes the network of Google servers, wireless stations, satellites, and software code that powers it. But thats just the beginning. Massive, open public editing of a site can be a road to misinformation and mischiefjust read any Internet comments section or contentious Wikipedia page.Waze overlays its data with a constant stream of user-submitted comments, then runs them through systems it has built to channel and reward human behavior.Then it figures out how to make this system do useful work in the world. All of this happens behind the scenes.
























Part of Wazes back end is passive. When a Waze user turns on a phone and opens the app, Waze pings the phones GPS chip every second and recalculates traffic every three minutes. The simple act of driving with the app open turns users into traffic reportersconfirming they are on the road and giving an indication of speed. Scale makes this passive crowdsourcing useful. On an average day in Rio de Janeiro, 110,000 active Waze drivers cover 1.2 million kilometers. The data isnt just broadcast, however. Waze feeds it into algorithms that enable it to conduct predictive modeling based on past experience. So when somebody maps a prospective route through Rio, Waze can produce suggestions based on reported traffic conditions and on how long it typically takes drivers to negotiate the routes at that time of day. (In an update earlier this year, Google Maps integrated the ability to change routes on the fly in reaction to traffic snarls.)


Part of the appeal of Waze is that users can report incidentstraffic, congestion, a mattress in the roadthat instantly generate icons on its maps. On a typical day in Rio, users actively report about 58,000 incidents. But in the back end, not all incident reports are treated equally. Waze has built a system that evaluates users capacity, experience, and accuracy, weighing the information they provide accordingly. Like many social apps, Waze allows users the opportunity to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to posts. Reports by users who frequently file incidents that are routinely confirmed by others will be weighted higher, while Waze gives less trust to people who consistently file false alarms.


Mapping the world and charting its traffic problems are extraordinarily labor-intensive undertakings. Thats where Wazes human back end comes into play. The company has about 160 employees, divided between Tel Aviv, Israel; New York; and Mountain View, California. But the mapa breathing organism that constantly evolves to ensure the accuracy of street names, housing numbers, and construction sitesis maintained by a community of 200,000 volunteer map editors. Editorsanybody can sign upstart by making notations about their immediate area. We dont manage them, we dont pay them, we dont tell them what to do, says JulieMossler, a Waze spokeswoman. But the company doesnt have an entirely hands-off attitude. People who have made 1 million edits or more are considered champs, and they have a direct line to the company. And Waze now provides support to a group of editors based in Italy who are starting a project to map Africa more accurately.


While Waze could function perfectly well without much human intervention from its headquarters, its competitive advantage and utility arise in part from the relationships its staff cultivates and their ability to inject human intelligence into the systemwhether its reaching out to Los Angeles authorities during Carmageddon or working with FEMA to generate lists of open gas stations. In early October, when a Waze staffer learned that President Obama was visiting San Francisco, the app sent a push notice to advise users in the area to get out on the roads a little earlier. And the company just set up a partnershipConnected Citizenin which it will provide traffic data to cities like Tel Aviv; Barcelona, Spain; and San Jose, Costa Rica in exchange for more immediate access to information on issues like road closures or construction. All of which proves that even in a highly wired and automated world, personal and institutional relationships can be a vital part of infrastructure.

Government is supposed to step in during a market failure. But Waze shows how the market can correct for government failure. The app is extremely popular in Costa Rica. Why? In a nation where authorities havent bothered to name many roads and streets and paper maps are unreliable, Waze volunteers have effectively functioned as a sort of public agency. In places where the grid has yet to be captured, Waze isnt an adjunct to mapsit is the map. Waze has become such a part of the culture that businesses will even list their addresses in advertisements as locations that can be searched for on Waze, the Washington Post reported recently.


Waze likely wont be around forever, but its many features, some subtle and some outright mind-bending, suggest that the maps we rely on every day are only going to get more sophisticated, data-rich, and, yes, wondrous. Its easy to imagine the maps of the future being studded and layered with information on Wi-Fi hot spots, crime data, public transit schedules, and weather. Harry Potters Marauders Map, which allowed him to see who was scurrying around Hogwarts late at night, will have nothing on the amazing, thoroughly unmagical cartographic apps in our pockets.


Already, as I pull out of my driveway, I can know that traffic is dragging at an 8-mile clip on the Post Road in downtown Westport, Connecticut, which means I should use a back roads cut-through. I can expect that repair teams have arrived for the bridge project on I-95 north, which is keeping traffic running at a pokey 23 miles per hour. And I can prepare to accelerate to above 40 miles per hour right after the underpassthat last tip courtesy of a Waze user whose avatar includes sunglasses and a little sword.


In another era, the sunglasses-and-swords guy might have been adding blocks to the Great Pyramid. These days, hes contributing to our modern maps achievement of near omniscience in a chaotic, ever-changing system.

Theseven wondersof classical antiquity were architectural marvels, triumphs of human ego and raw power. The great achievements of today, however, are made possible by systems, infrastructure, and technologies that are invisible. This series, which continued last week with GPS-powered dynamic maps, explores the wonders of our modern world. Here is the third wonder:

The Undersea Information Highway






Ever think twice about our superfast data connections? Email accounts. Skype chats. Stock quotes. The latest Taylor Swift video on YouTube. All would have been either impossible or extremely expensive 25 years ago. All are free and available at any timeon a handheld device, on our desktops. Our words, ideas, emotions, and emoticons travel at the speed of light, from pretty much any point on the surface of the Earth to any other.


We may live in a mobile and wireless world, but wires still drive the global communications revolution. Your phone call, text, email, or emoji-laden tweet may travel wirelessly from your iPhone to the nearest cellular tower, but from there on out it is largely confined to cables, wires, and cordsexpress lanes coursing above ground, underground, and under the seaespecially if your message is going abroad. More than 99 percent of signals of any sort that go between continents flow over undersea fiber-optic cables, says Tim Stronge, research analyst at TeleGeography, a research and consulting firm. Were submarine cables not as pervasive, cheap, and functional as they are, most of us would still be living on data islands. To the extent that the world is now flat, it is largely due to the expansive network of undersea cables. They enable a dot-com entrepreneur in Perth, Australia, to collaborate with a programmer in Bangalore, India, serve a customer in Germany, and communicate with a supplier in China.
























These contemporary Appian Ways are the vital back end of the Internetand one of the wonders of the modern world. Lying under the murky depths of the Southern Atlantic, the placid, teal waters of the Caribbean, and the frigid, stormy Bering Sea, underwater cables withstand the ravages of sharks and resist immense pressure and the corroding influence of salt. Amid the sprawling network (laid out in this gorgeous map produced by TeleGeography), one stands out for its length. Starting in Australia and terminating in Germany, SEA-ME-WE 3 (for SouthEast Asia Middle East Western Europe) is a modern-day Orient Express. A marvel of modern synergy, it was built (and is still owned) by a consortium of 92 telecommunications firms. Running 39,000 kilometersabout 24,000 milesand touching 39 landing points in 33 countries on four continents, SEA-ME-WE 3 is the closest thing we have to a transoceanic information superhighway.


Todays submarine cables are the latest flowering of an infrastructure class that was pioneered in the 19th century, given impetus by a construction boom in the late 20th century, and which has been made immensely more powerful (and cheaper) by 21st-century technology developments. Indeed, thanks to the application of new hardware and processes, a cable like SEA-ME-WE 3 can now carry 40 times more data than it could when it was first laida feat that physical conduits for physical goods, like roads and railways, could never mimic.

The first great submarine communication cable, of course, was the telegraph line connecting England and the United States. In A Thread Across the Ocean: The Heroic Story of the Transatlantic Cable, John Steele Gordon describes how Cyrus Field rounded up cash and got the U.S. and U.K. governments to fund his scheme. (The Niagara, the largest ship in the U.S. Navy, laid out the cable.) The first message sent from Queen Victoria to President James Buchanan, in August 1858, inspired fireworks in New York City that set City Hall on fire. In a remark Tom Friedman might have appreciated, Cyrus Fields brother, Henry, wrote that it joins the sundered hemispheres. It unites distant nations, making them feel that they are members of one great family. Three weeks later, the cable went dead. Tiffany & Co. bought parts of the unused cable and cut them into 4-inch pieces to sell. (One was auctioned on eBay last year.) Field finally succeeded in laying a lasting cable in 1866. The cost for capacity: $10 a word. By 1900, there were 15 competing threads across the ocean.


Laid in 1956, TAT-1, the first transatlantic telephone cable, used the same type of copper wire employed in terrestrial phone lines. But the midcentury threads were exceedingly narrow pipe. TAT-1 could accommodate just 48 64 kbps (kilobits per second) circuitsjust four dozen phone conversations at once. Its not surprising, then, that in the 1960s international phone calls cost about $3 per minute. The development of fiber-optic cable by Corning in the 1960s and 1970s (chronicled in a chapter in a book I wrote)using glass as a transport medium rather than a metalbrought a quantum leap in the speed and capacity for communication wires. Fiber-optic cableinsanely thin glass threads, reallycan handle so many more conversations and bits than wireless spectra can. The first fiber-optic cable laid across the Atlantic, the TAT-8, was completed in 1988 and could carry 7,560 simultaneous voice conversations.





The 1990s brought a boom in both the pace of construction and the power and capacity of cables. The AC-1 trans-Atlantic cable, an 8,700-mile round-trip line first used in 1998, could handle the equivalent of 483,840 simultaneous voice conversations, according to Stronge. Firms like Global Crossing, whose market capitalization peaked at $45 billion in the spring of 2000, laid pipe anywhere and everywhereand then went bust.











SEA-ME-WE 3 began amid the tech bubble. Australia and the rest of Oceania are separated from other huge commercial and population centers by vast expanses of water. Australias line to the other six continents was an analog line, the AIS (Australia-Indonesia-Singapore) cable. Construction of SEA-ME-WE 3, which started in January 1997 and was completed in 2000, proceeded in a way that would have been recognizable to 19th-century telegraph cable experts. As Stronge notes, when cable is loaded onto a vessel, They have this giant drum in the ship and hire people to walk the cable around in a concentric circle.


The ships proceeded methodically, paying out cable that is the width of a garden hosean outer diameter of 21 millimeters, to be preciseand encased in a plastic coating. From Perth, SEA-ME-WE 3 goes north. At Malaysia, a branch reaches out to East Asia, surfacing at Mersing, Indonesia; Danang Vietnam; and Shanghai. Across the northern stretches of the Indian Ocean it goes, hitting Sri Lanka, Mumbai, and Karachi, further west to Muscat and Djibouti City, before crooking up through the Red Sea and Suez Canal. From Alexandria, Egypt, it hits Mediterranean ports of call before wheeling around Iberia and France, finally ending in the chilly waters of the North Sea near Norden, Germany.


For most of its sojourn, SEA-ME-WE 3 lies on the bottom of the murky depths. In deep watermore than 3,000 metersthe cables are laid on the seabed. In shallower waters, where ships might snag them, a plow buries them. SEA-ME-WE 3 has two fiber pairs, and such cables often have copper running through themwhich supplies the electricity that powers repeaters, small devices positioned every 50 kilometers that boost the signal. At certain points, the cable is up-armoredcoated in metal tape, sheathing, or screensto protect against potential dangers. (The extra screen helps shield electromagnetic waves that attract sharks.) While failures are often ascribed to monsters of the deep gnawing through them, Stronge says such instances are rare. There was one famous incident in the 1980s when a cable failed, and they think it was because a shark had bitten through to where the electricity was flowing. When links break or are severed, as has happened on SEA-ME-WE 3 on about a half-dozen occasions, ships are sent out to repair the damage. (Fishing nets and ship anchors account for most of these incidents.) The sea cables are connected to beach manholes at the shore, through which they connect to land cables and the broader terrestrial grids.

The global economy has benefited from the boom in cable construction. Immense excess capacity, combined with technological improvements, has led to falling prices. The stupidity of investors and the willingness of bondholders and stockholders to sacrifice their money so that others could have cheap communications infrastructure are dynamics weve seen in the telegraph and railroad industries. (I wrote a book about this, too.) Prices for capacity are one one-thousandth what they were in the late 1990s, Stronge says. Since 1997, the amount of lit capacityi.e., the amount being usedin the Atlantic Ocean between the U.S. and Europe has risen from 33 gigabits per second to 27 terabits per second, an 818-fold increase. But, notes Stronge, the total capacity of all cablesincluding dark fiber thats not in useacross the Atlantic is 173 terabits per second, which means just 16 percent is being used. On major submarine cable routes, bandwidth demand rose 4.5 times between 2009 to 2013. But even so, less than one-quarter of the potential capacity on these routes is being used. Every year, the price of connections grows cheaper. According to TeleGeography, median monthly lease prices on major submarine cable routes submarine cables fell between 10 and 26 percent in 2013.


Thats in part because the state-owned and private telecom companies that have built and run the global network continue to add to it, especially in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. (SEA-ME-WE 3 was followed by SEA-ME-WE 4, which provided redundancy along similar paths, from Singapore to France.) But its also because innovation on the back end has increased the carrying capacity of tubes that were laid down long ago. When SEA-ME-WE 3 was completed, it could carry up to 40 gigabits per second of data traffic. Today, SingTel, which runs the cable, says it has a capacity of 1 terabit per seconda 25-fold increase. Thats in large measure due to the introduction of wavelength division multiplexing. Essentially, a bunch of signals can now travel on the same pair of fiber cables because new, more powerful transceivers on the ends of cable lines can send and receive the signal on different frequencies of light. As SingTel notes, The cable has been twice upgraded and it now consists of two fiber pairs, each carrying eight wavelengths.

To the history-minded, the map of submarine cables is remarkably evocative. A host of them connects the Northeastern U.S. with England and France, mimicking the early patterns of North America settlement. Some follow the journeys of Vasco Da Gama and Magellan, bumping down from Portugal along the coast toward South Africa. There are tiny components like the Amerigo Vespucci, an 85-kilometer spur that connects Curacao, a former Dutch colony, to Bonaire, which is still part of the Netherlands. There are unlikely hubs, like Bude, at the tip of Cornwall in England, where seven cables arrive from across the seas. Like triremes, schooners, and clippers before them, these cables hug land and then seek direct, obstacle-free paths across the waters. But instead of delivering physical goods, they deliver digital goods and services.


Like all good networks, the mesh of submarine cables is being expanded to offer more capacity and more redundancy. The SEA-ME-WE 5, now under construction, parallels a good chunk of SEA-ME-WE 3 between Malaysia and France. And while its difficult to improve much on the speed of light, the network is getting marginally faster. It takes about 60 milliseconds to bounce a signal from New York to London. But for some users of bandwidth, particularly banks that are doing trading or arbitrage, shaving off one millisecond can make huge profits, Stronge says. Thats why Hibernia Networks is now working on Project Express, a cable that will carve a shorter path across the Atlanticfrom Halifax in Nova Scotia to the west coast of England. 


SEA-ME-WE 3 and its siblings may not be any more effective than the telegraph in joining sundered hemispheres or making distant nations feel like one great family. But they make it possible for us to lead 21st-century lives, at faster and faster speeds. And they should inspire the same type of awe that a 19th-century telegraph cable did. These are the days of miracle and wonder, Paul Simon once sang. This is the long-distance call.

Slate,L,Barnes & Noble buys out Microsoft's Nook stake to prepare for e-reader spinoff.,"The decline of Barnes & Noble's beleaguered Nook has been slow and steady. The e-reader, first introduced in October 2009 as a response to Amazon's Kindle, stumbled from the get-go. In late June Barnes & Noble announced it would spin off the Nook unit completely. And as a step toward that, the company said Thursday that it has ended a partnership with Microsoft in the Nook business.

Microsoft invested $300 million in Nook in 2012 in exchange for a 17.6 percent stake. Even then, Barnes & Noble was already looking into spinning off the unit, but appeared ready to reconsider after the Microsoft cash infusion. Then, this March, Barnes & Noble and Microsoft decided to scale back their partnership by ending work on Nook apps for Windows computers, phones, and tablets. At the time, Barnes & Noble said in a statement that it looked forward to continuing the partnership with Microsoft and ""expanding the availability of Nook content.""

Barnes & Noble is purchasing Microsoft's stake for about $125 million in cash and stock. Michael Huseby, Barnes & Noble's chief executive, said in a statement that the split will help Barnes & Noble ""further rationalize the Nook business and provide a clearer path for the potential separation of our retail and Nook media businesses."" Microsoft said in its own statement that ""as the respective business strategies of each company evolved, we mutually agreed that it made sense to terminate the agreement."" The Nook spinoff, initially announced for March 2015, is now expected to be complete by the end of August.



The announcement about the Microsoft partnership was tucked into the second quarter earnings report that Barnes & Noble released Thursday. Over the past three months, the Nook's revenues fell 41.3 percent to $63.9 million. Barnes & Noble's overall revenues also declined 2.7 percent to $1.69 billion. The only bright spot for the bookstore in the latest quarter was its college arm, which posted a 1.9 percent increase in revenue to $751.3 million. Barnes & Noble will have to wait until its next earnings report to see whether the holiday season and a clever signed-books promotion on Black Friday can give a much-needed boost to its sales.



As for now, shares of the bookstore chain are down nearly 10 percent in midday trading, to $20.09. Despite that, Barnes & Noble has performed fairly well this year, with its stock up more than 30 percent since January.

Slate,L,Katrina Arnold photographs New Orleans Ladies Arm Wrestling tournaments.  ,"When Katrina Arnold photographed a ladies arm wrestling brawl in New Orleans a few years ago, she was instantly hooked. The raucous events, which are hosted byNew Orleans Ladies Arm Wrestling, combine the performative, athletic elements of a WWE match with the communal, boozy aspects of a trivia night. Its one of more than 25 chapters across the world under the umbrella of theCollective of Lady Arm Wrestlers.

They're such colorful events. You never know what's going to happen, Arnold said. I got addicted. I ended up joining the collective and taking pictures of my friends.

At NOLAWs events, which are held a few times a year at bars, galleries, and other spaces across the city, eight arm wrestlerseach with their own costumed persona, theme song, and entouragecompete before hundreds of spectators. According to NOLAW, rules are determined and managed by the referee, only to be manipulated and corrupted by celebrity judges, crowd hecklers, and dolla billz.

The events arent just fun and games. Theyre also fundraisers, with all proceeds benefiting local groups supporting women and children. (The groups, in return, create the winners trophy and submit a member to wrestle in the tournament.)

Photographing arm wrestling, Arnold said, is like photographing a concert: It involves shooting fast-moving subjects in low light, as well as avoiding getting in the way of audience members. Still, she said, NOLAWs events are a photographers dream. Hilarious wrestler alter egosBabe Lincoln, Amelia Armheart, Ruth Hater Ginsburgcome with equally outrageous costumes and stunts as they prepare to compete. Half-time acts include drag queens and burlesque dancers. Crowds are loud and enthusiastic.


We want to create a fun, safe atmosphere where we can show off these strong, empowered women doing something that allows them to act out however they want, she said. You can be sexy, strong funnyyou create a character. The best part is seeing these expressions come out on stage. It's more about performance than the actual arm wrestling.

Slate,L,Holiday season hacking: Beware of malware and phishing in order confirmation emails.,"Ordering gifts online for family and friends this holiday season? Inbox inundated with confirmation emails? You could be the perfect target for holiday hackers.

Brian Krebs at Krebs on Security is warning that consumers be on high alert this month for malicious links and attachments in emails purporting to ""confirm"" online orders. ""Malware purveyors and spammers are blasting these missives by the millions each day in a bid to trick people into giving up control over their computers and identities,"" Krebs writes. His post shows a series of somewhat convincing malware emails that appear to come from Home Depot, Walmart, Target, and Costco.

Holiday hacking is a perennial problem for both customers and retailers. As transaction volume rises, retailers will often lower their fraud controls so that the sales can continue apace. This creates a window for hackers to strike and get away undetected. Krebs notes that the particular breed of ""order confirmation"" spam emails tends to start around Thanksgiving and run through the end of the winter holidays. The phishing attacks use ""both booby-trapped links and attached files"" to put malware on computers that can then pull passwords and other important information from the machines.



Huge security breaches have already hit JPMorgan Chase and Home Depot this year. Last winter, Target suffered an attack that compromised the credit and debit cards of 40 million people and the personal information of 70 million. From January through the end November, a record 696 data breaches were reported and nearly 81.5 million records exposed, according to data from the Identity Theft Resource Center. The previous record for most breaches in a year was 662 breaches in 2010.


So go ahead and shop online for the holidays. But when the order confirmations start to pile up, be very, very careful about what you end up clicking.

Slate,L,Transparents Zackary Drucker wants to archive Flawless Sabrinas lifework.,"Back in October, Outward ran a piece from Stephen Vider on the opening credits for Transparent, the critically acclaimed Amazon show that follows the story of Maura (an older transgender woman) and her coming-out process. Vider unearthed a wonderful bit of queer history hiding in the frames: Segments from The Queen, a seminal but largely unseen documentary about drag queens and trans people from 1968, were cut into the montage, helping it show how trans identities and communities have evolved, both in the decades since the documentarys release and over the years of Mauras life. In the piece, Vider also wrote about the main force behind The Queen, Flawless Sabrina (aka Jack Doroshow), a drag performer and activst who ran the groundbreaking pageant documented in the film.

Viders coverage necessarily focused on that particular aspect of Flawless life, butThe Queen was only the beginning of the queen's illustrious career. As Zackary Drucker, an associate producer on Transparent and grandchild of Flawless, points out in an ongoing Kickstarter project to archive her grandmothers lifework, Flawless is a living legend in the queer community who has worked tirelessly for decades shaping culture to be safer for LGBT people.

Along with Diana Tourjeea writer who is working on a book about FlawlessDrucker is raising funds to enable the cataloging and preservation of the masses of historically significant art, documents, and other artifacts that currently reside in the queens small New York apartment. This is both to help her downsize and to make the materials available to scholars, activists, and other parties interested in the history of gender and countercultures. Additionally, the archive will include extensive oral history interviews with Flawless. 


Having had the privilege of spending a number of stimulating afternoons on the far side of Flawless desk, I can vouch for the supreme importance of this project. Sources of LGBTQ history are precious, so when we are presented with both a treasure trove and a generous, intelligent elder who is willing to help us understand it all, we should jump at the opportunity. The fundraising campaign will run until Monday, Dec. 8.

Slate,L,"Pink slugs, drunken parrots, giant earthworms, and tree lobsters of Australia.","Atlas Obscura onSlateis a blog about the world's hidden wonders. Like us onFacebookandTumblr, or follow us onTwitter.

Australia is renowned for being being filled with dangerous animals that cant wait to kill you. Snakes, spiders, sharks, box jellyfish, and blue-ringed octopuses are but a few of the fauna that have the power to end you. But the country is also home to a menagerie of vibrant and fascinating creatures that are much more benignat least to humans. Here are five of them.


The Giant Pink Slugs of Mount Kaputar
Mount Kaputar, an alpine peak in the southeastern state of New South Wales, is home to a plucky band of neon-pink slugs. Resembling glistening strips of raw tuna, these slugs can grow to over 7 inches long. They usually hide out under the leaves whose mold they feed upon, but at night they emerge by the hundreds, slithering around in search of tasty moss.


    Advertisement




The slugs are the most striking residents of Mount Kaputar, but by no means the only unusual animal. Three species of cannibalistic snails live on the mountain, always chasing after one anothers slime trails.


The Drunk Parrots of the Northern Territory
Australias binge-drinking culture is not confined to its human inhabitants. Every October, when the wet season arrives in Australias north, drunk parrots begin falling from the trees. The birds are red-collared lorikeets who feed on fermented fruit and get, in the words of Australian Geographic, completely sloshed, and sometimes for days at a time.

Rotten fruit may not the sole reason the parrots get blotto. The lethargy and loss of coordination could also be symptoms of a virus that vets have not yet been able to identify. Whatever the cause, the effects are serious: The birds can die if left untreated. (As with human hangovers, treatment involves hydration, rest, and comfort food.)


The Giant Earthworms of Gippsland
The Gippsland earthworms are so big that when they were discovered in the 1870s they were initially mistaken for snakes. Inhabiting the blue-gray clay of Gippsland in the state of Victoria, the earthworms are an average of 1 inch wide and 3 feet long, but in rare, horrifying instances, can exceed 9 feet. 


The worms spend most of their lives buried deep in their burrows, where they squelch around in the wet earth making impressive gurgling sounds. This clip from David Attenboroughs BBC series Life in the Undergrowth provides an intimate portrait of the earthworms.


&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;


The Lobsterlike Stick Insects of Balls Pyramid
Balls Pyramid, an 1,844-foot sea spire 12 miles off the east coast of Australia, is hardly lush with vegetationit is almost entirely rock, its near-vertical cliff faces inhospitable to fauna and off-limits to mountain climbers without government permission. But in 2001, scientists scaling the rock found something wonderful: a nest of 24 Lord Howe stick insects, a lobster-esque species long thought to be extinct.

In 2003 a team from the National Parks and Wildlife Service scaled the pyramid and collected two pairs of stick insects for breeding in captivity. One pair died shortly after, but the pair dispatched to Melbourne ZooAdam and Evemet with success, producing eggs that became the foundation of the zoos now thousands-strong tree lobster population.


The Seething Crab Hordes of Christmas Island
For most of the year, the red crabs of Christmas Island, an Australian territory located to the countrys northwest, wander the forests unobtrusively. But when the wet season arrives in October, the crabs stream toward the ocean to breed and lay eggs, turning the ground, grass, and roads into a crawling red carpet.

The crabs have a tiny but lethal enemy: yellow crazy ants, which were introduced to the island in the 1920s and have since wreaked havoc on its ecosystem. The ants shoot jets of formic acid into the crabs eyes, causing harm or even death. Yellow crazy ants have been such a menace to Christmas Islands ecology that the Australian government established a seven-member Crazy Ant Scientific Advisory Panel in order to come up with harm-reduction strategies. Ant super-colonies were blasted with insecticide in 2009, but the little blighters numbers are rising again.

Slate,L,Dr. Ben Carson blames feminism and the 60s for police shootings of unarmed black men.,"When cops gun down unarmed black men (or, in some cases, children), conservatives cast around desperately for someone besides the actual triggerman to blame. Now conservative commentator and Fox News stalwart Dr. Ben Carson has stumbled on an exciting anyone-but-the-shooter scapegoat: feminists. Carson was being interviewed by phone onAmerican Family Radios Todays Issues to elaborate on his theory that police shootings are the result of insufficient deference to authority on the part of young black men.

Slate,L,Slate recommendations: Favorite media recommendations from staffers this Thanksgiving. ,"In true Thanksgiving tradition, Slate Plus asked Slate staffers to share what theyre most thankful for in the media world this year. Here are the websites, podcasts, apps, and more that Slate-sters said filled them up with gratitude.

June Thomas, culture critic and Outward editor


Ive been a stationery nerd for as long as I can remember, but 2014 was the year I discovered a genre that marries two of my great loves: writing instruments and podcasts. The Pen Addict podcast is more than two years old, but every week pen blogger Brad Dowdy and podcast entrepreneur Myke Hurley, spend an hour or so prattling on delightfully about the analogue tools we love so dearly. A newer arrival on the scene is Erasable, a biweekly show by and for those who love wooden pencils. The three hostsJohnny Gamber, Tim Wasem, and Andy Welfieare graphite-obsessed, funny, and great company.

This Thanksgiving, I am grateful for science Twitter. Theres a huge community of science writers, students, scientists, and others who just love talking on Twitter about science and who use Twitter very effectively to stick up for science and justice. One of my favorite recent science Twitter eruptions was Manicure Monday, when scientists hijacked a Seventeen magazine hashtag to show off all the fun stuff you can do with your hands that doesnt involve nail polish.More recently, after an astronomer wore a sexy ladies shirt while announcing the landing of a spacecraft on a comet, science Twitter came up with a great hashtag, #scishirt, for scientists to show off their geekiest, funniest, nonsexist-iest shirts. Speaking of which, I need to go tweet a photo of my Teach the Controversy T-shirts.


Katy Waldman, words correspondent


Two podcasts Im loving (and Im sure Im very late to both of them!): Nerdette, hosted by Greta Johnsen and Tricia Bobeda, and Pitch, from Whitney Jones and Alex Kapelman. The first is just fascinating, good-humored interviews with the creators of nerd culturedefined broadly as anything you might get excited aboutand the second is music history and theory plus lovely, evocative production. (Don't miss the delightful episode in which second-graders create sound poems by interpreting wiggly lines as vocal scores!)


Aisha Harris, staff writer


I am thankful for the sitehttp://genekellysbutt.tumblr.com/. Anyone whos ever watched a Gene Kelly movie can attest to the wonderfulness that is (was?) his posterior. That such a shrine to one of cinemas greatest gifts actually exists is a testament to the social good the Internet can accomplish.

Dan Kois, culture editor


I am thankful for Clickhole. Nearly every day, the Onions new parody viral site (and viral parody site) publishes something that makes me laugh while simultaneously throwing my hands up in the air like LOL NOTHING MATTERS.


Rachael Larimore, senior editor


For years, Ive been resentful of Pinterest. Its the territory in the mommy wars that has been staked out by smug stay-at-home moms who can craft homemade, hand-sculpted, multitiered birthday cakes. With rolled fondant! I effing hate fondant. But then I told my youngest son, 5, that I would make him a Minecraft Halloween costume. Not a terribly hard taskcardboard boxes, colored duct tape, a few hours of timebut time consuming, and I wanted some tips. So I sucked it up and actually registered. Pinned a few things. Survived Halloween. But as it turns out, there are plenty of things to check out on Pinterest that are not in any way smug or obnoxious. And as the mom of three picky eaters, Im happy to search for recipes without trekking back and forth to the library for cookbooks. Even if they end up appealing only to me. Plus, there are cocktails.


Betsy Woodruff, staff writer


I am profoundly grateful for the Umbrella app. Its one of the few apps on my phone that I actually paid for (I think it was $2), and its more than worth it. The app sends an alert in the morning if its going to rain and, thus, if I should bring an umbrella to work. Life before this app was bleak, fraught, risky, and often drenched. Now that I have it, I no longer make frantic sprints to CVS to buy crappy $8umbrellasthatfall apart after three uses.I dont know what this says about my life, but Umbrella has genuinely improved it.


Abby McIntyre, copy editor


This year Im thankful for discovering, by way of their excellent book #Newsfail, the daily podcast Citizen Radio. Filled in equal parts with hilarious improv bits and radical progressive politics, its an incredibly fun way to get an outside-the-mainstream look at the days news.

Chris Kirk, interactives editor


Sure, thepodcast renaissanceis spawninggreat new podcasts likeSerialand The Gist, but sometimestheold stuff works just as well. Its a good thingDan Carlins Hardcore History podcast has been aroundsince 2006;Carlin bringsharsh, appallinghistory to life, and after you finish his latest series on World War I, you'll find yourselfplunging into those eight years of archivesand even payingfor old episodes, for another fix. Youll not only come away with a fascination with history you havent felt since you had that one hippie-hairedhistory teacherin high school, youll feel a new appreciation for the modern world and its relatively trivial worries.


Jennifer Lai, associate editor


This year, Im eternally grateful to Pocket, a free read-it-later app that has truly saved me from countless hours of heartbreak and frustration. Before discovering Pocket, I always felt overwhelmed by all of the articles I wanted to read laterthere was never really a way to save them all in one easily accessible place, and it drove me insane. Email was clumsy, bookmarks never synced correctly, and neither of those solutions could be taken offline. Pocket essentially solved the question: Now, what was that article again? At the risk of sounding way too smitten with an app, Pocket has even changed my commute homeafter work, I open up the app on my phone and voil! All of the articles Ive saved over the course of the day are ready for my long offline commute home. And if I want to pick up reading on my laptop when I get home, I can do that. Technology is magic!

Slate,L,Orion launch: Watch live.,"Update, Dec. 4, 2014, at 14:50 UTC: After a morning fraught with problems, the Orion launch was scrubbed for today and will be attempted at the same time tomorrow: 12:05 UTC (07:05 Eastern time) Friday, Dec. 5. The first problem was a boat in the red zone in the waters off the Cape, and after that was cleared the winds picked up, violating limits. The countdown resumed several times, but then a problem with fuel valves in the tanks held things up. Cycling the valves (essentailly turning them on and off again five times) cleared the problem for the liquid oxygen tanks, but not the liquid hydrogen tanks. The problem took too long to solve and the timer ran up against the end of the launch window, so the attempt was scrubbed.

NASA's Orion test capsule is scheduled to launch on a powerful Delta IV Heavy rocket at 12:05 UTC (07:05 Eastern) today. That's 5:05 in the morning for me in Colorado, so I figure there's a chance I may not wake up in time to see it. Just in case, I'm posting this article early and embedding NASA's UStream channel here so y'all have a comfortable place to kick back and watch for yourself. You can try NASA TV as well.

The launch window is more than two hours long, so even if it doesn't launch on time it may still go up today. The mission itself (rounding the Earth twice and then splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California) is four and a half hours long, so there's plenty of time to catch it.


As I hear more (and get some coffee in me), I'll update this post.

Slate,L,New No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA from Google is much easier for humans.,"Interpreting the textual Rorschach test known as CAPTCHA is a time-honored tradition for Internet users. For years, we have cocked our heads like confused parrots, puzzling over the skewed letter-number combinations. Back in 2012, Slate predicted the death of the much-reviled authentication technology. Software companies created artificial intelligence capable of breaking it. Its days seemed to be numbered. But like a resilient phoenix, CAPTCHA has risen again. And this time it isnt so bad.

On Wednesday, Googles Online Security Blog announced an upgrade to the old CAPTCHA. Called No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA, the new technology uses an Advanced Risk Analysis backend that monitors user engagement before, during, and after the CAPTCHA process. (reCAPTCHA is simply a version of the original software application in which user input helped computer programs to digitize books.) Nonmobile users simply click a box that reads Im not a robot, and the new API does its thing. (Somewhere, a spam-bot is crying digital tears.) Google doesnt go into the nitty-gritty of how the risk analysis tools work, but it seems pretty confident about the new approach.


    Advertisement




To rescue mobile users from fumbling around with phone keyboards, Google developed something reminiscent of childhood matching games. Users will be given an image and asked to match it to a series of different images. For example, you may see a rubber duck. Underneath it youll see five photos of rubber ducks, and four photos of former Vice President Dan Quayle. Simply tap on the ducks, and youre done. (Googles blog used turkeys and kittens to illustrate this.) Fun! Once youve finished and clean up, you can have butter cookies and apple juice.


But user beware: The old CAPTCHA isnt yet dead. If the new version cannot determine whether the user is human, its back to the jumbled text you know and love. It seems as long as spam-bots roam the Internet, we will have to keep proving our humanity.


Google explains the new process more in the video below.

Slate,L,U.S. Department of Education comes out in support of transgender students' rights.,"On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education released a long-awaited, much-needed guidance document for elementary and secondary schools that offer or want to offer single-sex classes.

Included within the document was an important protection for transgender students that should not be overlooked. The guidance states clearly that transgender students must be allowed to participate in single-sex classes consistent with their gender identity. (In other words, consistent with who they are.) This latest positive breakthrough builds on guidance released earlier this year that made it explicitly clear, for the first time, that Title IX extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity.


    Advertisement




The need for this clarifying direction to schools across the country could not have been clearer.


As the ACLU has repeatedly documented, and fought, far too many single-sex programs are based on discredited science that is rooted in outdated and harmful gender stereotypes. For example, teachers have been instructed that girls should not have time limits on tests because, unlike boys, girls' brains cannot function well under these conditions. On the flip side, teachers have been told to firmly discipline boys who like to read, do not enjoy contact sports, and do not have a lot of close male friends by requiring them to spend time with normal males and to play sports.


These kinds of sweeping generalizations are especially harmful to students who do not conform to rigid gender stereotypes, including LGBTQ students. Indeed, such generalizations and stereotypes are precisely the sort of discrimination that Title IX was intended to eliminate more than four decades ago, and they should have no place in our public education system today. The guidance released on Monday is clear that schools cannot rely on these kinds of harmful stereotypes.


These recent actions from the Department of Education are important steps forward, but there is still more to do. The Department of Education should release comprehensive guidance for schools nationwide explaining how Title IX protects transgender and gender nonconforming students from discrimination and what steps schools need to take to be in compliance with the law and meet their obligations to these students.


All students deserve the opportunity to attend school free from discrimination because of who they are, including stereotypes about how normal boys and girls learn.

Slate,L,"Derrick Rose, injuries: NBA stars aren't superheroes. They break just like the rest of us puny humans.","When the Cleveland Cavaliers open their season at home on Thursday night, fans will once again gaze upon a 10-story-tall, Nike-sponsored banner of Akrons favorite son, LeBron James. The new LeBronvertisement will hang in the same spot that James iconic We Are All Witnesses billboard fluttered until a certain ill-fated television special in 2010, and its presence will suggest a righted universe. Basketballs greatest living practitioner is back where he belongs, looming godlike over his adoring city. It will be a welcome sight for both Cleveland and the NBA itself, a league whose players have recently been dropping likewell, if not flies, at least mortal beings.

This Tuesday, the NBAs opening night began with rising star Anthony Davis blocking nine shots and ended with rookie Julius Randle getting carried off the court with a broken leg. The sequence of events felt like a microcosm of NBA life: intoxicating promise chased by harsh reality, supermen unburdened by gravity until theyre collapsed in pain on the floor.


In any sports league, the dawn of a new season is typically a time for hope, when every fan outside of the greater Philadelphia area believes his favorite team could be a contender if everything breaks right. This year, though, a lot broke wrong before the season began. When Indianas All-Star small forward Paul George fractured his tibia during a Team USA scrimmage in August, the immediate (and probably correct) consensus was that his gruesome injury would kill the upcoming season of a Pacers team just a few months removed from the Eastern Conference Finals. Oklahoma City forward and reigning MVP Kevin Durant is now indefinitely scooter-bound and set to miss the first part of the season with a broken foot. Unlike the Pacers, no one expects Durants Thunder to suffer too much in his absence, as the team boasts a second superstar in point guard Russell Westbrookalbeit a superstar whos had three knee surgeries himself over the past two years, and just last season missed 36 games.


    Advertisement




The NBA and its corporate partners have long encouraged fantasies of the leagues stars as superhuman. Michael Jordan went to space. Charles Barkley posted up Godzilla. Superhero capes have passed from Shaquille ONeal to Dwight Howard to Blake Griffin. But more and more, such imagery invites cognitive dissonance. Its not just George, Durant, and Westbrook whove crashed to Earth. Adidas Derrick Rose bullfighting spot from 2012 already feels hopelessly dated in light of the Bulls stars knee troubles, and watching the oft-hobbled Dwyane Wade in a 2010, Iron Man-inspired Nike commercial is either cringe-inducing or laughter-inducing, depending on your allegiances.


Its tempting to see Rose as the exemplar of the fickleness of NBA life. Point guard is the premier position in todays NBA, and every team salivates over finding the next otherworldly athlete to man the position. Rose is, or was, at the vanguard of this movement, a breathtaking mix of explosiveness and controlled power who became the youngest MVP in league history just three years ago. Two major injuries later, its hard not to wonder if all this leaping of tall buildings broke him down in ways we couldnt see. Maybe the reason that 99.9 percent of human bodies cant do things like this is that human bodies arent really supposed to. In Wright Thompsons recent ESPN the Magazine profile, Rose comes across as nothing if not fragilephysically, psychically, emotionally.


But anyone looking for the starkest illustration of the precariousness of the leagues health, in every sense, should look to Clevelands literal poster child, LeBron James himself. For 12 seasons, King James has been the NBAs crowning asset, a player whose immense gifts have made him its most potent fantasy object since Michael Jordan. The most games James has ever missed in a season is seven. Hes missed only 44 in his whole careerjust 11 more than the Pelicans Davis, who is a mere 21 years old.


The more distressing side of this is that James has played more minutes than anyone in basketball since the 201011 season, with the pre-scooter Durant a close second. As ESPN.coms Tom Haberstroh noted last April, Over the past three and a half years, James and Durant have essentially crammed in an extra NBA season compared to the rest of the league. And that was written before LeBron led the Miami Heat to their fourth consecutive trip to the finals. The center cannot hold, as someone once said, and they werent talking about the Cavs notoriously gimpy pivotman Anderson Varejao. If LeBron ends up rolling around Cleveland on a scooter, that would be very bad for the Cavs, the NBA, basketball fans, and everyone else who doesnt own stock in the company that manufactured said scooter.


Superstar injuries in the NBA are nothing newMagic, Bird, and Jordan each missed long stretches either during or near their respective primesand its hard to say if basketball is a more dangerous sport now than in generations past. In the post-lockout years of 2012 and 2013 there appeared to be a discernible spike in ACL tears, which felled stars such as Rose, the Celtics Rajon Rondo, and the Timberwolves Ricky Rubio, as well as role players like Iman Shumpert and Lou Williams. This trend has since been refuted, even as other knee injuries have recently hampered Westbrook (torn meniscus), Kobe Bryant (lateral tibial plateau fracture), and Rose yet again (torn mensicus).


But in an era of fantasy leagues, up-to-the-minute smartphone notifications, and Byzantine salary cap rules, injuries loom over the league and its fans as never before. Players and coaches are acutely aware of this. In recent weeks, the Mavericks Dirk Nowitzki, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, and LeBron James himself have publicly advocated for a shortened season. Michael Jordan, as youd expect, offered up a kids today rebuttal from the owners box, remarking, If I wasn't playing 82 games, I still would've been playing somewhere else because that's the love for the game I had. (Jordans former minor-league baseball teammates could not be reached for comment.)


The NBA, eager to protect its stars but loath to sacrifice the box-office rewards of an 82-game schedule, recently experimented with a 44-minute preseason game, which clocked in at a brisk two hours. But such flirtations are half-hearted Band-Aids. The grind of the league is less about a few extra minutes per night than it is about games played on back-to-back nights, overnight flights, and interminable winter road trips. And whos to say a 44-minute game would actually cut into a superstars minutes total? Last years leader in time served, Carmelo Anthony, played 38.7 minutes per game. Even with a shortened game clock, why would the Knicks Derek Fisher, a first-year coach of a bad team in a brutal media market, have any incentive to play him less?


Luckily for him and everyone who loves watches him play, LeBron may have been granted a reprieve from this grueling cycle. David Blatt, the Cavs first-year coach, has suggested that LeBron might see his minutes curtailed this season. Cleveland fans should hope that he follows through on that strategy. Nobodys going to hang a 10-story banner of LeBron James sitting on the bench. But for James to stay in full flight for as long as possible, hell need to stay grounded for long enough that the rigors of pro basketball dont grind him down.

Slate,L,Terminator: Genisys trailer: Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in the franchise reboot (VIDEO).,"Following 2009s loud and dull Terminator: Salvation, the franchise will get a reboot of sorts with next years Terminator: Genisys. Though after seeing the first trailer, Im more inclined to call it a remix than a reboot.

It starts off with a familiar storyline: John Connor (Jason Clarke), several years in the future, has tasked lieutenant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) with the mission of going back to 1984 and saving his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke, aka Daenerys Targaryen), from the Terminator sent to kill her to prevent Johns crucial leadership in the rebellion. When Kyle arrives, Sarah repeats the franchises classic catchphrase, Come with me if you wanna live. So far, this feels like a fairly straightforward recreation of The Terminator.








    Advertisement




But then Sarah informs Kyle that we have already destroyed the T-800 thats after herthe we being her and Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing a future version of the T-800, who has blown his younger self to smithereens. After that, things get weird: Sarah explains to Kyle that everythings changed and that, in some strange alternate course of events, theyve figured out a way to stop Judgment Day from happening. Theres even a brief scene that suggests Sarah was taken under the Terminators wing as a child.


So are we supposed to disregard the previous films in the franchise before seeing this latest edition, or watch them all over again so we can tell what in the world is going on? Hopefully, things become a bit clearer when Terminator: Genisys opens July 1, 2015.

Slate,L,Cosby lawsuit claims extortion by Judy Huth.,"Bill Cosby has been largely silent over the past several weeks as the sexual assault allegations against the comedian continued to pile up. While Cosby, through his lawyer, has generally dismissed the claims as false through his lawyer Marty Singer, on Thursday Cosbys legal team pushed back on the recent accusation leveled by Judy Huth. In a court filing this week, Huth said she was sexually abused by Cosby at the Playboy Mansion in 1974, when she was only 15 years old.

Cosby attorney Marty Singer accused Huth of extortion in a court filing on Thursday. Cosby says Huth's lawyer approached the comedian's attorney, Marty Singer, last month and made ominous references to 'criminal penalties.  ABC News reports. According to the lawsuit, Huth's lawyer demanded $100,000 for her silence, and later increased the amount to $250,000 as additional women came forward.


    Advertisement




Judy Huth is the first woman to file a lawsuit against the comedian in the latest round of accusations. The nearly two dozen other claims against Cosby are decades-old and have exceeded the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes. Huth, however, who was underage at the time, used a portion of California law that allows for a lawsuit to be filed three years after a child sex crime is discovered to have caused damages, according to Reuters.


While Cosby has so far avoided any legal repercussions for the alleged assaults, his silence on the mounting allegations has decimated his public image. Upcoming projects with NBC and Netflix have been canceled, Cosby has resigned from the board of Temple University, and on Thursday, the Navy revoked an honorary title from Cosby as a consequence of the allegations. Cosby served four years in the Navy and in 2011, was given the title of honorary Chief Petty Officer.

Slate,L,Darren Wilson no true bill: Why cops are almost never indicted for shooting someone in the line of duty.,"A St. Louis County grand jury spent more than three months hearing evidence about the shooting death of Michael Brown.

That result would have been exceedingly rare if Wilson were a regular citizen. Because he was a cop the outcome was close to inevitable.

Slate,L,Science shows you're better off being a nice boss.,"This article originally appeared in Inc.

In Hebrew, there's a concept called ""distance"" that refers to keeping a distance between a subordinate and the person in charge. So, for example, a lieutenant in the army treats his soldiers with ""distance,"" refraining from getting too friendly with them.


    Advertisement




That concept often carries over into the business world, with bosses assuming that they need to keep a sense of distance from their employees in order to maintain a hierarchy at the company that fostersrespect and hard work. You don't want your employees to forget who's in charge, and you don't want to seem too soft.


But asStanford University'sEmma Sepplpoints out in the Harvard Business Review, this probably isn't the best way to approach leadership.For one, being a tough, distant leader often adds stress to your employees, which is proven to harm your employees' health and increase the likelihood of them quitting. A report fromBMC Public Healthshows that health care expenditures were 46 percent greater for employees with high levels of stress.Another studyshows howoccupational stress leads to employee turnover.


On the other hand, research shows that being anice bosscan be incredibly beneficial for both employees and a business.A study from theUniversity of Kent at Canterburyfinds that being altruistic can actually increase your status in a group. Other research fromHarvard Business School's Amy Cuddyexplains that leaders who project warmth earn their employees' trust and as a result aremore effective than tough leaders. Then there'sanother studythat shows that a leader's good attitude can spread to his or her team and cause them to be more civil and productive.


Seppl points to additional studies thatshow other benefits of being a kind leader: Employees will feel more loyal and committed, will be more likely to help their co-workers, will treat customers better, will be less stressed overall, andwill even have better health.


""A good boss may literally be good for the heart,"" writesSeppl,the associate director of Stanford's Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education.


Now thatthe importance of being anice bosshas been established, it's important to recognize what that actually means. It might translate into offering perks to your employees, like being able to work from home or extra vacation time. But it also means that you simply have to treat employees with respect and kindness and show a true commitment to values, ethics, and self-sacrifice.

As a result, most conversations below Slate articles are small. Slate has published more than 12,000 pieces since the beginning of 2014. Only 12 percent of those pieces attracted participation from more than 100 individual commenters. In comparison, the average Slate article attracts many thousands of readersor at least clickers.





Yes, often the comment icon at the top of an article displays a number greater than 100. But thats a measure of comments, not unique commenters; the icons count may double, triple, or infinity count those commenters who have much to say. Thats true of one of Slates most-commented pieces of 2014, The Rise of the Ironic Man-Hater by Amanda Hess; it garnered about 4,900 comments from only 343 commenters, meaning the average commenter left about 14 comments below the article.





Slate articles almost never engage more than 1 percent of their readers as commenters. Its a small crowd, but that doesnt seem unusual. Across many types of websites, its often observed that there are many more people consuming content than creating it. Some people have referred to this a 1 percent rule of Internet participation.


So the odds are against you. You will probably not comment on this piece.

Dear Prudence,
My husband is all the usual things: Smart! Funny! Caring! He has, however, turned into a horrible gift giver. He used to be quite creative, but our lives have become busier as weve become older. We have a child, a house, and more demanding careers. Im not looking for extravagant gifts, Im just looking for a little consideration and I know he has it in him. For the price of the half-dead grocery store flowers I received on our recent anniversary, I would have loved to have been taken out to my favorite bar for a drink. This wouldnt be a big problem, except for the fact that we are hosting the holidays this year. My entire family will be with us on Christmas morning. Im still smarting from the flowers, and Im afraid if I open another so-so gift Ill cry! We are a really close family and theyll be able to read my face no matter how hard I try to keep it in check. We also are the kind of family that opens each present painfully slowly and ohh and ahh over every one. Should I bring this up with my spouse, and how do I not sound shallow?

No Poker Face


Dear Poker,
Your husband is not all the usual things. From my inbox the usual things are Addicted to Porn! Chronically Unemployed! Volatile Temper! So your husband is a gem, one who remembered your anniversary. My husband is a gem too, and when he surprised me with the last bouquet of half-dead subway flowers for Valentines Day, I was thrilled. Its true Im insensitive and not a gift person, but I understand that other people are gift persons. I even know about The 5 Love Languages and that receiving gifts is one of them. Of course, if I were married to such a love-language person, that would make me want to cite another love language, words of affirmation, and say to you, Stop being such a pain about gifts. There seems to be two issues here: One is that you want thoughtful gifts from your husband, the other is that you expect him to read your mind. So speak up. If you wanted to go to your favorite bar for you anniversary, in advance of it you should have told him and arranged for a babysitter. You have an opportunity this Christmas to tell him what you want. You can even hand him a catalog with an item circled in pen, or show him the website where he can order the leather tote youve been desiring. Then, when your family indulges in its fetishistic gift opening practices, you will not have to worry about your chin quivering like Claire Danes on Homeland.


Prudie








Dear Prudence,
Our 3-year-old son was diagnosed with a terminal, incurable, degenerative disease several months ago. The doctors told us he has a very limited amount of good time left. My husband and I were fortunate enough to be able to take several months of leave from our jobs to spend time with him and take fun trips. Family even moved back to the area to be around him more. Our community has been wonderful and supportive. The issue is my 16-year-old stepdaughter. She lives three hours away and is only here once a month at best, less than her court-mandated visitation. She loves her brother but she has told us that she doesnt want to get closer to him because it will hurt more when he dies. My husband has talked to her about how there will be time for dealing with the pain later,about the importance of building memories, and how she will likely regret this, but it hasnt helped. We try to get her here for major events, but it takes a lot of stressful coordination with her mother who always acts as if she is doing a favor to let her come. Theres a family party before Christmas, but shes not coming. We were told she will only be here for a few days after Christmas. Our therapist told us to let her know aboutwhat we have plannedbut thatwe cant force her to come. My husband and I are both very hurt and sad that her brother, who probably will never get to know another sibling, is deprived of time with her. What can we do?


A Worried Mom


Dear Worried,
I am so sorry for your heartbreak. In terrible circumstances like these, sometimes it helps to deflect your pain onto something else, to help turn away from whats coming. So while your complaint is legitimate, it may even be a relief to be able to brood over the behavior of a teenager and her cold mother. Its good to hear you have a therapist and she sounds like a wise one. Youre doing all you can dotelling this girl that you would like her to come, and then leaving it up to her. There is no creature on earth more self-involved than a 16-year-old. But even the most selfless one would have a hard time facing the impending death of a little brother and absorbing the anguish of the adults who love him. Sure, if your stepdaughter were different, she would be doing everything possible to spend every moment with a brother she loves and knows shes going to lose. Maybe someday, when shes less under the influence of her mother, she will reflect and feel a deep sense of remorse over what she didnt do. But worrying about that is not something you should be wasting your emotional energy on. I would urge you to let this go, but if occasionally venting about this with your husband takes your mind off other things, then allow yourself that small indulgence. But as you do so, be careful not to make this frustrating girl the focus of your pain.


Prudie




Dear Prudence,
About six months ago, I got hired at an amazing company and couldnt have been happier about leaving my old job and its craziness behind. I love the atmosphere and people at my new job but theres one little problem. In my cubicle area, which I share with three people, I am surrounded by extremely loud eaters. One of my co-workers slurps his coffee so loudly I assume other people around us can hear but just dont say anything. The other two co-workers chomp on sandwiches or gobble up pasta and other assorted foods so loudly that sometimes I have to get up from my desk and pretend to need to use the restroom. Am I the problem, am I just too sensitive to peoples eating habits? Or is there a way I can ask them to quiet down without becoming the uptight new girl?


Stop Chewing


Dear Stop,
Have I got a diagnosis for you! (I keep promising I will stop practicing medicine on the Internet, but I just found out about this disorder, and I cant help myself.) Read this article on misphonia, a newly identified condition in which people are driven bonkers by selective sounds, usually produced by specific people. So your spouses chewing drives you insane or your co-workers pen clicking fills you with homicidal rage. Its possible fate has dropped you in a pod of people lacking in cubicle manners, but hitting three out of three seems unlikely. With that and the description of the Dolby-quality pasta chewing, Im suspicious the issue is you. You are the new girl who made a timely escape from a miserable job. If you want to keep things happy, you will not tell the people near you that when they eat and drinkanything!you have run to the bathroom to keep from screaming. The article says that noise-canceling headphones might help, or maybe you can occasionally turn on a soft white-noise machine. Perhaps learning meditation will help you live with the fact that you work at an office where everyones lunch is lip-smacking good.


Prudie


Dear Prudence,
My husband and I have a happy marriage of more than a decade, two kids, two cats, and a lovely home. We have a large extended family we enjoy bringing together for holidays and celebrations. The problem is my father-in-law and his wife. They are wealthy people with several homes and we rarely see them except for the holidays. When they come to our house they bring their German shepherd dogs, which they leave in their car with the windows slightly open.Over Thanksgiving anyone walking by the car, including our guests, was greeted by the dogs barking aggressively and shaking the car. On the rare occasion that we have been invited to one of their homes, the dogs have gotten aggressive with the children. My niece was bitten on her thigh, and my then 5-year-old son was barked into a creek by one of the dogs, and I had to rescue him. No one seemed to care. Weve invited the in-laws to our home for Christmas to avoid any confrontation with the dogs. But now they bring the dogs with them! My husband hands me a cocktail and tells me to ignore them. We have argued about it, and my husband says I dont want him to have a relationship with his father. Of course I do or I wouldnt put up with their nonsense for all these years!Icant drink away their visits. I want to insist that they dont bring the dogs. Any suggestions?


Dog Gone


Dear Gone,
The members of your in-laws pack sound rather like the three-headed Fluffy, Hagrids vicious hellhound from Harry Potter. An enchanted harp put all three of Fluffys heads to sleep, so you might want to start learning how to make celestial music as Christmas draws closer. You have two children and two cats, and when the holidays are over, youre within your rights to expect you end up with the same number you started with, all 16 limbs included. Avoiding free-range encounters with these poorly disciplined dogs is a smart move. But its one thing to stop them at your own door, and another to say they cant even be incarcerated in the car while the rest of you eat. Sure, its crazy that these wealthy people cant manage to find dog sitters, but from your description they are a parody of spoiled obliviousness. (I acknowledge that relatives who are not among the 1 percent are also known to make obnoxious demands about their pets, especially over the holidays.) If they want their luxury car shredded, it really doesnt make any difference to your festivities if the dogs are held hostage in it. The holidays are a rare time of connection for your husband and your kids with these relatives. So I agree with your husband that you should have a heavy hand with the brandy when spiking the eggnog. But dont have so much that you get tipsy enough to invite the dogs in for some scraps.

Slate,L,Netizen Report: Iranian Facebook user sentenced to death for allegedly insulting the prophet.,"The Netizen Report originally appears each week on Global Voices Advocacy. Mahsa Alimardani, Ellery Roberts Biddle, Lisa Ferguson, Hae-in Lim, and Sarah Myers West contributed to this report.


 


 

Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world. This weeks report begins in Iran, where on Nov. 24 the Supreme Court upheld a ruling sentencing Facebook user Soheil Arabi to death by hanging. Arabi was tried over a series of posts on his Facebook page deemed insulting to the Prophet Muhammad.


    Advertisement




The 30-year-old was arrested in November 2013, along with his wife. While she was soon released, Arabi has been kept behind bars, where he has endured numerous interrogations, psychological pressure, and long periods of solitary confinement. According to his wife, he was allowed access to a lawyer only immediately prior to his trial. Prosecutors rejected Arabis claims that many of the posts in question were written by his contacts and merely appeared on his wall because he had commented on them. Leading international human rights organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are urging authorities not to execute Arabi and to re-evaluate the laws under which he was sentenced.



Despite media reports suggesting a new, more moderate approach to governance in the country under President Hassan Rouhani, this and other recent events indicate that security and intelligence agents in Iran are taking increasingly repressive measures against dissent and political expression online.

Slate,L,Drinking problem in academia: Alcohol abuse among faculty members.,"This week the Chronicle of Higher Education is running a series of long-form investigations about drinking culture on American campuses. Im as concerned about the overdoses, assaults, and general idiocy of liquored-up undergrads as anyoneperhaps even more so, given the time one of my old Ohio State students, a 90-pound junior, proudly declared her intention to down 21 shots on the upcoming birthday that made it legal to do so. When I mentioned that this could result in her actual death, she just rolled her eyes like I was a neurotic off-duty German shepherd police dog: Oh, isnt that cute; the Old thinks its people and it knows something.

Make sure to also check out Are Comments Sections Worth It?, a Slate Plus debate featuring writers Amanda Hess, Rachael Larimore, Amanda Marcotte, and Will Oremus, and You Will Not Comment on This Article.

At Slates annual retreat in September, Editor-in-Chief Julia Turner polled a packed room of staffers about the state of commenting on Slate. When she asked who wouldnt mind if Slate eliminated the comments section entirely, about half the writers in the room raised their hands.


The media seems to be in a moment of commenting skepticism. See Popular Science, which removed commenting from its site in late 2013. Or Reuters and Re/code, a popular technology site, which both followed suit this November. Other sites no longer allow anonymous commenting, often requiring commenters to login via Facebook. Many Slate writers agree with these moves. They feel that commenting is broken, and theyre looking for change.

Slate,L,Dear Prudence: I was fat-shamed by my cousin at Thanksgiving.,"Emily Yoffe, aka Dear Prudence, is online weekly to chat live with readers. An edited transcript of the chat is below. (Sign up here to get Dear Prudence delivered to your inbox each week. Read Prudies Slate columns here. Send questions to Prudence at prudence@slate.com.)

Emily Yoffe: Good afternoon. I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! Props to my 95-year-old mother-in-law for another great meal. Love that Thanksgiving sauerkraut!


Q. Her Weight Problem, Not Mine: Over Thanksgiving, I volunteered to host my relatives. This included my cousin who used to be a plus-sized woman, had gastric bypass five years ago, and now believes in fat shaming. She targets me especially because of the fact I am a plus-sized woman too, but love my body. During Thanksgiving, she talked about my weight to anyone that would listen, even after I told her to stop it. I am ashamed to say that after she made a reference to my black swimsuit as a Shamu suit, my temper got the better of me, and I grabbed some mashed potatoes with my hands and started throwing them at her, screaming that she was a hateful, horrible person and then tossed her out of my house.


    Advertisement




Now that the dust has settled, my family feels I owe HER an apology and an invitation to spend Christmas with me! Please help me get them off my back already!


A: Now Im kind of sad that my familys Thanksgiving was so civilized that no one got a bowl of sauerkraut and dumped it on anyones head. I can totally understand how instead of passing the potatoes you decided to toss the potatoes at her. Your cousin is a despicable person. What you have to do with such people when youre forced to share space with them is walk away. I understand you were highly provoked, but you should have kept in mind that in her attempts to fat shame you, she was actually shaming herself. Unfortunately, you made it physical. So be the better person, and apologize for losing it. But as for Christmas, unless in response to you she gives you a full-bodied apology in which she explains she now sees how cruel and insulting she has been, I dont see any reason for you to invite someone to your home who rejoices in making you miserable.








Q. Panty-Wearing Man: A widower for some five years, I enjoy wearing womens lingerie: panties, camisoles, nighties, the occasional bra. I do not wear dresses, apply makeup, or try to pass in any way. I just enjoy the sensuality of the clothes. A widow and I have been sharing company and if Im reading the signs correctly, are heading toward intimacy. My late wife was fine with my undies choice; how do I inform my friend that she might not be the only one shopping at Victorias Secret? Were each in our early 60s. Thanks!


A: Before you get intimate, binge-watch with your friend the Amazon series, Transparent. Its an exquisitely written and acted (and very funny) series about the coming out as transgender of a middle-aged father of three grown children. I know thats not your situation. But there are many scenes that will absolutely hit home for you, and it will be a great way to open the discussion you want to have with your new lady. I advise people with kinks to disclose them early to new loves. Its simply unfair months into a relationship to have an, Oh, by the way, theres something I should have told you  discussion. It also sounds as if this isnt an occasional thing for you, but an essential thing. You need to be prepared that this might be a shocking or difficult revelation for her, but what matters is what she then does with the information. And even if it turns out shes not as open-minded as your late wife, I assure you, youll be glad you watched the series.


Q. My Son Calls My Husband Daddy: My 3-year-old has very little contact with his father, who lives 700 miles away. I recently married a wonderful man, whom I love dearly and who takes care of both me and my son. My son has recently taken to calling my husband Daddy every now and then. Should I try to discourage this or encourage it? My sons father sees him about once a year, and calls about twice a year. My son usually calls him by his first name. My husband likes being called Daddy and, honestly, I like it, too. What do we do here?


A: Yay for Daddy! What a wonderful gift your marriage has turned out to be for your son. He now has a true father in his life, one who embraces this boy and wants to be his real father. Your son has already told you how he feels, and you all agree with it. So please, encourage him to call his stepfather Daddy. His biological father is a nonentity, so he can make his annual appearance, and your son can say, Hey, Willy, how you doing? I have had so many wonderful letters over the years from people who celebrate the stepparents who came into their lives and truly stepped up. How wonderful your husband is joining this crew.


Q. Vacationing Dad: My retired parents had scheduled a trip to Spain, but my mother became violently nauseated and feverish on the way to the airport. My father mistakenly believed that his trip insurance would only cover my mother, so he called my brother to pick her up and take her to the hospital, while he went on the trip alone. She was very sick and in the hospital for three days, but it turned out to be a non-life-threatening virus of some sort. I was furious with my father, but my mother is not, and my brothers feel that it was just Dad being Dad. Is this shockingly bad behavior, or is this sort of thing socially acceptable?


A: Umm, are you sure prior to the trip your father didnt encourage some ailing toddler to give your mother a big wet one? Im having a hard time imagining this scene at the airport where your brother carts away your desperately ill mother, while your father waves adios. Yes, this is shocking behavior, but you really dont have standing to do anything about it. Since everyone writes this off as Dad being Dad, maybe your mother enjoyed the pampering she received during her hospital stay more than she would have enjoyed being in Spain with her oblivious spouse. Everyone has shrugged this off but you. But Dads home, Moms out of the hospital, and about the only suggestion you can make is that next time your parents take a trip that they both read the fine print on any travel insurance.




Q. Re: Panty-Wearing Man: The letter writer makes it very clear that he isnt trans. The fact that you call it a kink shows that on some level you understand this. Equating a kink with being transgender is very offensive.


A: I explicitly said I understood that being trans was not the letter writers situation. Then I said that there would be scenes in the show that spoke specifically to the conversation he wants to have. If you think that being transgender is offensive, I dont share your view.


Q. Boy in Pink: My 5-year-old sons favorite color is pink and he wants to incorporate pink anywhere he can. On days he has dance class he often wears pink leggings and he likes to paint his nails pink. At school there are no issues, his classmates and teachers embrace it, but weve had some concerns with family and in public. To other kids and family when something is said he tells them that boy and girl things dont exist and people can like whatever they want. How do I respond to family and his dad when they tell me I overindulge him by buying him pink shoes and painting his nails? Do I correct strangers in public that assume hes a girl because hes wearing pink leggings or let it go? I want my boy to know that hes loved and supported no matter what.


A: I love your son! What an amazingly wise and confident little guy you have. How wonderful that you say his classmates and teachers are all onboard with the boy in pink. The world really is changing! Strangers are irrelevant. It sounds as if your son has a handle on the fact that some people incorrectly think people think pink is only for girls, and this doesnt bother him. But what is concerning is how bothered your husband is. He is absolutely entitled to feel unease, but having recognized that, he has to examine these feelings and then figure out whats best for your son. None of you know that this pink phase means. But whats important is letting your son feel supported in his choices. This seems like a good issue for you and your husband to discuss on a short-term basis with a counselor. Your husband can air his concerns and figure out what to do about them, so that your boy feels both his parents have his back.


Q. Re: Daddy: My 5-year-old stepdaughter has a wonderful mother, with whom she lives during the school year. I came into her life when she was just turning 3, and by the end of our first week together, she started calling me Mommy. Now older, she calls me by my first name around her mom, but when in our home in our routine, she calls me Mommy. She once confided in me that her mom did not want her to call me Mommy. I told her that I didnt want her to get in trouble with her mom, but that in our house, she could call me whatever she was most comfortable with. I always felt that I didnt want her to think that I loved her less than my own children. If your husband is the only father figure he is close to, I think you should just let your son take the lead and go with it.


A: Beautiful, thank you.


Q. Re: Shamu Suit Cousin: I understand that at the point someone is throwing mashed potatoes, theyve literally lost it. That being said, some people deserve a face full of mashed potatoes, and quite frankly, I dont think your letter writer should have to apologize. In fact, I think she should evaluate why on earth she has people in her life who want her to invite her hateful cousin back into her home? Why isnt she getting more familial support?


A: Good point about the rest of the family. Whats going on there? Maybe its time to spend Christmas with friends. As I said, I understand the face full of potatoes, but its better for the letter writer to acknowledge she shouldnt have done it, no matter how awful the provocation. That allows her better to move forward and explain she is not going to allow such a toxic person in her home.


Q. Re:Boy in Pink: Dad may want to check out James Bralys excellent story from The Moth called Olivers Pink Bicycleits a wonderful story of a parents acceptance of his sons obsession with pink.


A: Thanks!


Q. Am I Responsible for a Parent I Barely Remember?: When I was 3 years old, my funny, intelligent, handsome father developed paranoid schizophrenia, including very disturbing hallucinations that made him act erratically. My mother feared for her life and mine and divorced him and moved us halfway across the countryhe wouldnt stay on his meds and she felt she didnt have a choice. He maintained contact with me as well as he could. After his parents passed away, we lost touch. I assumed that his brother and sister knew where he was and what his condition was. Now I find that they havent heard from him in 10 years. Im an adult now with a family of my own, and I find myself increasingly worried and wondering about his wellbeing. Do I try to track him down? I know the mentally ill arent more likely to be dangerous than others, but Im still worried that, even at 65, he may be off his meds and unpredictable. Is it fair to my kids to pursue this?


A: What a tragic story, and how broken our mental health system is. You can start by gathering some information about your father without contacting him. A private investigator should be able to put together a basic dossier on him. At this point, you dont even know if hes alive, so first establish that. If he is, then see if hes employed, or has been arrested, etc. The information will allow you to make a better decision about whether you want to proceed and how.

Slate,L,"Marcel Lelinhof photographs the Hells Angels in Norway in his book, Helvetes EnglerHells Angels MC Norway(PHOTOS).","The Hells Angels may have loomed large in 1960s American culture, but theyre alive and well in Norway.

Theres more than one stereotype shattered inMarcel Lelinhofs book Helvetes EnglerHells Angels MC Norway: Besides being Norwegian and existing in the 21stcentury, the motorcycle gangs Lelinhof photographed for five years had none of the law-breaking, violent tendencies of the group described in Hunter S. Thompsons 1966 bookHell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga.


The first Norwegian chapter of the Hells Angels started in 1992 and was probably as wild as their U.S. brothers then. But the club as it is now is not what I expected after reading Thompson,Lelinhof said via email. It is a tight-knit brotherhood of guys who have known each other for a long time and who have sacrificed much to become who they are.

Norway is a small country of about 5 million people, but it has nine chapters of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and more than 100 members total. But before Lelinhof could start his project, he needed approval from Hells Angels Europe and Hells Angels MC World, a process that took three years. Even after that, gaining the trust of individuals within the local organizations took time.


I have stayed at all the clubhouses in Norway. This is the only way to make a project like this work. You have to earn peoples trust, and the only way to really understand others and to tell a truthful story is to get to know them over time, he said.


As in the United States, biker gangs in Norway have a history of behavior that contributed to a criminal reputation: In 1997, for example,the Great Nordic Biker Warreached the country when a car bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the Bandidos, the Angels rival club, killing a bystander. But the Hells Angels MC Norway Lelinhof traveled with is not a club of boy scouts, nor it is a club with a bunch of rabid lunatics withguns in one hand and drugs in the other.

Lelinhof, a former self-described punk, has photographed other subcultures in the past, including skinheads and rockabillies. He said doing so has spurred his creativity, and satisfied his urge to explore the darker side of life, which is why he continues to travel and party with the Angels to this day.


I feel that subcultures are important and bold creative forces in Western societybefore they are consumed by commercial interests, he said. These groups of people are willing to live on the edge of society and are made up by individuals that challenge what the mainstream considers to be interesting or acceptable. As a result, they make for great stories to tell.

Slate,L,M83: New composite shows incredible detail.,"M83 is a lovely spiral galaxy located about 15 million light-years from Earth. Its the 83rd entry in Charles Messiers catalog of bright objects in the sky (originally created by the comet-hunting astronomer in the late 1700s to keep track of objects he might mistake for his quarry), and one of the few big spirals Ive never seen for myself through my telescope.

Ill have to fix that sometime. Of course, my view will never, ever be quite as nice as this one:

Holy. Wow.


That image is a combination from two different observatories; part Hubble, part Subaru (an 8-meter monster telescope in Hawaii). It was created by master astrophotographer Robert Gendler. The inner parts are from Hubble, and parts of the surrounding area (added to fill in blank spots) are from Subaru.


If you have a good eye you can tell; the resolution in the spiral arms is quite high, and you can see individual stars, but if you look at the two more distant background galaxies on the left, the details look a bit fuzzier. Subaru has good resolution, but its hard to beat Hubble.


I highly recommend checking out Gendlers 3,500 x 2,800 pixel version of this, as well the vast 6,000 x 6,660 Hubble-only image; the detail in the spiral arms is jaw-dropping.

M83 is pretty close as galaxies go and has been extensively studied. One of my favorite shots of it is from the Spitzer infrared observatory (inset here); that traces the dust in the galaxy that glows in the far-IR. Where you see glowing red filaments is where stars are being born, and massive stars are dying. Both processes create and illuminate the long carbon-based moleculesduststrewn in the spiral arms of galaxies like M83.


Ive written a lot about this galaxy, including the fact that it looks a bit off-center, and that it recently ate another, smaller galaxy. Ive written about the dust in it, too.


I sometimes despair that theres just too much stuff in the Universe to see. I mean, duh, obviously, thats true. Its the Universe. But even nearby there are just so many amazing objects, so much to knowthousands of galaxies surround us in our cosmic neighborhood, and each contains billions of stars, huge numbers of star-forming nebulae, clusters, black holes, exotic compact objects like neutron stars and magnetars  we cant even map everything in our own galaxy, let alone those nearby.


But then I remember how incredible that very fact is. There is wonder and joy and amazement in every direction we look, for as far as our minds and technology allow us to see. Sure, its overwhelming. Its the Universe.


Im OK with that. Really, even more: I wouldnt have it any other way.

Slate,L,Peter Pan played by a woman: Why? A history of casting the J.M. Barrie character.,"When the news that NBC would be airingPeter Pan Live!was first announced earlier this year, Aisha Harris sought out the reason for why the elfin boy who will ""never grow up"" is usually played by a woman. Tonight, the much-discussedspecial will premiere, starring Allison Williams as the titular character and Christopher Walken as Captain Hook, and we've republished the piece below.

Earlier this week, NBC announced plans to follow their hugely successful live version of The Sound of Music with a live adaptation of the musical version of Peter Pan. The choice seems like a no-brainer: Back in 1955, the network aired a live broadcast of the Broadway production starring Mary Martin to 65 million viewers, and that version has since become a beloved cultural institution through subsequent airings and home video.






    Advertisement




What is surprising is the suggested cast. NBC Entertainments chairman initially joked that he wants Miley Cyrus for the title role, then hinted that Peter Pan may be played by a male actor instead. This is a big deal to fans, since the character is nearly always played by a woman. Why have so few men stepped into the role of the eternally young boy?


Initially, the interests of a producer, the logistics of casting, and even English law may have played a part. After that, it became tradition. In his 1979 book, J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys: The Real Story Behind Peter Pan, English writer and director Andrew Birkin recounts the backstory for the first stage productions. Broadway producer Charles Frohman enthusiastically agreed to produce the play, and he made a couple of suggestions to the author. First, that it be titled, simply,Peter Pan;Barries working title was The Great White Father, which is what Barrie has the Indians call Peter. (That phrase has uncertain origins but wasand isused by some Native Americans to refer to white leaders.) Second, Frohman asked that, in America, the starring role of Peter be played by his protg, Maude Adams. Frohman reasoned that a man would be wrong for the part, and if they cast a boy, the other children would have to be scaled down in proportion. English law prohibited the use of minors under 14 on stage after 9 p.m. So a woman it was.


Nina Boucicault, the sister of the shows director Dion Boucicault, was tapped for the lead in England, and she originated the role in December of 1904. (Adams wasnt available to work until the following summer, and so Frohman, impatient to see the play produced, set up the West End production with Boucicault first, in time for Christmas.)


As Birkin explained to me via email, actresses Cecilia Loftus and Pauline Chase were cast in the seasons following the initial London production, and even the 1924 silent movie had a girlBetty Bronsonplaying Peter. From there, casting a woman for stage adaptations became the norm, and the majority of prominent productions have seen a female in the title role.


Jerome Robbins musical version, a vehicle for Mary Martin, extended this tradition. Only one man, Jack Noseworthy, has played this version of Peter on Broadway, andhe was an understudy in Jerome Robbins Broadway, an anthology of musical numbers from various shows (Charlotte dAmboise was the principal Peter Pan). Only one song featured the impish boy character.


There have been a few recent exceptions. Since the 1980s, the Royal Shakespeare Company has frequently employed adult male actors in its production of the play, and is currently doing so with actor Sam Swann. The Broadway and off-Broadway productions of the prequel to Barries story, Peter and the Starcatcher, featured male actors. And in nearly every film adaptation, Peter has been played (or voiced) by a male.

According to Birkin, Barrie always wished to see a boy play Peter on stage, though he never lived to see it occur. (In 1921, he tried to convince Charlie Chaplin to direct and star in a screen version. Chaplin considered it, but the film never came to fruition.) If NBC does wind up casting a male in the part, it will join those other exceptions as a fulfillment of the authors wishes.


What youthful guyaside from the supposedly retired Justin Bieberwould have the star power to pull in ratings the way Carrie Underwood did for The Sound of Music? None come to mind. But Birkin doesnt think age really matters. It's the spirit that's important rather than the letter, he says. I always loved Tyrone Guthries comment, that any actor playing Peter must be as delicate as a moth, as deadly as a bomb.

Slate,L,Tension between Germany and other eurozone countries over stimulus is hurting the economy.,"This article originally appeared in Business Insider.

Poor old Germany. Too big for Europe, too small for the world.


    Advertisement




Thats what former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger famously once said about Germany. And the statement still holds some truth today.


Right now, Germanys politicians and the Bundesbank (the countrys portion of the European Central Bank) arethe two major things holding back more financial stimulus in Europe, which could, if approved, revitalize the continents flagging economies.


Germany has consistently opposedmore monetary stimulus by objecting to interest rate cuts and quantitative easing (QE), a method thatsmeant to push investors away from safe government bonds and into corporate bonds and stocks. German officials are also reliably opposed to less strict deficit targets, which could also boost the economy.


This conservative strategy may work for Germanywhich does not necessarily need quantitative easing (Germanys growth is slow, but unemployment is at a record low)but it does not bode well for more troubled economies like Spain, Italy, and Greece.


The problem is, because all the eurozone countries are bound by a single currency, the euro, they all have to subscribe to the same policies.


Unfortunately for Spain, Italy, Greece, and others, the European Central Bank is built on German foundations and operates in a similarly cautious manner.Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reformexplains:


The ECB was modelled on the German Bundesbank. As a result, it is one of the worlds most politically independent central banks; its mandate is focused narrowly on price stability; it does not take broader economic goals like unemployment into account in the way other central banks, such as the Fed, do; and it is de facto more restricted than other central banks, since controversial measures can lead to complex political and legal struggles, involving 18 (soon to be 19) countries. Its setup and philosophy are therefore ""German,"" that is, conservative and cautious.


In short: The tension between Germany and the eurozone leaders who want more stimulus,like Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi,is partly whats causing thethe near-zero growth and inflation that the region is seeingtoday.


Its hard not to feel bad for Germany, which didnt even want the euro in the first place. Through most of the 1990s, before the euro was introduced, German opinion polls did not support the new currency. The euro was officially adopted in 1999, without the approval from European citizens through a referendum. Only Denmark and Sweden held votes. Both countries rejected it.


In the chart below, you can see that German support for the euro (gray line) remains below support from Europe as a whole (black line) between 1990 and 2011, with the exception of 2007.



  Center for European Policy Studies


 

Theres also some astonishing historical evidence that suggests then-West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl waspushed by French President Francois Mitterrand into accepting the euro.


Today, German politicians are stuck in a vicious cycle. Since most German voters dont favor stimulus measures,the more support these politicians offer to Europe-wide stimulus, the more voters they are likely to lose tothe countrys anti-euro party,Alternative fur Deutschland(AfD).In turn,the more support the AfD gain, the more they are able to influence the debate over Europein German politics, and the more other German politicians have to try to claw votes back from the AfD.

","Affirmative consent, Bill Cosby, feminismwhen you sit down to Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday, women's-issues-in-the-news are bound to be on the table. Here's a guide to talking about some of the stickier gender issues that might come up this holiday season to help get you through. 

Bill Cosby rape accusations


    Advertisement




""If all this happened so long ago, why is it only coming out now?""


Actually, several of these accusations have been out for many years. A comedian named Hannibal Buress recently made pointed jokes about how Cosby is a hypocrite because he lectures everyone else on family values while all these women are accusing him, credibly, of rape, which led to the old accusations bubbling up in the news again, which led to other women coming forward, because there is safety in numbers.


Who is Hannibal Buress?


After dinner, let's watch Broad City on Hulu and I'll show you.


All these women are just out for attention and money!


Hmm. Many of the accusers have never sued Cosby and 13 of them actually offered to testify for one woman who did sue, even though there was no financial gain possible in testifying for someone else. 


ShirtStorm


What's all this about some scientist's shirt on TV?


[Pulls out phone] Matt Taylor of the Rosetta Project wore this shirt during a TV interview. Some people noted that, with so few women in science and engineering fields, perhaps that was not the most appropriate shirt for the male scientist in the spotlight to wear at that time.


Feminists! They can't even let guys wear cool shirts!


The day women can go to work dressed like the women on Taylor's shirt is the day I'll be cool with that shirt! [Ed note: Don't worry, no one will know you cribbed that line from the blogger Heina Dadabhoy.]


I'd be fine with the girls at my office dressing like the girls on that shirt.


Yep, good point.


Campus rape 


What is this ""yes means yes"" business? Students now have to get consent to kiss each other?


Well, Uncle Fred, the affirmative consent law in California defines consent as verbal or non-verbal. I don't really see the problem in policies that say you should only kiss people who want you to kiss them. It's the same idea as only going into someone's house only if they invite you in.


Why don't the girls just go to the police? Why does the university have anything to do with investigating and punishing a crime like rape?


In a lot of cases, girls do go to the police. Just like with underage drinking or drug dealing, just because it's a crime doesn't mean that the school can't also decide if they want to kick you out for doing it.


FEMINISM


It sure seems like women have a lot of power these days!


Then why are all the moms and aunts in the kitchen right now while you're watching football on the couch? But seriously: Women still only make 78 cents to a man's dollar and hold fewer than a quarter of seats in Congress.


I hear Time is going to ban the word ""feminist.""


No. Time does not have the power to ban words. Time is terrible, and thought it would get a lot of traffic by taking a swipe at how trendy feminism has become. Then a lot of people made fun of them.


Blah blah blah political correctness run amuck blah blah blah country is going to hell.

Slate,L,Why female Jacana birds do all the fighting while the males stay home and watch the kids. ,"Excerpted from Animal Weapons: The Evolution of Battle by Douglas J. Emlen. Out now from Henry Holt and Company LLC.

Jacanas are bizarre birds, especially when it comes to their weapons. The female Im watching has especially big spurs, one on each elbow, and she creeps about with delicate steps on very long legs. Her slender toes splay to a span of more than 5 inches per foot, and her gait brings to mind a carnival stilt walker. This female, red-over-blue-and-white right (named for the colored ring bands on her right leg), is making the rounds of her territory, checking the nests of each of her four mates. Her territory is difficult to get to, and we have to watch at a distance from a canoe. Jacanas defend areas of floating vegetation on wide tropical rivers. Panamanians call them Jesus birds because they look like they walk on the water and, in a sense, they do. They tiptoe across their floating mats, dispersing weight with each step over delicate toes, balancing atop the bobbing rosettes of water lettuce and hyacinth.


    Advertisement




This morning, red-over-blue-and-white right is fighting again, as she so often does. An unmarked female had darted in from the adjacent shoreline, hiding in the hyacinth leaves behind one of the males, but our territorial female spots her immediately and closes in. Now, face to face, the two birds size each other up. Crouching low, elbow spurs flared out to the sides, each sidesteps the other in a slow circle. Then red-over-blue-and-white right pounces, leaping into the air and striking the intruder feet first on her way down, slashing out with her spurs. Everything whirls into a blur as both birds leap at each other over and over, crashing together and jabbing as they flail onto the mat of floating lettuce, pop to their feet, and leap once more. And then suddenly the fight is over; the intruder flies away, and the thick air rings with raucous ka-ka-ka-kas as our focal female proclaims victory to birds nearby.


Hundreds of vagrant females forage along the nearby shores of the river. These individuals have failed to secure an island territory of their own, and they challenge the resident females incessantly, pressing and probing, searching for weakness. For vagrants these battles are do or die, since failure to secure a territory is an evolutionary full stop, a dead end. Unless they can find a way to displace one of the owners, their chances of breeding are nil.


Female jacanas are fighters, towering over the males. They are stronger than males, vastly more aggressive, and they have the larger weapons. Sharp yellow spurs jut forward like daggers from each elbow. Bigger females fare better in fierce battles, and as a rule only dominant, top condition females manage to hold a territory for long enough to breed.



Jacanas seem backward. Females are more aggressive than males, they are larger, they fight more viciously and frequently, and they have larger weapons.



Males also fight for territories on the floating mats, though their battles are less vicious and are independent of the wars waged by the females. Males fight with rival males, and successful individuals defend patches of floating greenery sufficient to raise a clutch of chicks. These territories pack into the floating islands like tiles of a mosaic, with the female territories superimposed on top. Some females may be able to shove rivals away from only a single male territory, but the biggest and best females own enough island to house three or four males.


My female is engaged in yet another fighther fourth of the morning. The male shepherds his brand-new chicks as they wobble from plant to plant, all feeding on little insects squirming at the water surface around the lettuce.


The next male over, his territory also nestled within the holdings of red-over-blue-and-white right, still has eggs, and he sits on his hidden nest sheltering his clutch. A third male has nearly grown chicks, and the last male is between broods, ready to begin the process again. Our female, when shes not battling to hold her spot, moves freely among her males, mating with them from time to time. When one of her males is ready, shell lay a clutch of four eggs into his nest. But then she will abandon the eggs to the male and move on, placing her next clutch a few weeks later into the nest of a different male. Male jacanas spend several months tending to young each time they reproduce, preparing nests, incubating eggs, and shepherding the chicks as they grow to independence. Females show up to provide eggs when needed, but otherwise they leave the tending of young to the males.


Jacanas seem backward. Females are more aggressive than males, they are larger than males, they fight more viciously and frequently than males, and they have larger weapons. In the animal kingdom, usually its the other way around. In flies, beetles, mastodons, crabs, and elks, males are armed, not females. Jacanas excepted, in every species with weapons confined to a single sex, males have those weapons. Why should just one sex have weapons? And why is it (almost) always the males?


Females of all animal species produce larger reproductive cells (called gametes) than males. Eggs are bigger than sperm, and this difference in material investment is far more substantial than most of us appreciate. Humans are rather ordinary in this respect, but were a good place to start. The female egg is the largest cell in the human body. It measures almost a fifth of a millimeter acrossabout the size of a period (.) on this pageand its just visible to the naked eye. Sperm are the smallest cells in the body, and 100,000 could fit into the volume of a single egg.


In many animals differences in egg and sperm size are much more profound. A zebra finch mom fits nicely in the palm of your hand. Shes roughly 4 inches beak to tail, but she lays an egg that is more than a  inch across. By weight, a finch egg is 7.5 percent of the weight of her body. Thats equivalent to a human female producing an egg weighing 11 pounds. Kiwis have the most gargantuan of all gametes, relative to their body size: brown kiwi moms lay eggs that are a fifth of their body weight. Our human mom would need to produce a 30-pound egg to comparethe size of an 18-inch watermelon.


Asymmetry in gamete size has consequences that ripple through the biology of animal species. For one thing, females cant produce as many gametes as males do. With the same amount of resources, males produce trillions of sperm. And these numbers stack up fast, since each male produces similarly copious quantities of sperm. A human female produces roughly 400 viable eggs over the course of her lifetime. A male, on the other hand, cranks out 100 million sperm every day, easily 4 trillion over his lifetime. Scale that up to a population of 1,000 people, and there are a quadrillion (thats 15 zeros) more sperm than there are eggs. Scale it to the current human population and there are a septillion (24 zeros) more sperm than eggs. And humans arent even an extreme example. The simple fact is that in virtually every animal species there are nowhere near enough eggs to go around. The result is competition.



 


 

The size of female gametes is important for another reason. Large, nutrient-rich eggs are expensive, and they take time to produce. Depending on the species, females may take days or even weeks to recover from producing one batch of eggs before they are ready to lay another. Males, on the other hand, tend to need only a few minutes. Thanks to their gametes, females generally take longer to turn around between breeding events than do males.


Females also stand to lose more than males if a breeding attempt fails. Although each sex invests nutrients, energy, and time in producing gametes, the amounts they invest are different. Females spend more than males each time they reproduce and, because of this, the cost of abandoning a brood is much steeper for females than it is for males. As a result, whenever additional offspring care is required, its generally the females who provide it.


Females invest in offspring in all sorts of interesting ways beyond simply producing eggs. Cockroach moms hold fertilized eggs inside their bodies until they are ready to hatch, feeding and protecting them in an insect equivalent of a mammalian pregnancy. Scorpions wear bundles of babies on their backs for weeks after they hatch. Dung beetle moms excavate tunnels into the ground and provision their babies with balls of buried dung; a few species even lock themselves inside a crypt for a year so they can guard the young as they grow.


Preparing nests, pregnancy, guarding eggs, and feeding and protecting young all take time. These forms of maternal care can increase the latency between reproductive events still further, compounding the rift in relative investment between the sexes. Males can invest in offspring, too, as they clearly do in jacanas and humans, but its surprisingly rare in the animal world. In most animal species, males provide little more than sperm, and this means they recycle an awful lot faster than females.


Turnaround times are tremendously important for explaining animal weapons because whenever they differ between males and females the result is always competition. If you walk into a population of just about any animal species, and you count how many individuals of each sex are physiologically capable of breeding right now, youll find that all the males are able and willing, but many of the reproductive-age females are not. Some of the females are physiologically unavailableout of commission, so to speakin between broods. Female zebras in the midst of pregnancy cannot conceive new foals. Cow elks cannot start new pregnancies while they are nursing existing young. Females that are locked into a current breeding event are out of the pool since they are not available for conceiving new young. If all of the males are able to breed, but only a fraction of the females are, then there will not be enough females to go around.




Enter natures most pervasive and potent form of competition, what Charles Darwin called sexual selection. Individuals of one sex compete for access to the other. In principle, sexual selection can work both ways, with either males or females competing. In reality, except for rare cases such as the jacana, it almost always involves males competing for access to females. Female jacanas still produce the larger gametes (eggs are bigger than sperm), and it takes them a few weeks to recover between clutches. But this is where female investment stops. Male jacanas spend up to three months tending to eggs and chicks, and as a result their turnaround time is longer than the females. Females recycle roughly three times faster than males (24 days compared with 78 days), translating into almost three times as many reproductively ready females as males on floating territories. At any point in time, roughly half of the males in a population are tied down with existing eggs or chicks, leaving just a few of them free to start new broods while most of the females are yolked up and ready to go. They could lay eggs immediately if only they had access to a territory-holding, reproductively ready male. In jacanas, there simply are not enough receptive males to go around, and females battle it out for the chance to breed. Sexual selection, rather than selection from predators or prey, drove the evolution of blazing yellow spurs in jacana females.

Slate,L,Sian Davey: Looking for Alice is a series about a photographers relationship with her daughter who has Down syndrome (PHOTOS).,"Sian Davey, a mother of four, was pregnant with her youngest child when she was told that there was a good chance her daughter would be born with Down syndrome. While the decision to go through with the pregnancy was an easy one for Davey, it didnt prepare her for what it would be like.

In addition to a fear that her daughter Alice would be treated unfairly in a society that she feels gives little or no value to people with Down syndrome, Davey had concerns about how her family would handle things and even her own expectations for Alice. When you have children with Down syndrome, it becomes about them having Down syndrome, she said. They have a condition, its almost as if they dont have a personality and she wasnt Alice, she was Alice with Down syndrome.

Davey explored various narratives about her relationship with her daughter, as well as her ideas of what her daughter might be experiencing, in the series Looking for Alice, shot on film with a medium-format camera. It is one of many projects in which she has immersed herself since deciding to follow a career as a photographer. (She is currently closing down her 15-year psychotherapy practice.)

When we have a child who doesnt have learning difficulties or Down syndrome, we all project on them that my child is going to be this or that, we immediately have expectations, but I wasnt allowed any here, I was dealing with very different territory, she said. Its a great exercise in looking at oneself and seeing what we do to our children and these expectations we have for them. As a psychotherapist I deal with the fallout of that all the time and it just illuminated and amplified my relationship with my other children.


What I found fascinating was once I got my thinking mind out of the way was the perception of photography as a medium of communication, she said. When the images came back it was extraordinary what was being shown to me and just by putting that intention out there, things were just showing themselves to me without me thinking.


Davey said nearly all of the photos have been taken either inside their home or no more than a 10 minute drive away. Apart from watching the light, staying in the moment is her only parameter when shooting.


I sit back and watch and I can kind of hear and see so Im combining all my senses to whats going on around me.

Slate,L,Gangnam Style was so popular that YouTube had to upgrade its view counter.,"In November 2012, when Gangnam Style overtook Justin Beibers Baby as the most popular video on YouTube, Psys hit had about 800 million views. Looking back, that seems like chump change: The video now has 2.15 billion views.

In fact, that view number has gotten so astronomical that it broke the counter and Google had to build a new one. We never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer (=2,147,483,647 views), but that was before we met PSY, YouTube wrote in a post on its Google Plus page.

Googles old counter could display integers up to 2^31 - 1 or 2,147,483,647. Which probably seemed like plenty whenever it was set up! It couldnt reach 2^32-1 or 4,294,967,296 because one bit was being used to toggle between negative and positive numbers. But since you cant have a negative view count anyway, the system was clearly due for an overhaul.


Gangnam Styles views keep rising, and Google has even added an Easter egg to the videos counter, if you hover over it. Its a brave new world of 64-bit integer view counts.

Slate,L,"Ridley Scotts Exodus: Were ancient Egyptians white, black, or brown?","British actor Christian Bale plays Moses in Ridley Scotts new film Exodus: Gods and Kings, which opens next Friday. Aussie Joel Edgerton (Ramses II) and Idahoan Aaron Paul (Joshua) also star. In response to criticism of the mostly white cast, media mogul Rupert Murdoch tweeted: Since when are Egyptians not white? All I know are. What was the skin color of ancient Egyptians?

Not white. There is not yet enough evidence to make a definitive judgment about the pigmentation of the pharaohs or Moses, who himself was likely an Egyptian. Mummies are too desiccated to reveal skin tone, and the tiny amount of genetic evidence they have yielded so far adds nothing to the question. As the Explainer wrote back in 2011, small differences in bone structure dont reliably indicate the race of a recently deceased person, let alone a 3,000-year-old corpse. We are mostly limited to the subjective statements of Egyptians and the outsiders who depicted them, which suggest that majority of people of pharaonic Egypt were neither white nor black, by modern standards.








Herodotus, for example, referred to the Egyptians as melanchroes. That term is sometimes translated as black-skinned, but Herodotus typically used a different word to describe people from further south in Africa, suggesting that dark-skinned is more appropriate. He also compared Egyptian skin to that of the people of Colchis, in the Southern Caucasus. The Egyptians typically painted representations of themselves with light brown skin, somewhere between the fair-skinned people of the Levant and the darker Nubian people to the south. These paintings, however, may not be entirely reliable, because Egyptian artists didnt always faithfully attempt to recreate reality. They sometimes alternated skin tones of people in a row to create contrast. Men were depicted with darker skin than women to represent gender rolesmen worked in the fields while women stayed in the homeeven when the subjects were royalty who did not engage in manual labor.

Ancient Egypt was a racially diverse place, because the Nile River drew people from all over the region. Egyptian writings do not suggest that the people of that era had a preoccupation with skin color. Those who obeyed the king, spoke the language, and worshipped the proper gods were considered Egyptian. Outsiders were allowed to marry Egyptians. Even the aristocracy was racially integrated. Princesses from the Levant joined the Egyptian nobility. Maiherpri, a dark-skinned Nubian who lived shortly before the reign of Ramses II, was also part of the Egyptian royal court and was buried in the Valley of the Kings.


The skin color of ancient Egyptians is a long-running modern debate, both among scholars and in the lay community, even if the ancient Egyptians themselves didnt much care about it. The last major flare-up came in 2005, when National Geographic launched a traveling exhibition featuring a reconstruction of the face of the boy-king Tutankhamun. A pair of earlier representations had suggested darker skin, and the lighter National Geographic version annoyed some observers. The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia convened a conference at which scholars slammed the depiction as too white. (One participant even compared the bust to a young Barbra Streisand.)* Nearly a decade later, though, the light-brown depiction of King Tut remains as good a guess as any.

Slate,L,Are trolls ruining Slates comment section?,"This article is part of a package of coverage about commenting onSlate. Make sure to also check out ""You Will Not Comment on This Article. And then join other members andSlatestaffers in an open thread discussion,How Should Slate Improve Its Comments Section?

Some Slate writers believe its time for the magazine to stop hosting comment sections below every article. Among other things, they argue that the magazine isnt investing sufficient resources into moderation and that stories about certain topics, such as feminism and race, are often overwhelmed by off-topic vitriol and hate.


We invited four Slate-sters to talk about the state of commenting on the site. In what follows, weve excerpted highlights from a recent exchange between senior technology writer Will Oremus, senior editor Rachael Larimore, senior writer Amanda Hess, and DoubleX contributor Amanda Marcotte.


* * *


Amanda Marcotte: So is this the official beginning of the fierce fight to the death over comments?


Will Oremus: Nicely framed. Hyperbole and death threatsI feel like I'm in an Internet comment section already!


Amanda Hess: I'd like to begin by highlighting an insightful comment I received from a reader after publishing a long reported story about the publisher of a new website for women. It reads: LOL! Why is Amanda Hess on her knees busy spit-shining Bryan Goldbergs business? That is the question.


Oremus: Worst Hamlet allusion ever.



If we're putting ideas out there, I think we have a duty to listen to our readers' responses.
Rachael Larimore



Rachael Larimore: That's a terrible comment, and the kind of thing that should be stricken immediately. Having said that, though, the media and publishing industry owes its existence to the freedom of speech and has a long and dedicated history of promoting the free exchange of ideas.


Hess: Unless we hire Barack Obama as our comment moderator, I'm not sure we're responsible for denying anyone his or her constitutional rights here.


And while the editorial page of a local newspaper was once the only way citizens could respond to the press beyond a soap box in the square, the openness of the Internet means that everyone who comes to Slate to file a comment has access to dozens of platforms where he can say whatever he wants about our work, his thoughts on women, or his breakfast. Let him do that on a server that Slate isnt paying for.


Marcotte: I am personally a huge fan of free speech, which is why I think comment sections should be closed. The problem with them is that they become so overwhelmed by bigots, misogynists, and people who just want to say mean things for the hell of it that all good-faith actors just leave and go elsewhere. I don't know that the best way to protect free speech is to make it impossible for people who actually have something to say to get a word in edgewise.


Larimore: If we're putting ideas out there, I think we have a duty to listen to our readers' responses. If anything, because Slate is a site that features more commentary and analysis and opinion than straight, reported news, we have more of an obligation to hear what people have to say. One hallmark of a quality publication is that it is willing to run responses from readers that point out errors or disagree with its stances.




A Slate Plus Special Feature:

You Will Not Comment on This Article

A primer on commenting on Slate.




Oremus: I worked for four years at a publication with no comment section to speak of. You might suspect that this would be a blissful experience: The soapbox is all mine, and no one can say otherwise. But I never felt this way. I felt more like Gizmodos Matt Novak, who quipped that writing for a site that didnt allow comments was like whispering to myself in the wilderness. Did my points land? Did I change anyones mind? Did a bunch of readers misconstrue my meaning? These are questions that go through my head when I look at a story Ive published.


I want my stories to start a conversation, and I want my readers to feel like they have a voice in that conversation. Thats why I think its worth the effort to improve Internet comments rather than do away with them altogether. To me, even a messy, ugly comments section is preferable to silence.


Larimore: Our readers are already out there commenting on Facebook and Twitter (and maybe Ello, whatever that is). If we keep them in-house, that enables us to have a more meaningful conversation.



Even a messy, ugly comment section is preferable to silence.
Will Oremus

Oremus: It is true that people are free to comment on Slate stories on platforms other than Slate. But this is not an argument for depriving them of the opportunity to comment on Slate stories on the site itself. Twitter and Facebook have their merits, but they're very poor venues for substantive, ongoing, multiperson discussions that are tied to a single, specific article or set of ideas. The ideal venue for that specific sort of conversation remains the comment section of the article itself.


That is not to say that the state of Internet comment sections, or the Slate comment section, is ideal. Far from it. I agree that moderation is essential and also quite difficult, and is rarely done well.


Marcotte: I love the idea of substantive, ongoing, multiperson discussions that are tied to a single, specific article or set of ideas, but that is simply not my experience.


Larimore: I think that there is a difference between hosting comments and making a writer beholden to reading/responding to them. As writers, compared with the commenters, we have the larger and more visible platform. We have the advantage. It's easy to get caught up in the vitriol, but we can also choose to ignore it and remember that far fewer people will ever read the craptastic comments than will see our pieces.


Marcotte: Certainly, we can all ignore the comments. In fact, most writers I talk to agree that you should ignore the comments. But that says a lot about the value of comments. I'm reminded of the rule for cleaning out your closet: If you haven't worn it in a year, throw it out. Same with comments: If you generally regret reading them and just wish you hadn't wasted your precious time, it's time for them to go.


Hess: I've been enjoying our Slate Plus comment sections, where only those with a mutual investment in the site are granted access and where moderators are not just weeding out useless or vile commentary but actually spending a lot of time conversing with commenters, responding to complaints, and setting the tone. It's a worthy goal. I'm just not sure it's worth the investment across the site, given how much content we're producing now. Right now, we're totally half-assing moderation. And I'd vote to put those resources toward paying writers to do great work as opposed to having them hang out in the comment section.




A Slate Plus Special Feature:

How Should Slate Improve Its Comments Section?

A members-only open thread.




Marcotte: Oof, just checking the comment thread under my latest post and the first comment, up top, was a man who used my boyfriend's last name. It's a typical genre of comment I get, the diagnosis of me as a broken, sad person because that's what the commenter wishes were true. But by mentioning my boyfriend by name, the actual message of the comment is that I am being watched, carefully and obsessively, by someone with a rather unhealthy obsession.


Oremus: That is creepy.


Marcotte: I envy writers who feel that their comment sections give any insight whatsoever into how people are genuinely reacting to your arguments. But when it comes to writing that touches on class, race, or gender issues, a cesspool is a near certainty, unless you have rigorous moderation.


Obviously, one problem here is that different comment sections, even within Slate, have different values. 


Oremus: I do think it's true that Internet commenters tend to be overwhelmingly white and male, and that they tend to view comment boards as a safe space to vent all the sexist and racist thoughts that they'd never share in public. And I think stories by and about women and/or people of color come in for disproportionate amounts of abuse.


Hess: I'm curious: Are these the same people? As in, are the commenters who drop into DoubleX to take their dicks out the same ones filing rational and challenging arguments about technology under Will's posts?


Oremus: I've probably overstated the quality of comments I typically get on my stories. Plenty of them are lazy, asinine, or vicious in one way or another. It's just that a) the proportion of personal attacks is much lower on stories about topics that people don't take as personally as, say, gender or race, and b) I've grown accustomed over the years to scanning quickly past the idiotic comments to find those that contribute something of value.


Marcotte: I think comment sections often devolve to their lowest common denominators. Here's a great piece in the Washington Post that explains one reason why: Whoever is the biggest jerk in the comment section will always win the comment section, probably for the same reason that someone who throws up in a subway car invariably empties it out. For some blogs, this isn't really a problem because their lowest common denominator is probably not that bad. Like, with a tech blog, it's probably just going to be the people who compete to see who can be most cynical about the newest gee-gaw on the marketannoying but not hurtful. Feminism, however, attracts a crowd of men who are deeply threatened by the gains that women are making.



The biggest jerk in the comment section will always win for the same reason that someone who throws up in a subway car invariably empties it out.
Amanda Marcotte



Larimore: I dont think that the experience youve had, Amanda, is exclusive to women writing about feminism, and I worry that keeping it narrow makes the solution seem too simple. Ive received plenty of venomfrom men and womenwhenever Ive written about being pro-life. William Saletan is one of our least predictable writers, and whenever he takes a position that much of our audience would consider contrarianeven if hes just playing devils advocatethere are personal insults mixed in with all the intracommenter debating thats going on. No one here thinks that comment sections function as well in practice as they do in theory. People are wedded to their own ideas, they dont like to have them questioned, and many times they can be humorless. Does that mean we burn the house down? Call me stubborn, but I dont like the idea of letting the jerks win.


Oremus: I was really disappointed with Popular Science's decision to shut off comments. I explained why here.


Hess: I don't have time to sufficiently respond to this right now, so I'll just drop in to ask: If you like comments so much, Will, why don't you marry them?


Larimore: Wait wait wait! Is Amanda Hess trolling us?


Hess: It's kind of fun!


Larimore: I think we need to look very hard at the costs that come with giving into the screechy, hostile, angry people. I am opposed to just throwing up our hands and letting trolls win. We have many readers that provide thoughtful commentary, or point out problems, or really pour their hearts out. Cutting them off because there are thoughtless, attention-seeking commenters trying to gum up the works seems self-defeating.


If comments are largely productive and beneficial on most of our sections, then we shouldn't deny those readers who enjoy conversations because of the bad apples. And I worry about the message it sends if we shut down comments to just one section or department. There are incremental stepsblocking specific commenters, making people use real namesthat don't lead to the baby getting thrown out with the bath water.


Hess: I agree that comments sections can be really wonderful with the right moderationTa-Nehisi Coates' comments section is oft cited as a rare jewel, always civil yet challengingbut that takes a lot of time and work.


Oremus: Moderation is onerous, and that is a problem. Human moderation is expensive and slow. No matter their size, most sites can't afford it: Small sites are too poor to pay human moderators, and large sites have too great a volume of comments for human moderators to keep up with. The result is that moderation across the Web tends to be insufficient at best and nonexistent at worst.



Right now, we're totally half-assing moderation.
Amanda Hess
Illustration by Charlie Powell



Another way to improve comment sections is by employing some combination of human moderation and crowdsourced moderation, wherein a comment section relies on its own members to flag or downvote offensive or unhelpful comments. Reddit is an example of a site that relies heavily on upvotes and downvotes, and while Reddit certainly has its share of ugliness, some of the better-moderated subreddits have comment sections that are among the most intelligent, entertaining, and useful on the Web.


Marcotte: I think requiring people to login with Facebook does help with the ugly comments on pieces about race or gender. A lot of people would not like future dates, for instance, to find out what they say anonymously to women on the Internet.


Oremus: That most online comment boards allow people to comment anonymously is another big problem. Anonymity has its merits, and I'm not against it in all cases. But it does make the task of moderation far more difficult. When you ban someone with an anonymous account, he can just start a new one. That makes it harder to make people accountable for anything they say.


Forcing users to log in through something like Facebook or Google Plus is annoying and problematic in some ways, but it does go a long way toward addressing the anonymity/accountability issue. And it's still less heavy-handed than dropping comments altogether.


Hess: I agree that anonymity is a problem. I've found that when people criticize my work on a forum that is more open than Slate's, like Twitter, there is a social imperative for a critic to say, Amanda Hess is being much too easy on this source, instead of Why is Amanda Hess giving this source a BJ?There are at least reasonable actors in those forums who shoot down sexist commentary and demand good-faith arguments. (And even with that it's still really sexist!) Slate has a few commenters like that, and bless them, but our half-assed approach to comment moderation has resulted in a population imbalance between the trolls and the more benign, helpful, interesting, and funny smart-alecks.

I have received a wedding invitation that specifies cocktail attire for the ceremony and reception. My investigation shows that this can mean any number of things. I come from Oregon, where formal attire means choosing ones best flannel and scraping the mud off ones boots. My wife has any number of stunning dresses that would fit the bill, but I dont even own a suit. Is this time to buy one? Please give me some tips for navigating the rocky shoals of proper cocktail attire.


Thank you for your question!


    Advertisement




The concept of cocktail attire originated in the U.S. during Prohibitionnatural timing, given the irony intrinsic to the noble experiment: There was significant personnel overlap between the movement in favor of women getting to vote and the movement against anybody getting to drink, and the abstemious suffragettes supporting the 18th and 19th amendments inadvertently chased their daughters into speakeasies and such. They created the Drinking Womanan ideal rooted in newfound concepts of individuality and a denial of Edwardian matronly functions, as the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art puts it:


She emerged at private cocktail soires and lounges, and the cocktail dress, as a short evening sheath with matching hat, shoes, and gloves, was designated to accompany her. The cocktail affair generally took place between six and eight p.m. Cocktail garb, by virtue of its flexibility and functionality, became the 1920s uniform for the progressive fashionable elite.


At cocktail hour in 2014, a lady can always pass muster by wearing a little black dress. The gentlemanly equivalent of the LBD is a jacket, a necktie, and a nice pair of trousers. If you cant be moved to buy a suit for this occasion, wear that, and wear it in the spirit of a sophisticated adult at ease, not of a teen tugging on his collar at Model U.N., or of an insurance executive soberly departing his retirement party.


Herewith, a cryptanalysis of other enigmatic dress codes that I, and people I know, have encountered on invitations.


Lounge suit. This baffles some Americans living in England, Rhodes scholars and dopey brokers alike. A lounge suit is just a suit: In the 1800s, English men of the upper classes wore strict, sober frock coats for work (if they worked) and lounge suits to play. The original lounge suit was called so because, soft and slack, it was worn to loll about the country or to relax at home. The lounge suit was certainly not acceptable at the bank or the firm, nor at church, nor at highly formal social events in the daytime, nor for anything at all in the evening, Anne Hollander wrote in Sex and Suits. In the 1900s, classes below the upper classespeople who hadnt had the chance to loungestarted wearing them out and about, for business and pleasure, and here we are.



On one level, every party in recorded history has been a Dress to Get Laid party, with the exception of some wakes and brises.



Fancy dress. This is a Britishism meaning costume party. Some British residents of New York City insist on using this phrase on invitations, despite its ambiguity on these shores. Some of those people do it strictly to remind us exactly how British they are, as if were supposed to be impressed. (I say to them, This is America, pal. Learn the language.) If youre ever in doubt about whether a party advertised as a fancy-dress party is a costume party or a formal occasion, then show up wearing a tuxedo, but with a fanciful accessory on hand, such as a feathered mask or a backup bowtie.


Highland dress. This is a Scottish thing: You dont have to wear a kilt, but if you own one, its time to get your tartan-flaunting on. Some Scotsmen wear nothing under their kilts. Some Scotsmen prefer boxer briefs. No true Scotsman argues against the logic of the jockstrap as an ideal underthing.


Grown and sexy. This is a black thing, and Urban Dictionarys lexicographical game is in this instance tight, so heres a lightly edited excerpt of its leading definition: Dont even think of showing up at my function in baggy jeans, Air Jordans, platinum chains, and an XXXL white T-shirt. If youre not in tailored Armani or Versace, stay your ass home! Also, unless its neo-soul, rare groove, or old school, you wont hear it here. Want radio hip-hop? Go to that white kids club in the suburbs.




Dress to impress. The implicit emphasis on ostentation identifies the hosts as probable douchebags. Consider avoiding this party.


Dress to Get Laid. Since back in the day when Bret and Lethem and Ms. Donna Tartt and their peers were enrolled at Bennington College, students have celebrated an infamous pagan ritual of this name. When preparing to attend the debauch, you should cogitate on the fact that, on one level, every party in the recorded history of social life has been a Dress to Get Laid party, with the exception of some wakes and brises. Wear a T-shirt and jeans. Or a kilt and a jockstrap.


Festive holiday attire. You may be tempted to wear something corny. Try not to succumb to temptation. DONT wear a Santa hat unless you arrive at the party in a sleigh. DONT even think about a candy cane in your breast pocket or a poinsettia on your lapel; these accessories would be, in their hokum, only slightly less offensive than a mistletoe belt buckle. DON we now no apparel more gay than a red-and-green cummerbund.


[Fill-in-the-blank] chic. Miami event planners are known to possess, among other vices, a habit of declaring tropical chic dress codes. Native-born Herald reporters and Eurotrash art collectors alike know how to interpret this: linen pants, no socks. A son of San Antonio, describing a gala where the guys wore Western chic, recalls the footfalls of a stampede of Luccheses: It was very J.R. Ewinga lot of jean-and-jacket combinations, bandannas, turquoise, bolo ties, real tuxedos, and Texas tuxedos. Last month the society page of the Times-Picayune told New Orleans ladies what to make of summer chic and saucy chic, saying of the latter, I foresee a lot of low-cut shirts.  Possibly leather, too. And if that's what the host is going for, so be it. As you read this, invitations mandating Yuletide chic togs for would-be eggnog tipplers are sitting in mailboxes all across the country.


This columnist has mixed feelings about these developments. Of course, we always appreciate gentle reminders about trying climates and difficult terrain. (If a wedding is held on the sand at a beach resort, you want a heads-up, so that you know to wear boat shoes with your lightweight suit for the sake of gaining the traction youll need to evade hotel security at 3 a.m.) And, of course, we cant quite disapprove of the bride and groom whotrue storyexplicitly discouraged seersucker on the invitation to their Cape Cod wedding. (They were fearful that their guests would fashion costumes from the fabrica kind of drag show of preppy appropriation. They were trying to save guests from themselves.)


But the ____ chic formula prompts wondering worries: Isnt this rather controlling? Isnt it somehow vain? Is the host trying to throw a party or supervise a photo shoot?


Classy. A colleague looks back on a New Years Eve party at a friends apartment: The friend was an event planner who also does interior decorating, so when she wrote classy, I think everyone kind of got the idea. Shes a Very Certain Type. (Loves wearing sequins on a Monday, weird vintage hats, etc.) For the most part the ladies wore little black dresses or nice vintage dresses with pumps. The dudes wore button-ups and jeans. Which, IDK? It didnt seem like they tried that hard.

Business casual. We all know the adage: To dress for success is to dress for the job you want, not the job you have. That is generally a good policybut have you ever studied photos of media moguls pretending to relax at Herb Allens annual thing? Only a degenerate careerist would sacrifice his style to emulate the epic shlubbery of Sun Valley business casual. Its awfulpro-shop ski vests over tropical shirts and Rupert Murdoch under a baseball cap and worse. The photos present evidence that some guys who wear business suits all the time simply have no idea what to do when unprotected by their constraints. Many of those zillionaires look unemployed, and unemployable.


Smart casual. The idea is to respect the spirit of business casual without looking stupid. Wear an OCBD, chinos, old-school canvas sneakers, andits a shame to have to spell it outa belt.


Artsy casual. You should wear a sack jacket, an untucked polo shirt, dark jeans, and freshly polished leather shoes, and if at all possible show up slightly stoned.


Casual cocktail. This is like a dog whistle telling women to wear flats, Tory Burch, probs. (h/t Shannon Elizabeth)

Slate,L,Beards: History and theory of male facial hair and comedy.,"Brian Petre has a bushy, auburn beard, and hes somewhat overweight. In other words, hes funny. Everything I do makes people laugh, he says. I used to shave every day so I wouldnt have to deal with it, but then finally I gave in. In the middle of 2012, Petre quit his job as a carpenter and welder for Cirque du Soleil, and set out for the Vegas Strip in a pair of aviator shades and a T-shirt. He spent the next 18 months working full-time as a Zach Galifianakis impersonator, earning as much as $150 per hour and getting flown around the country for weddings and conventions. Im not a hustler, he says. I didnt really have to try. People wanted to laugh because of the beard, and all I had to do was finish the punch line.

Slate,L,How Yahoo could make up for its decision to sell Flickr users' photos.,"Every day, millions of people post their thoughts and pictures on Facebook and its Instagram subsidiary. Millions more post on Twitter, and Pinterest, and upload videos on YouTubeall participating in a modern ritual that enriches these third-party platforms while providing, in most cases, a satisfying experience to the uploaders. Apart from a few superstars who have special arrangements with these services, the contributors don't get a cut.

But when Flickr, the photo sharing service owned by Yahoo, decided to start selling pictures its users had uploadedphotos licensed by their creators for royalty-free commercial reusethere was a sense that Yahoo had crossed some kind of line.


    Advertisement




It's a somewhat complicated situation, but it highlights a longstanding unease in this arena. Are we getting a fair trade for what we so willingly give to these giant companies? Most people would say yes, but the digital world includes an evolving marketplace that has a long way to go before it reaches equilibrium.


The Flickr case looks from here like mostly good intentions run awry. Flickr has picked images from its vast photo library and plans to monetize them by reselling custom wall artexcellent prints mounted on premium paper or canvas. Some photographers, selected by Flickr, will share revenues. So far, so good.


What's not so good: Many Flickr users who uploaded using a Creative Commons licensea copyright method that reserves only some rights, not all rightswon't get a dime when their pictures are sold. Yahoo is reselling photos the users uploaded under a license often abbreviated as CC-BY (here's a link to the latest version), which permits reuse as long as credit is given to the original artist. Yahoo has every legal right to do this. Still, it clearly rankles some people, though when the Wall Street Journal contacted 14 Flickr users whose work was included in the new offering, eight said it was fine with them.


There are a couple of remedies for people who don't like Flickr's initiative. One is to remove pictures from the archive, and refrain from posting more. Another, for future uploads, is what I do when I post pictures at Flickr. I use a more restrictive Creative Commons license: CC-BY-NC. This means I'm freely licensing the picture for reuse by anyone, but only for noncommercial purposes. (I do the same with my books and my personal blogging.) So my photos aren't in Flickr's for-sale section, not that they're interesting enough that anyone would want a large print in any event.


Yahoo is being ham-handed here, no question. On a mail list I frequent, Nathan Matias, an MIT Ph.D. student, made one suggestion for how Yahoo could soften the indignation: invite all purchasers of photographs to send a note of acknowledgment or appreciation to the photographera thank-you note for the generosity demonstrated by donating the work to the public. Gratitude is a key element in the sharing/volunteer economy, as he also notes in a blog post.


I'd go further and say Yahoo should voluntarily share the wealth across the board, unless the photographer declined. Yes, this would add administrative costs. But imagine the goodwill it would generate.


Also imagine the goodwill the Huffington Post would have generated if it had shared just a couple of million dollars from the more than $300 million AOL paid for the site in 2011 with bloggers who'd posted for free and whose work had given the publication its early credibility. There was no legal obligation whatever to do thisthe bloggers were told clearly that they weren't getting paidbut even a relatively small financial nod in their direction would have been seen as a highly ethical move.


Likewise, the people behind the Oculus Rift virtual-reality goggles, who sold the company to Facebook for $2 billion after members of the public crowdfunded the early development, might have offered something more than their hollow thanks to the people who donated via Kickstarter. Equity would have been impractical, and no one who contributes to a project via Kickstarter and other crowdfunding services should be confused about what they're doing. But it's hard to blame folks for feeling like they'd been used.


It's reasonable to have contempt for business models that run along these lines: You do the work, we'll collect the money, and thank you very much. It's unreasonable to expect every service to pay every user. But the Flickr mess is an invitation to rethink a lot of things in this digital age, including copyright and sharing and fundamental fairness.


Someday, I hope to see a social service emerge that either is entirely decentralizedwhere the users quite literally own everythingor limits its financial investors' returns on the principle that the users are also investors, of time and effort. Given modern norms and laws, I won't hold my breath on that one.

Slate,L,Sheldon Adelson may have spent too much fighting Internet gambling: The Las Vegas billionaire shouldnt have made himself part of the story.,"Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and his wife, Miriam, contributed almost $100 million to Republican candidates and related organizations in 2012, and another $5 million in 2014. Not surprisingly, the billionaire wants something in return. That something is legislation to outlaw online gambling. But Adelson may have overplayed his hand by putting too much into the potand in the process providing a cautionary lesson in why spending so many millions may actually be counterproductive,

It all began in 2011. Up until December of that year, the Justice Department treated Internet betting as illegala violation of the Wire Act of 1961. But in late 2011, the Justice Department changed its position. It decided that only online sports betting was illegal; other types of betting like online pokerwhere most of the online gambling action iswere no longer prohibited. That was obviously bad news for brick-and-mortar casino owners like Adelson who have no online presence. If poker players could ante up in their pajamas, why travel to Las Vegas?



If you spend $100 million and you cant get your bill passed, what gives?



Earlier this year, the odds on Adelsons online gambling ban looked good. In March, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Jason Chaffetz introduced the Restoration of Americas Wire Act, a bill to make online gambling illegal, and did so with solid bipartisan support, including Democrats Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii as co-sponsors. House Speaker John Boehner appears to have been on board, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was on board, too. (Reid always had a detente with Adelson, given their mutual interest in the Nevada travel and tourism business.) But the bill lingered. Then, a House hearing was scheduled for December. The idea, it seems, was to get it passed quietly.


    Advertisement




Then, last month, former Rep. Ron Paul spoke out, calling the bill payback to Adelson and therefore the worst form of cronyism. Amid dissension among the Republican ranks, the hearing was postponed. The quiet politics of doing Adelson a favor had become noisy. And the noisy politics of doing Adelson a favor are bad for those who would do the favor. Now there was no way to push the bill forward without it looking like the worst type of corruption. If I were a betting man, Id put good money down that Adelson will not get his Internet gaming ban in this Congress.


If Adelson loses, should we then conclude that money doesnt buy results? After all, if you spend $100 million and you cant get your bill passed, what gives? As with all other ways we spend money, there are ways to spend money intelligently in politics and ways to spend it dumbly. So, what did Adelson do wrong?


Adelsons biggest mistake is that he spent too much money. Spending $100 million in such public fashion is a great idea if you want to obtain a certain type of celebrity. It also works well if you want presidential aspirants begging for your largesse. But its actually a bad idea if you want to get anything done because it makes you the story. And unless you are a sympathetic character (which Adelson is most definitely not), it is not good to be the story.


Good politics might be described as the art of cloaking your special interest in the general interest. But when you become the symbol of big money in politics, it is very hard to pull off this sleight of hand.


Adelson caught on to this axiom late in the game. In February, he told Politico, When I started to imagine what would happen with legalized Internet gaming, it scared the heck out of me  because of whats its going to do to our society.  Im concerned about college students. They are of age, and Im concerned about poor people who really cant afford to do it, that were putting all these temptations smack on their kitchen table.




Hes doing his best to lend legitimacy and moral urgency to his cause. Hes set up the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, with former Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln, former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, and former New York Gov. George Pataki as co-chairs. Hes gotten Judicial Watch to investigate the Obama administrations decision to change the interpretation of the Wire Act, alleging that the move allowed companiesand big Democratic Party donorswith connections to Attorney General Eric Holder to amass huge profits. The coalition has even taken to BuzzFeed with its highly shareable listicle: 10 Reasons Why Internet Gambling Is a Bad Bet. Adelson even took a page from the old Jack Abramoff casino lobbying playbook, getting a laundry list of Christian family values groups to sign on to his antionline gambling cause. 


But online gaming companies arent sitting still. After all, they have their entire business at stake here. Theyre fighting backhard. Theyve activated the Poker Players Alliance, which channels the energy of those who love playing poker and dont want to have their online poker cut off. Theyve aggressively lobbied on the issue and have a very active social media presence. And unlike Adelson, the online gaming industry does not have a visible mega-donor.


Specifically, the online gaming folks have built alliances among libertarians, including a special relationship with Grover Norquist. Norquist, along with leading conservative organizations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the American Conservative Union, has come out against the federal ban on Internet gambling. Right-wing think tanks like the Heartland Institute have taken to calling the bill Crony Socialism.


Of course, one could argue that had Adelson not given so generously, the bill to ban online gambling wouldnt have gotten as far as it has, and instead nobody would be even discussing it. That may be true. But my guess is that if Adelson had given only a few hundred thousand to campaign organizations (still putting him among the ranks of the top donors) and instead put most of his $100 million into a message machine to call attention to the dangers of online gaming, hed have been better off.


Adelson always faced longish odds. Defenders of the status quo (in this case the online gaming industry) always have a built-in advantage. Because Adelson needs a change in the existing policy, he needs to pass a bill. That is always hard to do, given the many veto points in the U.S. system of government, which is especially true in the current Congress. Adelsons opponents only need to undermine the urgency for action, and creating doubt and dissent is a very good way to accomplish that.


Perhaps Adelson will still find a way to tuck his proposal into must-pass legislation, and we will read stories of how money directly buys policy. But if he gets what he wants, it will be because he built the necessary coalitions and alliances, neutralized the American Gaming Association on the issue, and then had his allies use congressional procedural legerdemain. He will have won, despite the fact that he spent his $100 million poorly. 


Whatever happens, the larger point is that politics is neither a vending machine nor an auction. Strategy matters, and changing the status quo is always hard, especially when its defenders have their livelihood at stake. In Washington, money helps a great deal, but it isnt a simple transaction.

Slate,L,Hosni Mubarak freed in Egypt: Its futile for revolutionaries to charge dictators.,"Last week an Egyptian court dismissed charges against former President Hosni Mubarak, who had been accused of stealing from the state treasury and ordering troops to fire on civilians during mass protests in 2011. The collapse of this trial was the latest failure of a global effort to end the impunity of government leaders who order subordinates to engage in human rights abuses. This effort is futile. Its past time for commentators to understand that the principle that no person is above the law, especially those at the top, is a slogan, not a principle, one that can rarely be lived up to because it misdiagnoses the politics of revolution.

Mubarak was the authoritarian leader of Egypt for 30 years. He rigged elections, jailed political opponents, presided over a notoriously brutal security apparatus, censored the press, and banned political rallies. He was tremendously corrupt; he and his family accumulated $1 to $5 billion during his reign.



In all of history, hardly any overthrown leaders have been subject to a trial.



The Economist, from which I quoted above, eagerly anticipated Mubaraks trial, proclaiming the urgent need for the open and speedy dispensing of proper justice for all serious offences, Mr. Mubaraks trial to the fore. So did many other commentators, as did the revolutionaries themselves. No one seemed to realize how unusual such a trial would be. In all of history, hardly any overthrown leaders have been subject to a trial. If you exclude trials by foreign powers (the Nazi leaders at Nuremberg, the Japanese leaders at Tokyo, former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein), you have a short list, indeed. Charles I (1649), Louis XVI (1792), and a few others in the past few decades, whose trials have largely been charades, like that of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Most revolutionaries either slaughter their deposed enemies or chase them into exile. When an authoritarian regime makes a peaceful transition to democracy (as is usually the case), the former authoritarian leaders are immunized from prosecution as part of the deal.


    Advertisement




There is a reason for this. All dictators maintain power by drawing on the support of vast numbers of people, including the elites. All of those people are complicit in the dictatorship, and so if the dictator is to be tried, then they must be as well. Even if they are not charged immediately, the trial of dictator will implicate them and throw into doubt their security from further prosecution. A country can function only if the bulk of the populationincluding most of the former dictators supporters and the elites who populate the military, bureaucracy, and higher reaches of the economycooperates with the new regime. If the new regime cant make peace with them and immunize them from prosecution, then the only alternative may be civil war or social disintegration.


Thus, the United States found itself unable to prosecute all the Nazis and ultimately used various subterfuges to reintegrate all but the worst into society. In Japan, the United States spared the emperor and numerous war criminals high and low. In most of the peaceful transitions (Spain, Greece, Portugal in the 1970s, Eastern Europe in the 1990s, South Africa), members of the old regime were left alone or subject to minor restrictions. In Iraq, the United States blew it by trying to destroy the entire Baathist establishment. Partly as a consequence, the country lies in ruins.


In Egypt, the Muslim BrotherhoodMubaraks only real political oppositioncame to power in 2012 and was driven from office a year later after popular protests against President Mohamed Morsi spurred the military to stage a coup. Morsi wanted to prosecute Mubarak, but now its Morsis turn to be in the dock. While Morsi won an election, he was not able to keep the country together for longer than a year.


Morsi alarmed the Egyptian public, especially liberals, because he seemed intent on consolidating power and becoming an authoritarian himself, with the goal (unlike Mubarak) of imposing religious law, Iran-style. Indeed, Mubarak was friendlier to womens rights and education, and religious tolerance, than Morsi was. And while Egyptians understandably wanted to get rid of Mubarak, by developing-world standards, Mubarak was not a terrible leader.


During Mubaraks 30-year reign, the Egyptian economy grew at a moderate, healthy rate, thanks in part to reforms implemented in the 1990s. Real gross domestic product per capita (in current U.S. dollars) increased six-fold, from $509 to $2,972. According to data from the World Bank, literacy for adults increased during this period from about 44 percent (in 1986) to 72 percent. (For women, the increase was from 31 percent to 64 percent.) The mortality rate for children younger than 5 fell from 166.1 to 22.8 per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth increased from 58 years to 71 years. The number of women compared with the number of men enrolled in universities increased from 46 percent to 91 percent. The percentage of the population living at $2 per day fell from 28 percent (in 1991) to 15 percent (2008).


During this period, Mubarak faced significant challenges to security. From within, he faced terrorist groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic Jihad, which assassinated his predecessor, Anwar Sadat. Although Mubarak was heavily criticized for the violence he used against his political opponents, he kept his country together and contained Islamic extremism. Compared with Syria and Iraq, where ISIS roams about, beheading, crucifying, and enslaving its enemies, Egypt is a paradise. Under Mubarak, Egypt avoided the civil war that is raging in its neighbor Libya, and the mass killings that took place in another neighbor, Sudan.


Mubarak also conducted a moderate foreign policy. Until Sadat made peace with Israel in 1978, Egypt was at war repeatedlyand not just against Israel. Mubarak resisted pressure to repudiate the peace deal and has not gone to war with a foreign state, except as an ally of the United States against Saddam Hussein in 1990-1991. Instead, Mubarak acted as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians. In a neighborhood full of bloodthirsty dictators, Mubarak showed considerable restraint.


None of this excuses Mubaraks corruption, but it helps to explain why the Egyptian revolutions Thermidor came as quickly as it did. For all its problems, the Egyptian state functioned. Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood overreached by seeking a transformation of society that would have thrown it into permanent turmoil. A trial of Mubarak would have played into their hands. The military and elite in Egypt could not let that happen.

Slate,L,"Chicago minimum wage vote: $13 by 2019, including for domestic workers. ","On Tuesday, Chicago's city council voted to raise the city's minimum wage from $8.25 an hour to $13 an hour by 2019.The move is a boon to all low wage workers, but especially domestic workers, specifically nannies, because the council also closed a loophole that had previously exempted domestic workers from the law. Parents in Chicago can no longer equate their kid's regular nanny with a teenage babysitter who does a couple of hours on the weekend. Nannying is a real job and has to be paid like one in the city of Chicago now.

""This groundbreaking vote means that Chicagos household workers will finally gain the same protections that most other workers have had for decades, Myrla Baldonado of theLatino Union of Chicago said in a statement. ""Domestic workers often go unrecognized, but the caring work that they do makes all other work possible.

Of course, it's unknowable how many domestic workers will actually benefit from this change, since domestic labor is often a cash-only business that allows employers to dodge paying Social Security taxes. There's very little that can be done to force people to stop paying domestic workers off the books. However, one of the benefits of a minimum wage hike is it improves everyone's bargaining power. If a nanny is currently getting paid under the table but knows she can get more money on the books, her employer might consider giving her a raise to keep her.


Closing this loophole is a start, but fixing the problem of chronically underpaid domestic workers will take more than this bill. Part of the reason so many underpay their nannies is that it's nearly impossible for many families to afford quality child care without cutting some corners. Instituting federally subsidized day care of the sort found in places like France could go a long way toward fixing that problem, both by giving families a reliable source of affordable day care and giving professional child care workers employment opportunities that come with better pay and benefits. But recognizing that domestic labor is real labor, and should be paid accordingly, is a good first step in the right direction.

The New Yorker,L,Reverend,"

 


After his mother died, Thomas started thinking about his father. All too frequently, while she was dying, there had been talk of her going to meet him in Paradise, returning to the arms of her husband of thirty-two years, who had died thirty-two years before she did. This would be bliss. Thomas did not believe in such things, of course, though it was hard not to try to imagine them, if only to savor the impossibility of the idea: the two insubstantial souls greeting each other in the ether, the airy embrace. She had been ninety at death, he sixty. There would be some adjustment for that, presumably, in Heaven. The madness of it confirmed ones skepticism. But even assuming that she had gone to meet him, who was he? Who was he now? Who was he then? Who was my father? Thomas thought. And why was he asking himself these questions now? That wasnt clear. They werent exactly urgent. On the other hand, they werent going away. He didnt feel like doing research, putting his fathers name into Google or delving into archives. He could have looked at his fathers old sermon notes. Thomass sister had taken some papers when their mothers house was sold, after the funeral. The notes would have told him something, reminded him of his fathers handwriting, of the way the man thought. But he didnt want to do that. The thought of his fathers sermons aroused unpleasant emotions. It was difficult to put his finger on the reason. A sense of embarrassment and irritation. What he wanted, rather, was to assemble a picture of his father as he, Thomas, remembered him. Who was he for me? A son should be able to say what his father was for him. What part of my personality do I owe him? How does this man still simmer in my life? If he does. Occasionally, Thomas would tell himself that he regretted not having asked his mother more about his father while she was alive. That would surely have been the moment to undertake this reappraisal. Now all his mothers memories of his father had died with her. Hed never be able to access them. Yet he didnt actually regret not asking her. The truth was that for all this chatter about her going to meet him in the beyond, for all her occasional tears when Father was mentioned, Thomass mother had spoken very little of his father. Very little. Perhaps the only time his name could reliably be expected to come up was when Thomas and his mother argued over something, usually something of a religious or political nature. Thomas could be provocative, stubborn, and his mother never wanted to lose an argument about things that mattered. Then, between exasperation and amusement, she would say, Youre just like your father, Thomas. He loved to play devils advocate, too!  How was this possible? His father had been a clergyman. Thomas couldnt remember the man expressing a single idea that went against orthodox Christianity. How could Mother remember him playing devils advocate? Presumably, in their own private relationship, Father had liked to get her riled, flustered, indignant. And this had been partly, though perhaps not altogether, in fun. He loved to split hairs, just like you, Thomass mother said, shaking her gray head. She did not say which hairs Father had split, and Thomas had not asked her to expand. Why hadnt Thomas questioned her reticence during her lifetime? It was not that he suspected that there was some secret being hidden from him. It was more as though shed wanted to keep the man to herself. Perhaps she had been afraid that speaking of Father to Thomas would diminish him. Because Father was so devout and Thomas such a doubter. Speaking about him might have given her son a chance to make some disparaging remark, or simply to show once again that he didnt believe. To rock the boat. That was a favorite expression of Fathers: Dont rock the boat! In any event, she had kept whatever there was between them in her heart, to the end. In her bedroom, there was a photo of Thomass father as a young man, and on the glass frame below his face she had placed a small square of white paper with a few lines of religious poetry: Death hides But it cannot divide. Thou art but on Christs Other side. Thou with Christ And Christ with me And so together Still are we.  Thomas respected this carefully preserved bereavement. He didnt investigate. He knew that when the cancer had gone to his fathers brain he had accused his mother of all kinds of unpleasant things and that this had upset her greatly. Never for one moment did Thomas imagine that there was any truth in those accusations. It was just that the cancer had gone to Dads head. And who does one accuse, when accusing, if not ones wife of thirty years? Thomas knew plenty about that. It even occurred to him that he was thinking about his father now because, in separating from his own wife, he had undone, as it were, the last thing that his father had done as a clergyman, when hed married them, Thomas and his wife, holding their ringed hands one above the other and declaring, Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. Recently, in preparation for the divorce, Thomas had had to dig out the marriage certificate with Fathers signature on it. It seemed odd to think that his fathers hand had pressed on that very paper. Thirty-two years ago. His handwriting was scratched and sharp, but not without a certain angular elegance. Thomas examined the certificate for a few minutes, looking at his own signature, his wifes, his fathers, then put it in an envelope with the other papers, ready for his divorce. Whore. That was it. Just once his mother had talked about it. They had been speaking about her cancer, he remembered. She was lucky, she said, because hers hadnt gone to her head. Like poor Dads. Then she burst into tears and told Thomas that, in his madness before he died, Father had said all kinds of awful things; he had called her a whore. Shocked, Thomas immediately reassured his mother that it had been the disease speaking. She knew that. In his right mind Dad would never have said such a thing. Later, Thomas realized that she had told him this in order to receive his reassurance before dying herself. Once reassured, she didnt tell him anything else. Edward Sanders was born in Liverpool, on the longest day of the year, in 1920. Hed had two sisters, one definitely younger. Perhaps both had been younger. Thomas could have asked his own brother or sister about thisthey were older than him, they might knowbut he didnt want his brother and sister to know that he was thinking about his father. Why not? He didnt want to pool their collective memories. He didnt want to have to adjust his views in the light of their knowledge. Vaguely he was aware that Mother had spoken of Fathers being fond of Doris, the youngest sister. But, so far as he could recall, Father had never spoken of her. He had never spoken of his mother, either. All Thomas remembered, from perhaps two visits when he was very small, was a tiny old woman with white wispy hair and a hooked nose. Was his father deliberately enigmatic? Edward Sanders had talked once of his father, Thomass grandfather. They were on holiday in South Devon, and Father had wanted to visit Plymouth Sound, because his fathers ship had been mothballed there during the Great Depression. Thomass grandfather had been a ships captain, and Father had spent an unemployed summer with him on that ship, waiting for world commerce to start moving again. It must have been a happy time for him, because he got quite excited as they walked along the shore, pointing out where the ship had been, the landing stage theyd rowed to when they went ashore. Thomas had the impression that his father had wanted to become a seaman, too, but had been held back by his poor eyesight. His eyesight was so poor that neither the Army nor the Navy had accepted him. He couldnt even get a drivers license. So while his own hero father had fought submarines in the Atlantic, hed worked in Cammell Laird shipyard, doing technical drawings for marine engines. One of the happiest stories Father liked to tell was about how he was admired for his ability to hit rats with a paperweight in the shipyard workshops. It was strange to think that he couldnt see well enough to join the Navy or drive a car but was perfectly capable of drawing engines and hitting rats with paperweights. Father had never spoken of his reasons for becoming a clergyman. But Thomas did know that his father and mother had initially planned to be missionaries. They had met at missionary training college. They had wanted an adventurous life. It was 1948; theyd just lived through a war, but only on the edge of the action. She had been bombed in London, he in Liverpool. Her father had forbidden her to join the Wrens. His father had been disappointed that his son couldnt enlist. Now they would fight the good fight another way. Thomass parents marriage, he realized now, was based on a religious mission. They were partners in a task: to make the world a better place by converting people to the faith. That was the logic of their being together. If either of them lost this faith, their marriage would be lost with it. Wouldnt it? Their life was a life in the Church, for the Church, though, for reasons that were never explained, they hadnt in the end become missionaries. Perhaps having produced children made them less eligible. The Church didnt want to be responsible for little white children in Uganda or Indonesia. Maybe we children blocked Fathers career, Thomas thought. We frustrated his ambitions. First the eyesight problem, then his children. He remembered the mans impatience. His father had no time for chatter. Sometimes he barely took time to eat. He was impatient with Mother, too, impatient to be doing. But doing what? Winning souls for Christ. How strange. And how disappointing for him, then, to have failed first and foremost with two of the three souls under his nose, Thomas and his older brother. He took our salvation for granted, Thomas thought. Once he had decided to make the effort, it didnt take Thomas long to gather these thoughts and type them on his computer. If only because there were so few. Thomas was living in a small flat now, away from his wife, whom he had left some time ago. Away from his children, who were grown up now. They no longer needed him for protection. Only for financial support. Yet he did not feel as though he had really got away. It was as if he had left home to climb a mountain and was now stuck on top of it, bivouacked above the tree line, free, but freezing, with no way forward. Thomas was perplexed. His wife was down in the warm pastures waiting for him. So it seemed. But he wouldnt go back. Permission to treat the witness like gum stuck to the bottom of my heel?Buy the print  There were memories of infancy and memories of adolescence. There were two or three incidents that seemed important. Watershed moments. During Thomass early childhood, his father had seemed busy and happy. He preached and led meetings. First in Manchester, then in Blackpool. He was charismatic and embattled. He liked a fight. His voice was vibrant. He made jokes. He was a leader. People came to him for advice. At breakfast and lunch and dinner he said grace. In the evening, before bed, he said prayers. They were fervent, earnest prayers, the prayers of someone going to Heaven, or to Hell. He wasnt interested in empty, formal religion. He liked his lamb and his roast beef, his plum pie and his custard. But he was always impatient to be up and doing again. Thomas distinctly remembered his father thrusting his chair back and wiping gravy from his mouth with a white napkin. People said serviette then. His father had had a rather slack mouth, poor teeth, but he was always clean-shaven. He was always ready to be meeting people. To be saving their souls. Thomas could actually see the gravy stain on the crumpled napkin as his father hurried off. But he couldnt see his fathers face. Thomas tried and tried, but he couldnt quite see it. In the small apartment he lived in now, he kept no photos of the past. He had no family heirlooms. What had Father looked like? A thin handsome nose, definitely; sandy hair, but receding; gray-green eyes, very thick spectacles. Father was endlessly cleaning his spectacles, usually with a huge white handkerchief. Thomas could see the vigorous action of the hands rubbing the lenses with the cloth. But he couldnt put eyes and nose together. He couldnt remember looking into those eyes, or them looking into his. The handkerchief was in the way. Fathers body was easier. Thomas remembered an aura of vulnerability, at once wiry and hunched, tense. But not intimidated. He didnt keep fit, but rode a bike to visit parishioners. At the church, they hated him, because he had banned the annual crowning of the May Queen. It was paganism, he said; it had nothing to do with Our Lord Jesus Christ and his message of joy and salvation. He hadnt become a clergyman to perpetuate pagan rituals and crown pretty girls. Once, Father took Thomas to a holiday camp with some boys from a reform school. That was frightening. They were wild. They jumped off swings in motion to see who could leap the farthest. They yelled swearwords and made rude gestures. Some of them had been sent to the school for robbery or violence. Father didnt seem to have any trouble talking to these boys or saving their souls. Perhaps he felt that it was missionary work. He felt fulfilled. If Thomas had sworn or made those gestures, Dad would have been furious. It was also scary when Father talked about death and burials. There was a story about a coffin that floated in the muddy water after a storm and another that had to be forced down into the grave, because it was too long. The corpse had been a giant. In the end, Dad and the sexton had had to stand on the coffin to get it underground and even then they buried it at a forty-five-degree angle. It seemed strange to Thomas that his father could laugh at death. It seemed strange when he changed from his ordinary clothes into his robes, the long black cassock and starched white surplice, when he raised his arms outward and upward at the end of the blessing, so that he was like an angel. May the Lord bless you and keep you! His voice rang around the brown stones of the church. May the Lord cause his face to shine upon you! Later, the same man would chase Thomas and his brother back to bed if they crept down the stairs to spy on guests. Scalawags! he yelled. Sometimes he got seriously angry with Thomass brother and spanked him. I will have the last word, he said. I will thrash the stubbornness out of you. It was frightening. But reassuring, too, in a way. Thomas had never been spanked, that he could recall. I was the good boy, he realized. Or the shrewd one. When Thomas was nine or ten, his father had had a breakdown. Nervous breakdown was the expression they used then. He had been supposed to preach. The moment had come to go up into the pulpit, but he had been unable to. He had had to go home. Perhaps the pagan people of Blackpool had finally got the better of him. Afterward, Thomass family had gone on the longest holiday they ever took together. A month in Devon. They had stayed in an abandoned zoo, of all things, sleeping in old animal houses that had been converted into holiday cabins. Soon after Fathers breakdown and that holiday, they had left Blackpool and moved to London. This was one of the watersheds, and, looking back, Thomas realized that his memories of Father from this point on were rather different, rather sadder. The expression new challenge was used, though Thomas didnt know who had said it. Dad was given a new challenge: a big church in a thriving well-to-do suburb of London. People in high places believed in him. He was a man who needed to give energy where energy would be well received. An evangelical cannot thrive in a world of May Queens. Or not for long. At school, Thomas had to drop his northern accent to avoid being laughed at. Did Father have to change his accent in the pulpit? To suit the good folk of North London? Thomas had no recollection. Thinking about this now, he found it odd. Life had slipped by unnoticed. Or perhaps he, Thomas, at ten years old, had been so focussed on his new lifethe need to make new friends, the new vicarage with the big garden, the bus to school, and later the bus and tube to another school, right in the heart of Londonso taken by all this novelty that he had barely noticed his father, who went on preaching in much the same way, it seemed to Thomas, albeit from a different pulpit. Did he have any recollection of talking to Father, one on one, during this period, in his adolescence, about anything that mattered? Girls, sex, religion, smoking, drinking? He did not. He really didnt. What Thomas did remember, though, was the growing antagonism between his father and his brother, and his fathers frustration over his sisters failure at school. He remembered these things because they had caused him pain. His sister was a good Christian, but not smart. One day, she had run away from school, because she couldnt face her teachers. Father was angry with her. She locked herself in the bathroom, and he banged on the door with his fists. You shall come out! Mother tried to mediate, but she was shocked, too: they hadnt expected this of his sister. Meanwhile, his brother grew his hair long, smoked cigarettes and dope, drank, had inappropriate girlfriends, and listened to evil music. But he did well in school and could beat Father at chess, which was not easy. Thomas saw clearly now how his father had failed to see things clearly then. He had failed to accept that his daughter was not going to do well at school and that his son was not going to be a staunch Christian. He had allowed these entirely ordinary developments to frustrate him beyond measure. He had castigated himself. He saw the failings as his own, because it was unthinkable that they could be Gods. Meanwhile, Thomas did well enough at school and toed the line at church. He was sent to a school some miles away, to keep him from his brothers evil influence. And his behavior was exemplary. Thomas did not smoke or listen to psychedelic music, and, when he swore, it was out of the earshot of parents and sister. Yet even Thomas was not quite what his father wanted. He preferred literature to the sciences, and Father was convinced that the truth lay in the sciences, the sciences and theology. Everything else was wishy-washy humanism. At church, Thomas was more obedient than fervent. He went to church only because he would feel guilty if he didnt. He would feel he had let his parents down. Of course, he would have preferred it himself if he had felt fervent about church. He would have liked to like his duties. It would have been such a relief. But, try as he might, he didnt. All this was in the air but never talked about. Father could hardly complain, because there was objectively nothing in Thomass behavior to complain about. Father could confront Thomass sister when she hid in the bathroom instead of going to school. He could confront Thomass brother when he was caught smoking at his bedroom window or when he started to paint pictures of naked women and said he wanted to go to art college. For better or for worse, there was a relationship there; there was heat. Father would bang on the bathroom door; he would shout. Sometimes he would even strike Thomass brother, then afterward hed be fearfully friendly, because he had overdone it. He would embrace him, and Thomass sister, too. But there was nothing he could shout at Thomas about. So, in a way, Thomas didnt have a relationship with his father, as the others did. Now that he thought about it, Thomas could not remember a single conversation with his father throughout his teens. Nothing. Not one exchange of any import or intimacy at all. When he had found that verse in the Bible, I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot, he knew the words were meant for him. His father was a hot man. His balding dome flamed with color when his anger got the better of him. His brother was a cool customer. Temper, temper, he needled their sister. But Thomas was neither. So then because thou art lukewarm, the Good Book said, I will spue thee out of my mouth. That was how God felt about it. Mr. Lukewarm, Thomas thought. I am Mr. Lukewarm. It was a Saturday evening now, and Thomas was alone, sitting at his computer screen. It had been a pleasant enough dayhe had gone swimming, shopping, had lunch with a friend. But now he began to feel anxious. Now he began to understand where all this was leading, these reflections that he had avoided for thirty years. The truth was that although he had talked to a lawyer about divorce, although he had got the documents, Thomas still hadnt quite done the deed. He saw that now. The thought of that final confrontation with his wife, the signing of the documents, pained him. You are marooned, Thomas told himself. Mothballed. For the depression. He thought again of that rainy Saturday morning when, short of breath and nauseated, his father had led his younger son in the awesome promise: With this ring... with this ring... I thee wed... I thee wed. First his fathers voice, then his own, as they stood face to face at the bottom of the chancel steps. With my body... with my body... I thee worship... I thee worship. It seemed to Thomas now that that must have been the most intimate moment they had ever known. In the name of the father... In the name of the father... and of the son... and of the son. How old had Father been that day, the day before his cancer was diagnosed, the day of the very last ceremony he would ever perform, not knowing it was the last? Fifty-nine. Dad had been fifty-nine. How old was Thomas now? Fifty-eight. Thomas was electrified. This was what he had come back to his father for. To ask himself what the mans life had been like in his fifties, when the family melodrama was over and the decisive battle lost. But easy does it. Put it all in order, Thomas thought, before jumping to conclusions. Go back. Back back back to adolescence. The siege was yesterday.Buy the print  The most memorable development that had to do with his father, the most decisive watershed, was the Charismatic Movement. His parents had at first resisted, then succumbed to the excitement. It must have been an evangelical version of the 68 aberration, the need for upheaval and change. Certainly there was an American influence. Soon Mother and Father were reading out I Corinthians 12 at every opportunity, St. Pauls account of the gifts of the spirit: there were words of wisdom, gifts of healing, gifts of prophecy. Then, one Sunday morning, the curate raised his arms on the chancel steps and spoke in tongues. It sounded babbled and weird, and the mans face was ecstatic. This was the baptism in the spirit. Needless to say, many parishioners were disgusted. Then Thomas had heard his father and his mother doing the same thing in their bedroom. Babbling. Then his father had declared in church that he believed in these giftsit was the Renewal they had all been praying forand he, too, had spoken in tongues from the chancel steps and raised his arms to Heaven in ecstasy when singing a hymn. Thomas couldnt remember now which hymn. All hymns at the time had seemed painful to him, laden with sad sentiment, with some sticky emotion that held you back. To sing a hymn was to struggle through warm mud, to feel the impossibility of ever growing up and being free. Very soon, the pressure on the children began. They, too, must be baptized in the spirit. They, too, must speak in tongues. It was never declared overtly, but it was obvious that if you werent, if you didnt, then you couldnt be part of the inner fellowship, the core family. His sister got there in no time at all. In no time at all, she was babbling away and praising God and talking about the Latter Days. It made school exams seem rather less important. Thomas fudged it, of course. Thomas pretended he was on board, but mostly studied for his O levels. His parents wouldnt want to stop him studying, would they? Thomas did try to see if he could speak in tongues; he might even have liked to, had it come naturally. With all the sincerity he could muster, he asked God for guidance and hazarded a few nonsense words; they were not convincing. Meanwhile, people noticed that he did not raise his hands during the hymns. He couldnt. All in all, it was getting harder and harder to keep your head down. Sitting at his computer screen now, Thomas saw that Father had embraced this heady Charismatic stuff to break a deadlock, to make something happen in his life. He hadnt been able to go to sea like his own father. He hadnt become a missionary in exotic lands. It was true that many souls had been won for Jesus, but then they had drifted away again. People blew hot and cold. The May Queen had been abolished, but no doubt she had returned after the reforming vicar had grown too depressed and disheartened to climb the pulpit stairs. There had been the new challenge in London, and he had risen to ithe had done well, the congregation had flourishedbut his daughter had failed at school, his older son was an atheist, a smoker, and a libertine, and his youngest child a mere conformist, a cowardly sail-trimmer. Father had written a book in those years, on the Holy Trinity, but it had not been accepted. Or, rather, it had been accepted, but only by some minor publisher, not the publisher hed wanted. It had not made an impression. Exactly what was in the book Thomas didnt know. His father hadnt talked about it, though Thomas was not so stupid, even in his mid-teens, that you couldnt talk to him about a book. So if Father hadnt talked about his book on the Holy Trinity it was because he was scared of exposing his ideas to his sons skepticism. Or maybe he didnt want to push this lukewarm lad into a position where he would have to declare himself. Either way, they hadnt spoken about it. They hadnt spoken about anything. Then suddenly this mad wave of enthusiasm was flowing through the church; there was talk of healing and the spiritual power to transform the world. Frustrated, Thomass father had gone for it. To prove the worth of a weapon you must use it. For six months, a year, the tension in the family soared. They all became more and more themselves. Violently, dangerously themselves. His father prayed and prophesied. His sister was a shrill echo. His brother made fun, hissing and sniggering like a demon. His mother wept; this unkindness would bring her down with gray hairs to her grave. In response, Thomas was intensely well behaved. He hid in his good behavior. In his room, he hung posters of football teams and tinkered with old valve radios. If he could have become invisible, he would. From downstairs came the sound of his sister banging out Onward, Christian Soldiers on the piano. Very soon, things would come to a head. In his small flat, Thomas had put on the kettle for tea. Now he changed his mind and poured himself a beer. He honestly couldnt recall the details, exactly how or why it had happened, but one evening, in the lounge, around midnight, they exorcised his brother. Thomas was fifteen. His brother had come home late. Perhaps smelling of dope or drink. From his bedroom, Thomas heard shouting and started to go downstairs. The lounge door was closed. A pale-green door. From behind it came shouts and the chants of prayers, the piano, a hymn. Yes, Lord, yes! And his brother was shouting, too. Leave me alone! Get your hands off me! Let me go! Youre all fucking crazy! Thomas stood on the stairs, looking at the pale-green paint on the door, listening. His whole family was in there. His father, his mother, his sister, his brother. The curate, too, by the sound of it. The loathsome curate with his ecstatic babble. They were all there, behind that door in that room, where a real drama was taking place. The drama between people who are hot and people who are cold. Thomas was outside. Thomas had not rushed down the last steps, burst into the room, and yelled at them to stop this nonsense. Thomas was young. He was afraid. He was excluded. He was not really on anyones side. He didnt want to be like his parents, but he didnt like the way his brother provoked them. Because thou art lukewarm I will spue thee out of my mouth. Was this, Thomas wondered, why he was on his own now, forty and more years later, on a Saturday night, bivouacked on a metaphorical mountainside, with no one beside him? Because he was lukewarm? And if it was, was it really a problem? Thomas rather liked his apartment, didnt he, and his quiet cold evenings. When the exorcism had failed, when Thomass brother wasnt purged or broken but continued to be who he had always been, when the desired transformation did not take place and life returned, if not to normal, then certainly to monotony and flatness, as when a flood withdraws after the tempest, what had his fathers life been like then? How had he been able to go on, to traverse day by day the grim domestic mudscape that was left? The nine sad mothballed years before the cancer choked him? A year after the exorcism, Thomas had gone on a last holiday with his parents, to Deal, on the south coast. This was where his father and mother had spent their honeymoon. They even got the same room in the same hotel, right on the seafront. But there wasnt much joy now. Thomas felt too old to holiday with his parents. His brother and sister were elsewhere. His parents seemed deflated, directionless, particularly his mother. They were going through the motions. They were trying to revive something. Father gritted his teeth. He suggested that he and Thomas rise early and take a swim before breakfast. It would be bracing. Thomas would have preferred to sleep late but didnt want to disappoint. So they got up at seven, put on their swimming trunks, crossed the road to the sea, laid their towels on the pebbles, and waded in. The days it rained, they put the towels in plastic bags. The sea was gray. Thomas could still see his fathers body, birdlike but paunchy. His skin was dead white, his old red trunks baggy and slack. When the waves came up to his thighs, he would stop for a while, moving his hands back and forth in the cold water, crouching a little after a wave passed to keep his wrists covered, standing on tiptoe when the next wave rose to keep it off his crotch. Wonderful air, he shouted to Thomas. So fresh. He made a theatre of puffing out his chest and breathing deeply, and when finally he ducked his head into the water he would come up sputtering and protesting and flapping his arms. It was the theatre of someone trying to turn grayness into fun, trying to find a reason to rejoice. Thomas was aware now that he hadnt been much help to his father. Hed launched into the first big wave and swum steadily out to sea. When hed stopped and turned, treading water, the Reverend Sanders had been a small bald figure in a vast expanse of gray. The years after that yielded nothing. Father started using aftershave and wearing colored shirts, even silk cravats. He looked quite the dandy. For Christmas, one gave him bath salts or body lotion. After lunch, he snoozed in an armchair, his trousers loosened. At dinner, he was as impatient as ever. He scraped the custard off his plate and hurried off to his sermons. That was the one time when he really came alive: preaching, persuading, seducing even, in his robes, from the pulpit. To Thomass brother, years on, Father had apologized. So his brother said. An awkward, hurried apology about the too much religion we drummed into you. And once, when Thomas came home late and was in the kitchen drinking coffee, his father had come down to pick at beef bones in the fridge and, with his mouth full, muttered, I suppose it has been all right, in the end, this monogamous life. Had that been an invitation to talk? Thomas drank another beer and emptied a pack of nuts into a dish. He closed the document on his computer screen. What sort of life could his father have lived if he had openly declared that he no longer believed, no longer wanted to preach, no longer wanted his marriage? It was unthinkable. Mother would have been destroyed. His sister, and perhaps his brother, too, in a way. Thomas went back in his mind to those morning swims at Deal. Now that he thought about it, there had been a kind of melancholy father-and-son intimacy about them. He remembered the pebbles dark with dew, their slippery hardness when he took his plastic sandals off a couple of yards from the water. Dad put his glasses in his sandals, so as to be sure where they were. What can you see without them? Thomas asked. The sea, Father said, laughing. The sky. After a warm bed, the water was icy about your ankles. The breeze was chill. The pebbles were painful underfoot. Father began his spluttering routine, then his slow, blind breaststroke. Thomas put his head down and dived. He swam strongly out toward the dark horizon. Stroke after stroke. A powerful freestyle. He was showing off, of course, declaring the vigor and victory of youth. At the same time, it had been a pleasure to have his father there, in the water behind him, between him and the shore. He had felt protected somehow. He remembered that. Now Thomas has swum out too far, and he stops and turns. He treads water, looking back at Englands coast, the long sweep of quaint, decaying faades, the pale clouds. The sea is all around, a slow gray swell. Dimly, he hears his fathers voice. Tommy! Tommy! Where is he? There. A wave rises and his fathers head with it. A small white dot. I can see him, Thomas thinks, but with his poor eyesight he cant see me. Tommy! Hey, Tommeee! Hes worried for me, Thomas realizes. Hes worried that Ive gone too far and may never make it back."

The last time I wrote about George Osborne, the international poster boy for austerity policies, he was celebrating a return to growth in the U.K. economy and declaring victory in his campaign to prove that Herbert Hoover and Andrew Mellon were right, after all. On Wednesday, Osborne, Britains Chancellor of the Exchequer and Second Lord of the Treasury, was back in the House of Commons, presenting his final annual policy review before the general election that is due to take place in May. Once again, he reasserted the age-old doctrine of fiscal rectitude. Indeed, he doubled down on it.  One thing you cant accuse Osborne of is trying to bribe voters. To be sure, he did unveil a couple of prelection giveaways, including a cut in the excise tax on most home purchases. If he hadnt pulled one or two Christmas presents out of his hat, his colleagues in the Conservative Party, which is currently trailing the opposition Labour Party in the polls, would have been justifiably outraged.But the main message of his presentation was that a Conservative victory in the coming election would be followed by even steeper cuts in government spending than the ones that he has introduced since taking over, in 2010. Mr Speaker, our long-term economic plan is working,Osborne declared in his Autumn Statement. Now Britain faces a choice:Do we squander the economic security we have gained  [o]r do we finish the job?  I say: we stay the course. Ill get to the claim that the Conservatives economic plan is working in a bit. But, first, what would staying the course entail? With an election in the offing, the Chancellor didnt get into the details of which programs would be cut. Instead, he merely reaffirmed his commitment to balance the budget by 2018, and, thereafter, to run a surplus. But the Office for Budget Responsibility (O.B.R.), Britains official fiscal watchdog, which has access to the governments detailed spending plans,filled in some of the blanks with its December Economic and Fiscal Outlook, also released on Wednesday. Setting aside a few protected areas, such as the National Health Service, Osborne isnt merely arresting the growth of government programs, which is what modest forms of austerity often amount to: hes cutting them back, often drastically. Between 2009-10 and 2019-20, spending on public services, administration and grants by central government is projected to fall from 21.2 per cent to 12.6 per cent of GDP and from 5,650 to 3,880 per head in 2014-15 prices, the Office for Budget Responsibility wrote. Thats a cut of about third, and it has been concentrated on some of the least affluent members of British society, such as welfare recipients, low-paid workers, and people who use public services like libraries and drop-in centers. And, far from slackening the pace of the cuts, Osborne is looking to step them up during the next parliament, if the Conservatives win. Indeed, according to the O.B.R., fully sixty per cent of Osbornes cuts are yet to come.  This isnt just budget-cutting: it is social engineering on a grand scale. The accompanying chart, which is taken from the O.B.R.sDecember outlook, tells the story.If the next government sticks to Osbornes strategy, the chart shows, over-all government spending as a percentage of G.D.P. would fall to 35.2 per cent in 2019. Thats the lowest figure since the nineteen thirtiesbefore the post-war establishment of the National Health Service and expansion of secondary education and social services; before the aging of the baby boomers, which will put a strain on public pensions;and before the major expansion of tertiary public education that took place in the nineteen-nineties. Ive longsaid that Osborne isnt merely, or even mainly, a deficit hawk. Hes a roll-back-the-government conservative who, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, spotted a historic opportunity to complete the work that Margaret Thatcher began. With the deficit soaring to ten per cent of G.D.P. as tax revenues collapsed, and with the spending policies of the Labour Party, which had governed since 1997, being widely blamed for what had happened, Osborne realized that the British public would be willing to accept deep cuts in spending and servicesespecially if they were targeted at welfare recipients, local government employees, and other folks routinely subjected to vilification in the Tory press.Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Osborne must surely have suspected that his spending cuts (and tax increases) would knock the economy back into a recession, which they duly did. But he was willing to take the gamble, and the political heat, in order to put Britain back on the path to smaller government that Thatcher had laid down. If the Conservatives get relected and the British public sanctions another five years of austerity, Osborne will be able to declare victory in his grand project. Even if the Conservatives lose, he has shifted the terms of public debate so far to the right that the next Labour government wont be in a position to abandon austerity policiesonly to moderate them. The Labour Partys leadership is desperate to show a skeptical public that it wouldnt lead Britain back to 2008-2009, and has promised to balance the books and deliver a surplus on the current budgetwhich includes day-to-day expenditures, such as welfare payments, but doesnt include capital projects, such as the construction of new roadsand falling debt during the next parliament. By boxing in Labour and delivering some of the types of spending cuts that American conservatives dream about imposing, Osborne has shown that he is, by far, the most significant figure in Britains coalition government. But that doesnt mean anybody should take at face value his claim thathis macroeconomic policies are working, to which Ill now return. On the plus side, the U.K.s gross domestic product has expanded by about three per cent in 2014, making it the fastest-growing economy in Europe. Osbornes critics, myself included, didnt foresee this rate of growth, and neither did the official forecasters. This time last year, the O.B.R. predicted growth of 2.4 per cent. But the recovery has to be balanced against what went before. After contracting by more than five per cent in 2009, G.D.P. grew at annual rate of less than 1.2 per cent in the four years from 2010 to 2013. Because growth has been so slow, tax revenues have barely risen, and the budget deficit has remained stubbornly high. For the 2014-2015 fiscal year, which ends next March, it will come in at 5.2 per cent of G.D.P., according to the O.B.R. In the United States, which kept its fiscal stimulus going longer and eased off it more gradually, the deficit is already down to 2.7 per cent of G.D.P., or roughly half the U.K.s level. While the experiment of employing two starkly different policies on either side of the Atlantic wasnt a controlled trial, and the external circumstances of the U.S. and the U.K. differed, the results were far from a vindication of austerity measures. Orthodoxi.e., Keynesianpolicies led to faster growth and a lower deficit. Among economists, a keen debate is taking place about why the British economy has been able to grow despite Osbornes austerity policies. Several factors appear to be important, starting with the fact that the economy had a lot of spare capacity and pent-up demand. Beginning last year, Britains consumers started to spend moreand save less. (In the past couple of years, the countrys personal-savings rate has dipped sharply.) It was this rise in consumer spending, which surprised almost everybody, that sparked the economic recovery. What prompted the upturn in shopping? Osborne and his colleagues would like you to believe that it was the confidence fairy at work: that, after three years of austerity, the British public decided that the governments policies were working and so, feeling more optimistic about the future, decided to go out and spend more. A more persuasive story is that Osborne, despite his ongoing commitment to austerity, managed to engineer a stimulus in the housing market, which got house pricesa key driving force in the modern British economyrising again. In his 2013 budget, Osborne launched a Help to Buy scheme, which enabled home buyers to borrow up to ninety-five per cent of the cost of a home, with the government guaranteeing their mortgages.In a country that has long been plagued by boom-and-bust cycles in real estate, this was a cynical move, but it was also a clever one. Because the governments financial commitment came in the form of loan guarantees, it didnt have much impact on the budget deficit, and so the Iron Chancellor could claim that he hadnt budged.And because mortgage rates were so lowless than two per cent, in some casesthe policy had a good chance of working. It did. By the end of last year, house prices were rising all across the country, and by this summer it was like old times, with the rate of inflation for houses hitting 12.4 per cent. Some of Osbornes supporters would have you believe that he has overturned the precepts of mainstream economics and proved that fiscal contractions can boost growth. Hes done no such thing. For the first three years after he took office, growth was dismal or non-existent. In the past couple years, he has shown that highly expansionary monetary policy, if it is combined with a concerted effort to ramp up house prices, can eventually offset some of the impacts of austerity policies. Thats an achievement of sorts, but not one hes keen to advertise.

The New Yorker,L,"Crisis in Mexico: Pena Nieto, and Mexico's Infrarrealistas","

 

The informal nationwide civic movement that has emerged in Mexico in response to the disappearance of forty-three students is propelled by people and groups with all kinds of agendas and ambitions.

This is the fourth part in Francisco Goldmans series on the recent upheaval in Mexico. He has also written The Disappearance of the Forty Three, Could Mexicos Missing Students Spark a Revolution?, and The Protests for the Missing Forty Three. In mid November, three caravans converged on Mexico City, led by family members of the forty-three students from the Ayotzinapa Normal School whose abduction, in late September, has led to nationwide protests. One caravan was coming directly from Guerrero State, where the students disappeared, another from the state of Chiapas, and another from the city of Atenco, in Mexico State, the site of the most notorious act of violent government repression committed by Enrique Pea Nieto, Mexicos current President, in 2006, when he was governor there. The plan was for the caravans to come together and for the travellers to lead a giant march on November 20th. The kidnapping is now known to have been carried about by the municipal police of Iguala, Guerrero, on orders from the citys mayor. According to the government, the police handed the students over to a local narco gang, which murdered them and burned their remains in the Cocula municipal dump. This scenario is still awaiting forensic confirmation, and the families of the missing students, and many others, do not accept it. They were taken alive, we want them back alive! remains one of the most common chants at the marches. It was the state! and Pea Out! are also staple slogans. As the caravans approached Mexico City, President Pea Nieto, along with members and supporters of his PRI government, began issuing statements and warnings that seemed to signal an aggressive new strategy to counter the protests. On November seventeenth, Beatriz Pags Rebollar, the countrys Secretary of Culture, published an editorial on the PRIs official website. The chain of protests and acts of vandalismperfectly well orchestratedreplicated in various parts of the country, demonstrate that the disappearances and probable extermination of the 43 normal-school students were part of a strategic trap aimed at Mexico, she wrote. All these activists and propagandists have the same modus operandi. Pags included opposition media on her list of these activists and propagandists, accusing them of fraudulently confusing Mexicans into believing that the students disappearance was a crime of state, as if the Mexican government gave the order to exterminate them. Two days later, Carlos Alazraki, a veteran PRI insider and an advertising executive who has worked on the election campaigns of several of the partys Presidential candidates,published an editorialentitled Open Letter to All Normal Mexicans (Like You) in the newspaperLa Razn. 46 days ago, two bands, students and Iguala narcos, got into a brawl, he wrote. There are varying versions of what happened. . . . That one [band] were guerrillas, the other narcos. One or the other wanted to run the whole region. Since the start of the narco war, in 2006, equating victims criminality with that of narcos has been a routine pro-government strategy. Such insinuations characterized many of PRI supporters early responses to the crime in Iguala. Alazraki closed, Dearcomemierdas. I curse the hour in which you were born. Youre murderers. You hate Mexico. And to finish, let me remind you that violence generates violence. Dont be shocked if the federal government responds. The day before, in Mexico State, President Pea Nieto said in a speech, There are protests that are not clear in their objectives. They appear to respond to an interest in causing destabilization, generating social disorder and, above all, in attacking the national project that weve been constructing. Just a few days before that, hed warned that the state is legitimately empowered to employ force to impose order. Pea Nieto often speaks like an actor playing a stereotypical President on a television show: talking about the legitimate use of force as though phrases like that have a magical power to insulate him from the squalid realities of authoritarian power brutally and lawlessly wielded, and of a government hopelessly compromised. (Jon Lee Anderson recently wrote about Pea Nieto.) When a President like that speaks of the legitimate use of power and describes protesters as threats to a national project, what people hear are threats to wield that power violently and arbitrarily. In the late afternoon hours of November 20th, people began to gather at various spots in Mexico City to meet the three Ayotzinapa caravans for the march that would converge in the Zcalo, the main plaza of Mexico City. That night, I went to the march with some friends and neighbors. By the monument El ngel, I saw an elderly woman holding a hand-drawn sign that read, Yes, Im afraid! I tremble, sweat, turn pale, but I march! For Ayotzi, for me, for you, for Mexico. As Ayotzinapa family members and students and other members of the Guerrero caravan were led to the front of the march, people chanted, Youre not alone. In the Ayotzinapa group was a young woman who held a swaddled baby and sobbing as she walked forward. There were machete-wielding peasant farmers from Atenco mounted on horseback. I saw many middle-class families, including children. Raucous contingents of university students joined too, of course. It seemed as if every imaginable group and sub-group, large and tiny, that exists in Mexico City was present. For a while, we marched between a contingent from a capoeira school and a marijuana-legalization group. I saw a nearly seven-foot-tall young man with long, blond hair, marching in the nude and holding up a sign that read Sweden is Watching. Many protesters shouted counts up to forty-three, followed by Justicia! #YaMeCans was scrawled on countless signs, followed by whatever that marcher had had enough of. For instance, #YaMeCans of the war against those of us raising our voices. The criminals are the politicians! Many chants were inventive or cheerfully obscene or sexual. The larger contingents, from universities and secondary schools, used rope barriers to cordon themselves off from infiltrators. People shouted at marchers wearing masks to uncover their faces. The masked marchers were presumed to be possible members of anarchist groups, or even provocateurs who would provide the police with a justification for responding with violence. Usually, the main significance of a march is simply that it took place: that people took the time to walk in protest or support of something, because it felt like the right outlet for their indignation or approval. But sometimes a march makes concrete a moment of collective cultural expression that can be harder to put into words. This march was an expression of Mexico Cityof a way its residents like to think of themselvesin full flower. But it was also a manifestation of a discernible change that seems to be taking place throughout Mexico. When a friend said that he could feel Mexico on the move at themarch,he didnt seem, to me, to be exaggerating. We didnt reach the Zcalo until about three hours after the first marchers. By then, the podium where the Ayotzinapa family members had addressed the rally was dark and empty, and I saw no sign of the giant effigy of Pea Nieto that had been set aflame, photos of which were featured, the next day, in media reports all around the world. As had occurred at the end of the previous march, a small group of anarchists (or perhaps government provocateurs) clustered in front of one door of the National Palace, apparently battling a line of armored riot police. From the distant, opposite end of the vast plaza, we could hear and see explosions and flashes, presumably from Molotov cocktails, perhaps also from tear-gas canisters fired by police. A dark mass of thousands still mulled in the Zcalo, many slowly moving toward the streets exiting the plaza. The reporter in me wanted to get a closer look at the conflagration, but the people I was with didnt want to go any nearer. I left them waiting, and Id walked perhaps fifty yards when I suddenly heard loud bangs and screams and sensed panic surging through the crowd. I turned around and walking back, as swiftly as I could, to where Id left my group. When I reached them, Nayeli, a twelve-year-old girl who is our upstairs neighbor, grabbed my hand. All around us, people were now running out of the plaza, faster and with growing panic. The situation was rife with all thedanger of becoming a stampede. We made our way through the darkened streets, navigating down the blocks that seemed emptiest, until we finally found a taxi. It wasnt until the next morning that I began learning about what had happened that night in the Zcalo and the surrounding streets, including those wed fled through. A large number of Mexico City police had suddenly emerged from the shadows on the Cathedral side of the Zcalo and charged the protesters. All around the plaza, they blocked off streets, trapping thousands inside a circle that, it turned out, wed just escaped. Eventually, eleven protesters were arrested, but many more were beaten, clubbed, and kicked. It seems that none of the eleven who were arrested were among those whod been attacking the palace, hurling Molotovs, or otherwise battling the police. Some were arrested while fleeing the plaza, and others in the streets around it. Witnesses used smart phones to film some of the arrests. Most of the arrested were university students. Most had begun to run from the Zcalo, like so many others in the crowd, swept up in the panic. A thirty-one-year-old named Liliana Garduo Ortega, who had been photographing the protest, fell down in the stampede. The next moment, police began clubbing her and kicking her in the head, and then arrested her. Hillary Anal Gonzlez Olgun, a twenty-two-year-old university student at the Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Mxico (UNAM), was also beaten and arrested after falling down. An art student named Atzn Andrade, twenty-nine, had become separated from his friends and was waiting for them by a flagpole when police grabbed him. Luis Carlos Pichardo, a fifty-five-year-old filmmaker, and Laurence Maxwell Ilaboca, forty-seven, a Chilean doing postgraduate studies in the Department of Philosophy and Letters at UNAM, were among the arrested. None of the eleven had any previous record. The Mexico City police turned them over to federal authorities, and they were formally accused of attempted homicide, criminal association, and rioting. They were then transferred to federal prisons in Veracruz and Nayart. According to their lawyers and human-rights groups, the eleven were beaten, tortured, and denied due process. Jos Alberto, a twenty-one-year-old merchant,didnt even knowthat there were going to be protests in the Zcalo that night when he arranged to meet his wife, Tamara, there. They became caught in the crowd that was charged by police. Both were beaten (his beating was especially bad) by at least ten police; he was taken to a police bus, beaten some more, and received ten or fifteen shocks, he said, from an electric prod, after which he lost consciousness. He was found lying unconscious in Corregidora Street in the early morning hours, and was then taken to a hospital. The day after the march, President Pea Nieto thanked Mexico Citys mayor, Miguel nhel Mancera, and his police for their coperation with federal authorities in upholding order in the Zcalo. A few days later, an old friend of mine, Paloma Daz, contacted me because one of the eleven, Atzn Andrade, is one of her students at La Esmeralda, the public national arts university. She drove me out to the campus, south of the city. Paloma and the schools director, Carla Rippey, whom Id never met, were close to the Chilean writer Roberto Bolao during the years he spent in Mexico City in his youth; probably there is nobody now living in the city who knew him better. Bolao wrote infatuatedinfrarrealista poems for a teen-aged Paloma;in Savage Detectives, Rippey is the inspiration for the character Catalina OHara, a beautiful United States-born artist living in Mexico. Bolao was a leftist who disdained the established left, its orthodoxies, politicians, and political parties. In the early nineteen-seventies, he led a group of poets who believed that life in Mexico and in the rest of Latin America was so violent and absurd that poets needed to subvert reality and realismas well as litist literary hierarchieseven more than the surrealists had. That attitude has been very much in the air since the Ayotzinapa incident. Indeed, inReforma earlier this week, the anthropologist and writer Roger Bartra, who is relatively conservative among Mexicos most prominent public intellectuals, christened the heterogeneous and radical protest movement that has unleashed massive marches in Mexico City as theinfrarrealistaleft. He chose that name, he writes, not pejoratively, but because this left seems to flow beneath political realities, carving tunnels to topple the government and undermining the cement of a system it considers corrupt and repressive, just as, he writes, Bolao and his compatriots sought to subvert a literary order they considered oppressive. Mexicos most lauded group of young journalist-writersa group (nominally led byDiego Osorno) who have stripped away the reportorial clichs of the narco war and brought its previously hidden human realities to readersalso refer to themselves asinfrarrealistajournalists. The protests over the missing Ayotzinapa students, Paloma told me, were the first in recent memory in whichstudents of the highly selective Esmeralda had fully participated. In the past, she said, postmodern ironies and theorizing have engaged them far more than political involvement. She added that it was amusing to see art students who have devoted their nascent careers to conceptual performance and technological videos struggle to paint posters and banners, many of them reading 43 + 11. Rippey said that the arrest of the easy-going Atzn Andradewho had been attending his first-ever protest march and who was being held in a federal prison on charges of attempted homicidehad driven home to the students that what had happened to him could happen to any of them. Rippey said that it was important, too, to temper her students passions. This is a free public university, she said, and that was a great accomplishment. There are things in Mexico to be grateful for. Frida Mendoza Chavez, a bright and energetic twenty-four-year-old student leader, told me, As a student at this school, I belong to a structure that the government created and that allows me to believe in a sense of community inside of it. Allowing us to have that place in society also provides us with critical criteria to support institutional legality. From here we have a right to say that we cant permit any more societal injustice, any more injustice toward humanity. But real reforms have to come from the trenches, where we know where we stand as a country. How can they come from the corridors of power? How can [the President] clean up anything when he himself is a product of corruption and impunity? Mendozas eloquent speech (That came out sounding good! she exclaimed happily) reflected what, to me at least, is one of the most important and overlooked aspects of this so-called Mexican moment. The informal nationwide civic movement that has emerged is, undoubtedly, infrarrealista in many ways; it is propelled by people and groups with all kinds of agendas and ambitions, including the most intransigent or irrational ones. But, from what Ive observed, it is incorrect to portray itas the governments supporters, and some eminent intellectual observers, doeither as a movement for radical or violent Communist revolution or else as an unfocussed mass of rabble-rousers who think that merely marching constitutes a movement. In recent days, a group of Mexican artistsreleased a videocalled Whats Happening in Mexico. Why We Say #YaMeCans, which powerfully condenses the causes and aims of the emerging movement. A written statement accompanying the video describes it as a response to the critical situation in which the lives of so many Mexicans have fallen, who have to deal every day with the impunity, impotence and danger that comes with living in a country that doesnt provide security, governed by a state that, far from preoccupying itself with imparting justice, colludes closely with organized crime and, on top of everything else, is determined to hide the truth of these facts. The artists suggest the creation of a Citizens Institute empowered to audit the state and begin creating the conditions that can bring justice to the citizens of Mexico. Nearly a year ago, in February, after Joaqun (El Chapo) Guzmn, the drug lord at the head of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, was captured, Edgardo Buscaglia, a Mexican security expert and senior research scholar at Columbia Law School, commented, El Chapo and his people in Sinaloa had hundreds of Mexican politicians in their pockets. Lets see if they arrest any of them now. Of course they havent. Buscaglia said that as long as the chains of complicity between politicians and narco lords werent interrupted, the narco war could be considered lost. The Ayotzinapa tragedy made those chains starkly clear. Meanwhile, the clearest example of corruption in Mexico at the moment seems to be President Pea Nieto himself. He cannot credibly explain how a relatively young civil servant from a middle-class family has managed to accumulate as much wealth as he has. The most publicized (though not the only) evidence of this wealth is the seven-million-dollar mansion that the President says belongs to his wife, a soap-opera star who hasnt worked since 2007. The title on the house is owned by a construction corporation that has won contracts (some of them controversial) from Pea Nietos administrations during both his governorship and his Presidency. Last week, when given an award by the Committee to Protect Journalists for his lifetime contribution to the freedom of the press, Jorge Ramos, the Univision broadcaster, spoke about Pea Nieto in a way that no broadcaster, and very few Mexican politicians, hasdared. Can you imagine what would happen here in the United States if a government contractor secretly financed the private home of Michelle Obama? Well . . . that is whats happening in Mexico and, believe it or not, theres not even one independent investigation being held to look into this matter, he said. Thats not saving Mexico. Thats corruption. On November 27th, Pea Nieto announced ten measures intended to pull Mexico out of its current crisis. He suggested disbanding the countrys municipal forces and uniting them under the control of state police. He suggested a national emergency telephone number. He revived the idea of strengthening the anti-corruption prosecutor. The proposals, however fell flat, and were mostly derided in Mexico and abroad. If state police are corrupt, tooand so are the federal policewhat good can it do to put them under the same command? As the popular radio host Sopitas commented, If first you dont effectively clean up corruption, uniting the police is the equivalent of institutionalizing the narco police. Others said that a national emergency number, because of organized-crime corruption, would only serve to alert narco groups of actions being taken against them. Pea Nietos measures admitted no culpability on his governments part, and no member of his cabinet was made to resign over the handling of the crisis. No concrete anti-corruption measures were taken against top-tier politicians. Then again, how can Pea Nieto take on government corruption and impunity when he has become the most obvious symbol of those ills? On Saturday, November 29th, a federal judge freed the eleven people arrested on November 20th, saying that there was absolutely no evidence to support the charges against them. It was a sharp rebuke to the government, and a victory for all those who had protested and denounced the arrests. On December 1st, the second anniversary of his Presidency, Pea Nieto was greeted by a poll that showedhis approval rating at thirty-nine per cent, the lowest for any Mexican President since 1995, following Mexicos disastrous peso devaluation. That night, there was another massive protest in the capital. To avoid the police trap provided by the geography of the Zcalo, the usual direction of the march was reversed, to proceed from the Zcalo to El ngel. It seemed that it would be easier for crowds to disperse from the multi-spoked traffic rotary surrounding the monument, with streets leading into a busy commercial and tourist zone. Violent anarchists, about thirty in number, showed up again, providing police with pretexts to attack non-violent bystanders. A smart-phonevideoshared on social media shows a police commander using violent language and ordering his men to grab anyone they see running. A number of people, including women, were beaten. Maps of the surrounding streets, marking in red areas that protestors heading home should avoid,circulated on Twitter. A crowd of about a hundred protesters was about to be engulfed by police when a group from the citys human-rights commission showed up and formed a human cordon to protect them. The protesters chanted against violence while the human-rights workers walked them to a subway station.

The New Yorker,L,Rohan Marleys Marijuana Venture,"

 


My father was the first entrepreneur in the family, Rohan Marley, the sixth of Bob Marleys eleven children, said the other day. He started his own record label, his own restaurant. He knew that, in order to give something back to the people, he had to create. You cant be no philanthropist, no Warren Buffett, unless you make something first. Rohan, who is forty-two, is also an entrepreneur. He has a leadership role in several of his familys businesses, including House of Marley (headphones, speakers), Zion Rootswear (T-shirts, onesies), and Marley Coffee. The familys newest venture, which will launch next year, is called Marley Natural. Its a particular plant, Rohan said, of the companys inventory. One that grows naturally next to the mango tree, the mint, the paprika. The Hindu sages speak of it. The rabbis speak of it. It is marijuana. Marley Natural is a partnership between the Marley estate and Privateer Holdings, a private equity firm shaping the future of the legal cannabis industry. (Privateer owns one of the largest providers of medical marijuana in Canada.) In a video on MarleyNatural.com, a camera rushes toward verdant mountains. He advocates for the positive power of the herb, a voice-over says. Bob Marley, in archival footage, flips his dreadlocks. The logo is a Lion of Judah between two green leaves. Rohan, who recently shaved his dreadlocks, wore a ruffled white shirt and a porkpie hat. He sat in the companys new office, on the Bowery. Around the table were Brendan Kennedy, the C.E.O. of Privateer, and James Estime, Marleys valet. Three Little Birds played on a House of Marley stereo. James, turn the music down, Rohan said. Estime, a burly man wearing a winter vest, picked up Marleys iPhone and lowered the volume. I got hot.Buy the print  Marley grew up in Jamaica, and moved to the U.S. at the age of twelve. He was a star linebacker at the University of Miami, even though he was shorter than most of his teammates, who included Ray Lewis and Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson. (Bobs boys, were not scared of tall mountains, Marley said.) Later, he toured with the Melody Makers, his siblings reggae band. I was practicing to become a drummer, Marley said. Unfortunately, at that time I was with a woman who thought my drumming was shit. She killed my spirit to be a musician. Her name is Lauryn Hill. They are no longer together. In 1999, he bought a coffee plantation in Jamaica. Meanwhile, Kennedy got an M.B.A. from Yale and worked for an affiliate of Silicon Valley Bank. My job was to study niche industries, Kennedy said. One day, I heard a pitch from a company in the medical-cannabis space, and I went, This is a forty-billion-dollar market, and no ones taking it seriously. He left the bank and started Privateer. Wed been approached by one million people about selling Bob Marley pipes, lighters, you name it, Marley said. The Marleys turned them all down, until Creative Artists Agency, which represents the family, set up a meeting with Privateer. When I met this guyhe gestured toward KennedyI knew: This is the man. Kennedy shrugged appreciatively. Were looking at four to six botanical strains, at first, Kennedy said. The quality of the herb is very important to us, Marley said. Marley Natural plans to sell smokable cannabis in countries where it is legalthe Netherlands, Uruguayand, perhaps, in Colorado, Washington State, Oregon, and Alaska. Well also offer a line of topical creams, Kennedy said. A Privateer employee interrupted with a bit of news: the Oxford English Dictionary had just named vape the word of the year. A plan was formed: a trip to a nearby vaping lounge, where e-cigarettes are sold and sampled. Marley Natural plans to carry smoking accessories, and Kennedy believes in market research. You guys go, Marley said. Its too cold for that shit. Eventually, he was persuaded. Estime helped him with his coat. At the Henley Vaporium, in Nolita, Marley sat at the e-cig bar and browsed a menu of flavorsPsychotherapy, Stop and Frisk, Cereal Killa. Justin Haber, the vapologist on duty, took apart an e-cigarette to show how it worked. Can you smoke anything you want out of that? Kennedy asked. Haber stiffened. Hypothetically, if you had the properwhy are you asking? Dont worry, brother, Marley said. Were starting a company, selling the herb aboveboard. Called Marley Natural. Im one of Bobs boys, you understand? Haber arched his brows. All legal? Hundred per cent, Marley said. In that case, fuck yeah, Haber said. A couple drops of hash oil in the tank, youre good to go. Just be carefulthat shit hits you like a Mack truck to the face. Marley laughed. Let me try that American Pie flavor, brother, he said."
The New Yorker,L,A New Deal for the Kurds - The New Yorker,"

For months, it seemed, the next new country to rise from the rubble of the Middle East was not the thing called the Islamic State, which wouldnt be likely to get a seat in the United Nations any time soon, but the region in northeastern Iraq called Kurdistan. Iraq, like Syria, was disintegrating, and the Kurds were only too happy to gather its pieces for themselves. But for nowand, in all likelihood, for many monthsKurdistans bid for independence is on hold. On Tuesday, Iraqs leaders announced an agreement to share the countrys oil revenues with the Kurds, resolving the differences that most immediately threatened to break up the country. The deal is a win-win for both sides, Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi Minister for Finance and also a senior Kurdish leader, said.  The announcement ended a high-stakes gambit by the Kurds, who, emboldened by vast discoveries of oil reserves in their region, were threatening to declare independence unless they got a larger share of oil revenues from Baghdad, which controls its own oil fields. Last March, hoping to break the Kurds, then Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki cut off the flow of government money to Kurdistan, leaving regional leaders unable to pay their civil servants and soldiers. Meanwhile, the Kurds began to unilaterally export their own oil, in a fly-by-night operation that sent their tankers, with satellite beacons switched off, searching the seas for buyers. The confrontation was years in the making. After the American invasion in 2003, leaders of the Kurdish minority (about seventeen per cent of the countrys population) began inviting foreign companies to search for oil. Soon after, the Kurds began making their own deals with those companies to extract oil and sell it abroad. Back in Baghdad, Iraqs leaders denounced the Kurdish moves; in fact, the language of the Iraqi constitution, ratified in 2005, is vague on the subject. As the rest of Iraq imploded,the Kurds left little doubt that their ultimate aim was to form their own country. You can hardly blame the Kurds for wanting out. Since Iraq was carved out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire, in 1920, their experience has been marked by invasion, repression, and mass murder, especially at the hands of Saddam Hussein. The Kurds still call the nineteen-eighties, when Saddams forces killed a hundred and eighty thousand Kurdish civilians, the War of Annihilation. In recent years, the Kurds sense of distance from the rest of Iraq has been increased by the disparity in their living conditions; while Baghdad burned, the Kurds enjoyed peace and a booming economy. We are talking about a culture of life, Fuad Hussein, a senior Kurdish leader, told me earlier this year. They are busy with a culture of death. Then came the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham. In June, fighters from the group swept out of the Syrian desert and into northern and western Iraq. At first, it looked as though the incursion would enable Kurdish independence. As the Iraqi Army (built at enormous American expense) collapsed before the ISIS onslaught, Kurdish leaders sent the peshmergathe Kurdish armyinto a wide swath of largely Kurdish-populated areas that were, until then, held by the government in Baghdad. Among the newly seized areas were the oil fields around Kirkuk, which greatly expanded Kurdish reserves. Over the summer, Masoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdish Regional Government, called on the Kurdish parliament to set a date for a referendum on the question of independence. We have international support for independence, Barzani told the parliament. And those who do not support us do not oppose us. That wasnt quite rightevery country in the region opposes a Kurdish statebut it didnt really matter. In July, everything changed again. Fighters from ISIS, who until then had only occupied Arab lands, began pushing into Kurdish areas. The vaunted peshmerga, which many people thought would crush ISIS, was embarrassed. Suddenly, the Kurds needed help. President Obama agreed to send weapons to the Kurds, but made it clear that he was opposed to their breaking away from Iraq. At the same time, the Kurds found that selling their own oil wasnt as easy as they had thought it would be.Many oil companies didnt want to buy it, for fear that the government in Baghdad would sue them. The Kurds were forced to sell their oil at bargain rates, which wasnt enough to cover the revenue lost to Baghdad. The Iraqi government had its own reasons for settling its differences with the Kurds. The main one, of course, was ISIS, which is occupying nearly a third of the country, including several towns on the outskirts of Baghdad. A deal became possible when the Iraqispushed by American officialsfinally dumped Maliki, the brutish and sectarian Prime Minister. In his place came Haider al-Abadi, who appears to be much more conciliatory. For now, then, peace between the Kurds and Baghdad prevails, and Iraq, the most artificial of states, holds together. What happens next? Maybe the Kurds will decide its easier to remain part of Iraq than to be a land-locked, oil-rich country surrounded by hostile neighbors. But the best bet is that the deal with Baghdad will last, at most, a few years. Then the Kurds will try again. For the Kurds, theres too much history to stay quiet for long.

"
The New Yorker,L,What the Eric Garner Grand Jury Didnt See - The New Yorker,"

 


Credit Photograph by Ron Haviv/VII								 


In a statement on Wednesday night, Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to tell New Yorkers that the official response to the death of Eric Garner had involved everything that they would wantsympathetic calls, public mourning, a retraining of the whole police force, so many reforms this yeareverything, that is, except criminal accountability for the officer who had held Garner in a chokehold in the moments before he died. Word had just come that a grand jury had decided not to indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, on any charge at all. De Blasio asked for calm and peaceful protests, and he did not try to defend the grand-jury decisionTodays outcome is one that many in our city did not wantand it would have been hard for him to do so. There was nothing mysterious about Garners death, and nothing just about it, either. Because of a cell-phone video, most of the city knew it, too.  The video was why, after de Blasio spoke, marchers took to the streets all over the city, with hundreds in Times Square. Videos have brought out crowds before; often, its because they show an injustice or an outrage. The Garner video had done that, but, in a way that now seems maddening, it had also promised justice. When Garners mother heard that it existed, she told Jonathan Blitzer, I said to myself, There is a God.  Having a video removed the ambiguities often inserted into accounts of confrontations between police officers and civilians. Anyone could see Garner talking to a clutch of uniformed and plainclothesmen in front of a store on Bay Street, in Staten Island, on July 17th. He said that they should stop harassing himthe question was whether he was selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. Garner was six feet three inches tall. He was also overweight, asthmatic, and outnumbered. The video shows that he did not move on the police. They moved on him. Pantaleos chokehold move is visible, and visibly at odds with the N.Y.P.D.s own regulations. Pantaleo adjusts his hold only to push Garners face to the pavementhe is now lying proneby which time Garner is saying the last words that he ever will: I cant breathe. Actually, these were his last words: I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. On Wednesday night, protesters were shouting those words across the city and printing them on signs. But, even on the day that Garner died, people yards away heard it (the video captures a man quoting Garner), and the police certainly did as well. When paramedics arrived, they stood around diffidently; the officers did not convey a sense of urgency about anything except getting bystanders to walk away. Garner was not a particularly healthy man, but an autopsy showed that the primary causes of death were compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by policethe exact actions caught on camera. He was forty-three and had six children. Staten Island makes Ferguson a lot harder to explain. What happens to the platitudes used to patiently instruct us about differing witness accounts and unanswerable questions, and all the solemn wishes that a camera had recorded the confrontation between Michael Brown, who was eighteen, and officer Darren Wilson? All that uncertainty was supposed to be why the Ferguson grand jury didnt come back with an indictment. A dispute over facts is often a reason to go to trial, not a reason to avoid itbut even so. None of that mistiness had settled over the events on Staten Island, and there were no charges there, either. And, if doubt is factored out, whats left? Many observers will notice that in both cases the officer was white, and the dead man was black. Maybe thats not it at all; but then New York needs to know why the grand jury turned away from what everyone else saw. The Garner case is so stark that politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand rushed to express support for a federal civil-rights investigation. Eric Holder, the Attorney General, said that there would be oneindependent, thorough, fair and expeditiousand also talked about how Garners death tested the sense of trust between the communities and the police. (The investigation should fall to the office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, who has been nominated to succeed Holder.) This is an American problem, President Obama said. As a matter of process, the route to the failure to indict is probably simple: the prosecutor who presented the case led the grand jurors that way. Thats how grand juries tend to work (and why criticisms of the outcome should not be taken as an attack on individual jurors); the bar for them to find probable cause to charge a person is low, unlessas transcripts show was the case in Fergusonprosecutors decide to raise it. Given the incarceration rates in this country, most people dont need a video tape to know that. The proceedings in Staten Island are still secret, but Pantaleos lawyer, Stuart London, told the Times that his client spoke to the grand jury for two hours. (Most potential defendants dont get that chance.) He wanted to get across to the grand jury that it was never his intention to injure or harm anyone, London said. Pantaleo repeated that sentiment in a statement on Wednesday, adding that he had become a police officer to protect people and that Garners death made him feel bad: My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss. A central issue in cases like this is a failure to fully value black lives. That alone can be deadly. But we should also ask about a companion problem, one that shows itself the most with regard to accountability: an over-weighting of white intentions. As any prosecutor knows, there are offenses on the books that dont turn on a will to murder, or crude racism, or even unkindness. Officer Pantaleo says that he didnt want to kill anyone; Officer Wilson was scared. Each of them might still have been charged with a crime.

The New Yorker,L,The Political Scene: Negotiating Climate Change - The New Yorker,"
 Focussing on a very narrow set of countries, as we did in Kyoto, and looking for aggressive emissions cuts in the short term doesnt do anything, Robert Stavins, the director of the environmental economics program at the Harvard Kennedy School,says about the international conference on climate change taking place in Lima this week. Stavins joinsthe New Yorker staff writer Elizabeth Kolbert and host Dorothy Wickenden on this weeks Political Scene podcast to talk about the conference, which is the first of its kind since the 2009 conference in Copenhagen.They also discuss the recent United States-China agreementto reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, the evolution of the Republican Partys pronouncements on environmental issues, and the fact that climate changeremainsa second-order issue to the American public.Of this, Kolbert says, While I really think we have to applaud the administration for saying, this is the best we can do in a bad situation, as a country we have to ask ourselves, Really, is this the best we can do?

"
The New Yorker,L,ISIS at the Border,"

Gaziantep, a city in southern Turkey some forty miles from the Syrian border, has become a bustling hub at the center of the Middle Easts latest conflict. Its a destination for spies and refugees, insurgent fighters and rebel leaders, foreign-aid workers and covert jihadistsall enmeshed in Syrias multisided war. I recently drove to one of Gazianteps upscale neighborhoods, an area of pastel apartment blocks with balconies, and took pictures of American Patriot-missile batteries on a nearby hillside. They were pointed at Syria. The missiles were deployed, last year, to defend against Scuds fired at rebel militias by the government of Bashar al-Assad. (Several Scuds had struck close to the border, and occasional artillery shells landed in Turkey.) Now the fighters of the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, a.k.a. ISIS or ISIL, are also just across the border, less than an hour away. During an inspection visit in October, NATOs Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, told American troops manning the missiles, Your mission is more important than ever. Until this summer, when ISIS began seizing large portions of Syria and Iraq, Gaziantepor Antep, as the locals call itwas best known for its baklava. The citys 1.5 million inhabitants have thrived as Turkeys economic boom during the past decade brought rapid development to the Anatolian hinterlands. The Forum Mall, which opened last year, has a Popeyes, an Arbys, a KFC, a McDonalds, a Burger King, and a Starbucks. In October, Fury, with Brad Pitt, played at the cinema. I watched a red Lamborghini as it roared down a wide boulevard. For years, Turkey maintained cordial relations with Syriathe shared border is five hundred miles longas part of a zero problems with neighbors policy. In 2008, President Recep Tayyip Erdoan, who was then Prime Minister, welcomed the vacationing Assad family at an Aegean resort. But not long after the Syrian uprising began, in 2011, Erdoan declared, It is not heroism to fight against your own people. He urged Assad to step down, for the welfare of your country, as well as the region. Since then, Turkey has done more than any other nation to harbor Syrias political and military opposition. Gaziantep is now home to the nascent Syrian Interim Government. Leaders of the Supreme Military Council and rebel commanders of the Free Syrian Army are regular visitors. The United Nations runs aid missions from Gaziantep, as do several other international organizations and a number of businesses. Gaziantep is particularly important to the United States. Washington closed its Embassy in Damascus in early 2012, and most American aid operations involving Syria are now directed from southern Turkey. The American effort includes three billion dollars in humanitarian assistance, such as food and medical aid, not only to refugees but also to Syrians inside the country. The United States has spent two hundred million dollars on everything from garbage trucks and ambulances to communications gear in order to prop up local councils struggling to provide essential services in rebel-held areas. An additional ninety million dollars has gone to equip armed opposition groups with nonlethal matriel, from trucks to ready-made meals. But there is no U.S. consulate, or even rented diplomatic office space, for American officials in Gaziantep, because of perceived dangers. For more than two years, Turkey allowed entry to thousands of foreigners, from dozens of countries, who ended up crossing the border to fight alongside the rebels. Young men disembarked at Gazianteps little airport and drove down the road to join the war. Some of them were Turks, including lawyers, students, merchants, even government employees. Earlier this year, though, after ISIS began attacking rebel groups and seizing Syrian territory that the rebels had liberated, the Turkish government clamped down; it claims to have deported a thousand would-be European jihadists and put six thousand others on a no-entry list. Even so, during the past two months, hundreds of menand a few womenhave reportedly crossed the frontier to join the jihadists. This summer, ISIS was widely believed to have penetrated Gaziantep. In October, police, in two separate raids in Gaziantep Province, seized twenty-nine suicide vests, three hundred and thirty pounds of C-4 explosives, grenades and other explosives, and Kalashnikovs. Americans in Gaziantep have been warned that ISIS operatives are tracking the activities of Westerners. U.S. officials remain in the city only a few days, or even a few hours, as they carry out their missions. A senior State Department official who was visiting the city told me that if he came under attack there his only option would be to hide under his hotel bed. This fall, U.S. officials came to Gaziantep to brief Americans working for nongovernment agencies. The advice was blunt: Keep a low profile. Dont gather in groups in public places. Dont wear sports or university insignia that would advertise nationality. Stay away from Starbucks. Gaziantep is a workaday city, not a cosmopolitan place, even though its prosperous, a young employee of an American contractor based there told me. Now its been thrust into this weird world spotlightas if Oklahoma City were suddenly on the front line of some international conflict. One morning in late October, I drove from Gaziantep to the border overlooking Kobani, a Syrian town that ISIS has besieged since mid-September. Until then, the place was known mainly for its Ottoman-era train station, as a stop on the Berlin-Baghdad railway. Local lore claims that its name comes from the Germans who built the railwayfrom Kompanie, for company, or Bahn, for train. The town that grew around the station, of some forty thousand inhabitants, attracted Armenian Christians escaping genocide in the early nineteen-hundreds, and, later, ethnic Kurds. Kobanis railway line became a boundary in the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, with which the British and the French secretly divvied up the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Eventually, Kobani was allocated to what would become the new state of Syria, and everything to the north went to Turkey. The borders on the map were arbitrary then, and ISIS is determined to destroy them now. By taking Kobani, it could extend its proclaimed Islamic Caliphate right up to the Turkish border. The siege of a once-obscure town didnt attract much attention until the United States launched its first air strikes, in late September, transforming what had been a footnote in the war into a test of American might against the jihadist onslaught.  On a rocky hilltop on the Turkish side of the border, photographers, journalists, and Syrian refugees often gather to watch as Kurdish fighters battle ISIS for control of the town, a few hundred yards below. I sat next to Hamid Muslim, an eighty-four-year-old Syrian Kurd. His cane lay beside him. The air around us was noisy with the buzz of warplanes, spy planes, and drones, mostly American, punctuated by bursts of automatic rifle fire and mortar explosions. Hamid pointed with his cane toward the western part of Kobani, where he had lived and run a vegetable shop. We closed the door and left everything behind, he said. He had come to see what was still standing. Other refugees passed around an old pair of binoculars to check on their homes. Many were simple cinder-block buildings. The fighting, often house to house, even room to room, had caused vast destruction. The first U.S. air strike of the day hit just before noon. We could feel its impact up on the hill. A charcoal-colored cloud mushroomed over the town. Hamid wasnt impressed. It doesnt seem like theyre really striking ISIS, he said. If they were, like thishe picked up a large rock and pounded it repeatedly against a stone on the groundthen ISIS wouldnt be there anymore. Theyre only hitting empty placesand not very often. There were four other air strikes on Kobani that day, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, as the U.S. effort is officially known. A communiqu from Central Command said, The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the terrorist groups ability to project power and conduct operations. The air strikes against Kobanimore than two hundred and ninety so farhave been costly: a Tomahawk cruise missile runs about $1.2 million, not including the fuel, crew, and deployment of two American warships in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea from which they are fired. U.S. warplanes have dropped munitions, including Hellfire missiles, at about a hundred thousand dollars apiece, and Small Diameter Bombs, at thirty thousand apiece. As for the warplanes, operating a B-1 bomber costs fifty-eight thousand dollars an hour. F-15E fighter bombers exceed thirty-nine thousand dollars an hour. And the new F-22 Raptor, used for the first time in combat against ISIS in Syria, costs three hundred and fifty million dollarsplus sixty-eight thousand dollars an hour in the air. Central Command reported that the five air strikes that day hit seven vehicles and one building occupied by ISIS. The air strikes were almost certainly hitting a lot of American matriel, too. ISISs artillery and tanksworth hundreds of millions of dollarswere seized from the Iraqi Army, after four of its divisions disintegrated, in June. By mid-November, the ISIS blitzkrieg against Kobani had stalled. John Allen, the retired four-star Marine general who is the diplomatic head of the U.S.-led coalition of sixty nations, told Milliyet, a Turkish newspaper, that the situation has largely stabilized in Kobani, and that ISIL will find that it is not going to be successful there. Unlike the Iraqi Army, the Kurds had mostly vintage arms, but they refused to cut and run. ISIS suffered heavy casualtiesreportedly more than six hundred fighters, with bodies left rotting on the ground for days. Its communications were also disrupted, its mobility restricted. A top State Department official predicted, Well get rid of ISIL sooner than people expect. Yet, as I could see from the hilltop, ISIS still held sections of the depopulated town. It outgunned the Kurdish militia. It adopted new tactics, too. With multimillion-dollar surveillance aircraft circling overhead, its fighters ignited piles of tires, spewing thick plumes of black smoke that obscured their movements. A black ISIS flag billowed in the wind atop a building in the heart of the town. Syria is the most complicated war in the Middle East in the last one hundred years, Anne Patterson, the Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Middle East policy, told me after she returned from Gaziantep. Later, in an e-mail, she added, The Syria crisis defies simple solutions. But we have an obligation, based on our national-security interests in the region and as leaders of the international community with humanitarian obligations, to help bring it to an end. The United States wants a friendly government in Syria. Although Syria has limited natural resources, it has long been at the Middle Easts strategic crossroads. Its borderswith Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israelgive it leverage that Damascus has been able to exploit for political purposes. Syrias ethnic and religious diversity also makes it vulnerable to exploitation by regional sectarian powers. An end to the war and a political transition in Damascus could have more of an impact in the Middle East than the ouster of Saddam Hussein or the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Hes a rescue.Buy the print  Syria, by itself, is not actually worth much, Steven Cook, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. But its been at the center of every strategic issue: the Arab-Israeli conflict; stability in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan; Irans influence; and Arab political unity. He went on, Since its own war started, Syria has become the vortex. The conflict has every pathology in the regionextremism, foreign fighters, proxy wars, great-power competition, sectarian violence. And now its sucking in everyone else on its borders. Syria has been the most divisive foreign-policy issue within the Obama Administration. During the Presidents first six years in office, he seemed determined to keep a low profile in the Middle East, fulfilling his campaign promises to end the U.S. occupation of Iraq and wind down the war in Afghanistan. In 2012, he resisted intense pressure from a powerful quartetSecretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the C.I.A. director David Petraeus, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempseyto provide arms and training to Syrian rebels. Disagreements over policy grew so deep that two top Syria specialists at the State Department quit. To me, it was obvious that that strategy wasnt working, Robert Ford, the most recent U.S. Ambassador to Syria, told me. He agreed to stay on through the acrimonious diplomatic talks in Geneva, last January and February, between Assad aides and the opposition. But then I could no longer defend the policy. It was beginning to stain my personal integrity.  As recently as August, the President was publicly skeptical of giving the rebels military assistance. With respect to Syria, he told the Times, the idea that arming the rebels would have made a crucial difference has always been a fantasy. This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards. Frederic C. Hof, a former State Department special adviser on Syria, who resigned in 2012, told me that Obama has seen Syria as the problem from hell. Theres no magic bullet, and there is no fairy dust, so he has just wanted this problem to disappear from his in-box. Obama had authorized humanitarian and nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition in the spring of 2012. Two dozen Americans are now part of the Syria Transition Assistance Response Team, or START. The program is operated primarily by teams rotating in and out of Gaziantep. A State Department official who has worked on aid programs in war zones and natural disasters told me, This is the toughest assignment Ive ever had. Were trying to provide help to brave Syrians to keep their communities running, but we cant go inside to make sure that its working. Were doing our best in very dangerous circumstances, sometimes remotely. More than two hundred thousand Syrians have been killed in the war. More than ten millionalmost half the populationhave fled the country or been forcibly displaced from their homes. More than half of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF. The scale of the human tragedy in Syria is among the most brutal of any conflict since the end of the Second World War, Raul Rosende, who is the deputy U.N. humanitarian-aid cordinator for Syria, told me. Turkey has taken in 1.6 million refugees, including three hundred thousand in Gaziantep; more cross the border every day. At the Arin Mirxan camp, near Kobani, I found more than three thousand people squeezed into four hundred gray tents. Kids, who were idling in dirt alleys, raced over to talk to me through the wire fence; theres little else to do. It was one of four new camps within a few miles of one another, established since the assault on Kobani. At least three million Syrian children are no longer in school. We fear this will be a lost generation, not only because they are not in school but because a lot of the new gangs will turn them into criminals or extremists, Fawaz Mahmoud, the Syrian Interim Governments deputy minister of education, told me. Its like the ground. Whatever you seed, you will grow. And the ground in Syria is horrible right now. For aid workers, the risks are extreme. Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig, a former Army Ranger who had served in Iraq, returned to the region in 2012, as an emergency medical technician, to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon. In mid-2013, he moved his aid organization, SERA, or Special Emergency Response and Assistance, to Gaziantep. On October 1, 2013, he was abducted by ISIS after he drove an ambulance packed with medical supplies across the border en route to Deir Ezzor, in eastern Syria. He was beheaded by ISIS last month. Two other aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning, both British, were beheaded earlier in the fall. The lone American still reportedly held by ISIS, a woman, is also an aid worker. American aid has produced ethicaldilemmas as well as risks. Aid earmarked for local councils had been going to four northern Syrian provincesRaqqa, Deir Ezzor, Aleppo, and Idlibwhere rebels had taken significant territory from Assads forces. This summer, however, ISIS seized much of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor. The losses sparked a debate in Washington, but the aid continued to flow in. The questions have been: Are we enabling ISIS? the senior State Department official told me. Are we giving them sufficient aid that they can use their money to buy more guillotines? And would we starve people without food aid? Its a tough conversation. It gives you a stomach ache. Around ten or fifteen per cent of the three million Syrians living in ISIS territory are surviving on international aid, according to Orhan Mohamad, the executive director of the Assistance Cordination Unit, run by the opposition and headquartered in Gaziantep. There is the humanitarian concept and the political conceptand they clash with each other, he said. If we send food baskets to this area, it helps ISIS politically. But if you judge it by humanitarian values it is keeping a family alive. So its guilty-guilty. It is the Devils choice. The fate of U.S. humanitarian aid to the Syrian opposition mirrors the loss of American military equipment to ISIS. As the jihadists swept through northeastern Syria, they seized fire trucks, garbage trucks, ambulances, generators, water tanks, and rescue equipment that had been provided to local councils. The Islamic States takeover also put an end to U.S. stipends to pay for local schoolteachers. We havent had a good day in a long time, the senior State Department official said. Administering aid from Gaziantep complicates accountability. Last December, Islamist fighters (not aligned with ISIS) seized warehouses in Atmeh, just inside Syria, containing a million dollars worth of American supplies. Washington suspended nonlethal aid to the rebels for six weeks. It also dismissed the Supreme Military Council as its chief conduit of aid to the rebels and selected its own group of a dozen or so Free Syrian Army commanders to channel the matriel. One day, I drove to the nearest border crossing, at Kilis. The line of eighteen-wheel semis waiting to pass through the big steel gates was five miles long. Most Turkish truckers, once they get across, transfer their goods to Syrian drivers. And then, as one Turkish driver put it, Who knows? The American government requires multiple forms of verification that the goods reach their intended recipientsvia G.P.S. devices, pictures from destinations, signed receipts, and third-party reports. But Mohamad estimated that only sixty to seventy per cent of international aid gets to intended recipients. The rest is lost to scams and schemes by warlords, gangs, criminals, truck drivers, and even the needy, who apply for aid from multiple groups and then set up little businesses to sell off the surplus. A lot of aid is being sold, both in regime-controlled and opposition-controlled areas, Assaad Al Achi, who works with the local cordination committees, told me. You see it all the time on the streets in Idlib and Aleppocanned food, flour, medical kits. Some still have logos from the World Food Program or Doctors Without Borders. U.S. officials downplay the problems, emphasizing the scope of need. That always happensstuff leaks out, people sell it, Patterson said. Look, you make a decision to give humanitarian aid, and on the broadest possible scale, and thats what weve done here, and we can debate that, but, fundamentally, thats what has been decidedto give it to anyone who is hungry.  Its a war, the senior State Department official said. If some of it leaks to other Syrians, its fine. I say, Dont overreact when something goes wrong. The premise of U.S. policy toward Syria is that the rebels need help in continuing to hold territory. The goal is to put sufficient pressure on Assad to eventually get him to meet the opposition at the negotiating table. No one believes there is a military solution to this problem, a senior Administration official told me. We want to rebalance the situation on the ground. Its not by making themthe rebelsmilitarily stronger, so that they can then march in and take over Damascus. We dont believe that is how the story will end. We just want to insure that the regime cant defeat the opposition. One evening in Gaziantep, as I was having coffee in the Divan Hotel, a new high-rise, the lobby began to overflow with burly men, their bodyguards, and Turkish secret police. More than two dozen rebel commanders of the Free Syrian Army had shown up, unannounced. Some were in silk suits. A paunchy commander-cum-sheikh wore a religious robe. Another commander wore a sweatsuit and a white Adidas cap; he held an iPhone tightly in his hand. They were all from Aleppo, Syrias largest city and commercial center before the war, and they had gathered for an emergency summit because of rising panic about Aleppos fate. Kobani is just one little point of Syria, but Aleppo is the economic center, Mohammed al Obeid, a captain in the Tawhid Brigade in Deir Ezzor, told me. Its sixty per cent of our revolution. If Aleppo is lost, it will be regarded as the biggest loss of the revolution. The main threat to Aleppo is not from isis. Syria is the battlefield of two related conflicts. The first pits the Assad regime against rebels who emerged from a domestic popular uprising in 2011. The second pits the original rebels against extremist rivals, many of them non-Syrians, as in Kobani. As the world focussed on ISISs advances, the Assad regime escalated its offensive against opposition forces around Aleppo. In the past three years, Assads security forces have used most of the arms in their arsenalmissiles and chemical weapons, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, even gunboats off the coast. They have also been using barrel bombs: do-it-yourself devices, which cost little and are made from oil drums, gas cylinders, or water tanks. Barrel bombs can be filled with all kinds of material: shrapnel fashioned from metal scraps, or nails and nuts and bolts, with chemicals, like chlorine, and nitrate fertilizer as an explosive to deliver payload. They are usually dropped on civilian areas from helicopters. They terrorize those they dont kill. Can I start you all off with my cheesy alimony saga?Buy the print  If Assads forces succeed in encircling Aleppo, cutting off access to the highway to Turkey, the city could be starved into submission, as has happened elsewhere. Abandoning Aleppo would mean condemning Syria to years of violence, the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post last month. It would mean the death of any political future. It would mean exporting Syrias chaos to its already vulnerable Iraqi, Lebanese and Jordanian neighbors. It would mean the breakup of the country to be delivered up to increasingly radicalized warlords. One of the commanders at the emergency summit in Gaziantep was Sheikh Tawfiq Shahabuddin, who heads the Nureddin Zengi Movement, named for a legendary Syrian ruler during the Crusades. A big man with a beard, Shahabuddin wore a red-and-white kaffiyeh and fingered a set of dark-red prayer beads. The situation is more dangerous than ever before in Aleppo, he told me. We want help from American airpower. We need themthe U.S. and its alliesto strike the strategic sites of the regime, not just ISIS. We asked Congress and nations in the coalition to create a no-fly zone. He added, Otherwise, our efforts are wasted. The Free Syrian Army, which maintains a logistics office in Gaziantep, is not so much an army as it is an often dysfunctional umbrella for an array of militias, each with its own loyalties and commanders. The militias are named for martyrs of an area (the Idlib Martyrs Brigade), historic figures (Nureddin Zengi), religious tenets (Tawhid, or the Oneness of God), or political goals (Hazm, or Steadfastness). The F.S.A. was the largest alliance of Syrian rebels, but it has been eclipsed by more radical Islamist factions, such as Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic Front. More than a thousand militias, insurgent groups, warlords, and armed gangs are currently competing on the overlapping battlefronts. Theres been a lot of switching teams, too, depending on pay, local victories, and access to arms and ammunition. At their peak, the rebels numbered more than a hundred thousand fighters, but only thirty to fifty thousand were affiliated with the F.S.A. The rebels have a strategy only in principle, with little operational cordination from town to town, and scant weaponry to defend against Assads airpower. Slowly, slowly, slowly, F.S.A. factions are being sucked into warlordism, Achi, of the local cordination committees, said. The main problem is that F.S.A. brigades were interested in liberating their village neighborhoods. But once they did that they sat and did nothing. They werent really interested in doing more. He went on, So groups, and even citizens, are becoming much more local about what is happening on their perimeter. Nationalism is completely dying. Youre going down to the smallest form of groupings. People now are going to their pre-civil-war identitiesethnic, sectarian, and so forth. The F.S.A. is outnumbered by Assads security forces and outgunned by ISIS, which has about fifteen thousand fighters in Syria and the enormous benefit of the captured U.S. weaponry. Before the war, the Syrian Army had three hundred thousand men and women, but its roster has been severely depleted by those who have deserted, defected, or been killed. Assad now relies primarily on his core National Defense Forces, comprising more than fifty thousand personnel; his Air Force; paramilitary thugs, known as shabiha, or apparitions; and thousands of fighters from Lebanons Hezbollah. The Pentagon, in an effort to build up allies on the ground, announced plans in September to train a new force of five thousand fighters with more sophisticated arms and tactics. The force is supposed to grow to fifteen thousand during the next three years. But the men have to be thoroughly vetted, so the program is not likely to begin until next year. The C.I.A. has been running its own covert operation to train Syrian rebels, with support from Gulf countries. The United States has coperated with Saudi Arabia to fund the training program, just as it did in the eighties to support the mujahideen anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan. The program has been personally brokered by the agencys director, John Brennan, a former station chief in Riyadh, who speaks Arabic and has made several trips to the Gulf to negotiate details. A few hundred rebels have been trained to operate TOW anti-tank missiles. The C.I.A. is reportedly training four hundred fighters each month in secret camps in Jordan and Qatar. Small groups returning to Syria have had some success in the south, around Deraa, where the uprising against Assad began, and in sabotage attempts against the regimes military. Haitham Afisi, the deputy chief of staff of the F.S.A., dismisses the new American efforts to aid the rebels. A colonel who defected after thirty years in Assads Air Force, he has met with several U.S. officials, including Senator John McCain. Its four or five months before they start, and then another four or five months to train, he said. The delay in the new force will allow the regime to advance. We face a real danger of losing the two provinces left, because now we are between ISIS and the regime, and they are gaining ground. So a lot of people will die. A lot of places will be destroyed. And there will be many more refugees this time. He paused. We have become just numbersnot people, he said. Numbers of dead. Syrias political opposition is also fragmented. The Syrian Opposition Coalition, which has more than a hundred members, sits in Istanbul, and is deeply divided, both politically and by regional sponsorship. (Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in particular, compete for influence.) Local-council activists accuse it of being out of touch with realities on the ground. The coalition, in turn, elects the Syrian Interim Government, whose Prime Minister and cabinet are headquartered in Gaziantep. This year, they moved into an elegant four-story building, with wraparound balconies, on a leafy boulevard. It looks like the Embassy of Switzerland! Bassam Al Kuwatli, a Canadian-Syrian who moved to Gaziantep to help the opposition, said to me. They should be working out of containers, like they do on gas and oil fields, and not wearing ties. People come from inside Syria, people who hardly have any food, and see all that luxury. Its costing them politically. The interim governments Prime Minister, Ahmad Tomeh, was first elected in September, 2013, and was dismissed, along with his cabinet, in July, 2014. He was relected in October, but only after Saudi-supported coalition members didnt vote. The coalition also brokers the Prime Ministers cabinet, which is currently a caretaker body and has involved nasty politicking among the factions. Each party wanted a piece of it, so theyve created a dysfunctional body, Assaad Al Achi told me. The minister of culture comes from a democratic background, and the minister of industry comes from the Muslim Brotherhood. They simply wont talk to each other. Tomeh is aligned with the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and with the Qataris, who gave sixty million dollars to keep the interim government functioning. In July, one of its senior officials absconded with ninety thousand dollars allocated for its justice ministry. The Syrian opposition has failed, time and time again, to deliver a sustainable form of leadership, Achi said. Prime Minister Tomeh, a former dentist and political prisoner, acknowledged as much when we met at his office. We as the opposition have made our mistakes, he said. We have not yet been able to learn the culture and very concept of democracy. One of the major illnesses that hit us after fifty years of dictatorship is that we lost the spirit of teamwork. I mentioned that people in his government are often criticized for sitting the war out in Gaziantep or Istanbul, rather than making their way back to Syria to govern in rebel-held areas. Oh, definitely our wish is to be inside Syria, but the security circumstances are very harsh, Tomeh said. We are always saying to the international community, Before you blame us about why were not in Syria, why dont you help us create a safe zone? The opposition has long pressed for a no-fly zone, several miles deep, in northern Syria. The Obama Administration has so far rejected the idea. It would mean a major military operation against the Assad regime, which could be long and costly, even after clearing out radar, command-and-control centers, and forward military positions. (Enforcing the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq after the first Gulf War cost the United States billions and, even after several years, did nothing to help the Iraqi opposition topple Saddam Hussein.) The U.S. has refused to directly fund the interim government until it establishes a presence inside Syria. What concerns Washington is that no consensus opposition leader has yet emerged who can replace Assad. Two generations of Assad rule have left Syrians without alternative leaders who can help guide them out of this terrible crisis, a senior U.S. official told me. There are no Nelson Mandelas, no Lech Walesas. One Friday, the beginning of the Muslim weekend, I went to the Original Aleppo Restaurant, a favorite hangout of Syrian refugees in Gaziantep. The pillars are painted pink; the tables are red plastic and chipped. A photograph of Abdullah Faris, the owners young son, was hanging on the wall. He was killed by a missile in Aleppo in 2012, as he was talking by cell phone with his father. The restaurant was filled with men between their late teens and their mid-thirties. Some had fought in Syria; only a few were fighting now. The revolution did a good job at first, but now everyone is fighting each other, Ahmed, a nineteen-year-old barber from Aleppo, said. He wore a brown leather jacket. As he talked, others gathered around. They all had tales of how a rebel militia had disintegrated or been corrupted. Factories in opposition-controlled areas were raided, the goods taken to resell. Businessmen were extorted, effectively paying ransoms up front to avoid being taken hostage. The F.S.A. has lost a lot of trust, Ahmed said. People who once supported it dont even know who the real F.S.A. is anymore. Many young Syrians who once took to the streets to protest Assads rule have lost the will to fight. The men complained that idealism was being replaced by disillusionment with profiteering warlords and petty politics. The big problem in Aleppo is not weapons, an opposition official who travels in and out of Syria from Gaziantep said. For the first time, we dont have enough fighters, because theyve left or died, or we werent able to recruit. There are enough weapons to liberate the whole city. But there are not enough men. I asked the men in the restaurant whom they now supported. No one, Ahmed replied. His friend Abdul Hamid Jamal, who had fought with the Tawhid Brigade in Aleppo, pulled up the sleeve of his hoodie and showed scars from where hed been shot in the elbow. Now hes among a growing number of part-time or occasional fighters. A lot of people have lost at least one member of the familytheyre tired of the war, he said, adding, Theyre less interested in fighting, because of the losses. That hurts the ability to fight either ISIS or the regime. I asked Ahmed how long he thought hed be in Turkey. Maybe forever, he said."

At 106th Street and Columbus Avenue, the crowds chant slipped from Jail killer cops! to Jail all cops! and it felt, for a moment, as though its anger was becoming unmoored. The disparate groups of protesters on the streets of Manhattan on Wednesday night, amounting to hundreds, largely remained raucous but peaceful, however, as they protested a grand jurys decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the N.Y.P.D. officer who, in July, placed Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold. Other groups of protesters assembled in Brooklyn and on Staten Island. According to the N.Y.P.D., eighty-three people had been arrested by Thursday morning.  The grand-jury decision was announced just after 2 P.M. on Wednesday. Soon after, protesters gathered in Union Square, and, as evening approached, word spread on Twitter of a plan to interrupt the Christmas-tree lighting at Rockefeller Plaza. The police responded by setting up barriers along Sixth Avenue, between Forty-eighth Street and Fifty-third Street. They blocked pedestrian traffic at some intersections, and allowed through only those with tickets to the tree lighting. Elsewhere, though, it was difficult to distinguish the holiday visitors from the protesters and the usual Midtown commuters and theatregoers. At Fiftieth Street, just across from Radio City Music Hall, about fifty protesters gathered around an older man with a gray beard and glasses. No more, he shouted into a megaphone, pausing for the crowd to respond in kind. Motherfucking business as usual! Throughout the night, protesters used the Peoples Mic, a call-and-response rhythm popularized by the Occupy Wall Street movement, in 2011. After a few rounds of the business-as-usual chant, a young blond woman yelled, Mic check! The crowd responded, Mic check, and waited to hear what she had to say. She started itemizing for whom they were there, and what they had gathered to protest.They were not only there for Garner and Michael Brown, whose assailant police officer was also not indicted in Ferguson, Missouri, she told themand, echoing her, they told each otherbut also for immigration reform. Seems like were protesting for everything, she yelled. As more people joined their circle, the group began to head west, on Fiftieth Street, and then turned north, up Seventh Avenue. Eric Garner, Mike Brown, shut the whole system down, some shouted, as what became closer to a hundred people walked around the cars trying to move south. Some drivers honked their horns in support of the march, and the pace of the group increased. Several rallying calls were shouted. Hands up! Dont shoot! Hey hey, ho ho, the racist cops have got to go! Black lives matter! Whose streets? Our streets! Nearing Columbus Circle, I asked one protester if the group had a destination in mind. I thought they were gonna turn down to Times Square, he told me. They might be going to Harlem. I know they did that before. North of Columbus Circle, more police officers converged, but they didnt stop the protesters. Many, it seemed, were simply watching. A few police cars drove alongside the protesters, who were now walking north on both sides of the median on Broadway, against traffic on one side and slowing cars on the other. When I asked officers what they thought about the protests, they all declined to comment. At Seventy-second Street, the crowd turned onto Amsterdam Avenue and continued north. I just wanna go home, a woman standing on the sidewalk said to no one. I dont wanna get shot by the fucking pigs, a protester fired back. The crowd, now well into the hundreds, snaked east to Columbus Avenue, and then north again. Despite the protesters efforts to evade police blockades, the police were always waiting for them. At Eighty-sixth Street, the protest group came to a near stop when officers began telling people to move onto the sidewalks. A young woman who had walked between barricades yelled, Im an adult! I can move where I want! Act like one, the cop retorted. The crowd, insistent on keeping north, headed for Central Park West, still shouting, Whose streets? Our streets! The marchers continued through the wealthy residential blocks of the Upper West Side and into the gentrifying streets of Harlem. With police cars at both the front and back of the crowdand racing from west to east to anticipate its movementit was no longer clear who was leading whom in this dance uptown. The crowd moved into poorer parts of Harlem, and past homeless people bundled up underneath the elevated train at 125th Street and Park Avenue. The block-and-a-half-long march turned east on 125th Street and came to a stop at Lexington Avenue, where dozens of protesters laid down in the intersection, performing a die-in. At around nine oclock, nearly two hours after leaving midtown, the crowd began to move south on Lexington. But then it turned right on 119th Street, toward Park Avenue, and stopped at the N.Y.P.D.s Twenty-fifth Precinct. On one side of the street, officers gazed out of their windows; on the other side, residents hung out of their windows, and some came down to join the crowd. A young man jumped on top of a car, waving a black flag that said, Anti-Fascist Action. Another man, talking into a megaphone, told the crowd about how, years ago, officers from this precinct beat up his stepson. The listeners booed. Soon, officers wearing riot helmets formed a line alongside the precinct building. Someone threw an opened water bottle at the officers, and it felt as though one side or the other might be on the verge of further provocation. The feeling didnt last long, and the crowd moved on, westward, under an almost full moon.

The New Yorker,L,Can Chris Rock Make the Leap to Leading Man?,"

 

Rock sees his new film as a last chance. If this doesnt work, I can definitely see no one letting me direct a movie again, he says.

In 1988, when Chris Rock had been doing standup comedy for four years, he took part in a special called Comedys Dirtiest Dozen. The producers idea was to gather together performers who were too shocking for the mainstream: Rocks co-stars included Tim Allen, who hadnt yet tamed his horny-Neanderthal act for television, and Bill Hicks, who presented antisocial rants as psychedelic parables. But even in this group Rocks youth and acerbity and race made him stand out; the m.c. introduced him as the Nat Turner of comedy. Rock was a high-school dropout who had recently become one of Eddie Murphys protgs. After the two men met in a comedy club, Murphy gave him a six-hundred-dollar bit part in Beverly Hills Cop II. Rock strode onstage looking much younger than his twenty-three years: a bucktoothed kid with a multicolored leather jacket, a Jheri-curled flattop, and state-of-the-art Air Jordan III sneakers. I was born a suspect, he said, looking at the audience as if expecting a fight: Came out my mothers stomach; anything that happened in a three-block radius, I was a suspect! White America is so scared of black teen-agers. I walk down the streets, women are grabbing hold of their Mace, everybodys tucking in their chains, people are hitting their car doors, people get into karate stances. I look up in the air, theres a bunch of old white ladies on the phonetheyll dial nine-one and just wait for me to do something.  His routine, barely six minutes long, was alternately rebellious and raunchythe highlight was an absurd story about masturbating to the image on a box of Aunt Jemima pancake mix. Rock ended with an impudent gesture that any hip-hop fan would have recognized: he tossed the microphone onto the stage and walked off. That performance helped earn him a place in the cast of Saturday Night Live, two years later, and that attitude helped make him the defining comic of the hip-hop generation. You can watch Eddie Murphy and go, This guy really loves R.&B. music, Rock says. You can watch Bill Cosby and its, like, This guy is jazz. If you watch me, its Ice Cube, Run-D.M.C. Rock is forty-nine now, and in the years since that early routine he has upgraded his hair (natural, neat) and his teeth (whiter, straighter), while downgrading his sneakershe likes cheap, plain black Chuck Taylors. Otherwise, he doesnt look much different from the way he did back then. He has the same scrawny body and the same trebly voice, an infectious instrument that sounds even better when gently distorted, guitarlike, by a P.A. system. The standup thing is a calling, he says. Every few years, he works up a new hour of material, takes it on tour, and then turns it into an HBO special, which wipes the slate cleanaccording to a prevailing comedians code, every joke you tell on television is one you can no longer tell onstage. He uses the time between tours to work on other projects, and to give himself a chance to start missing the presence of a microphone and a crowd. Part of me gets a little bored with standup sometimes, he says. Its like any kid: you get really good at a video gamewhats the next game? Buy the print  It was a Tuesday afternoon in Manhattan, and Rock had found his favorite table in the Mandarin Orientals Lobby Lounge, thirty-five floors above Central Park. He has been married since 1996 to Malaak Compton-Rock, a publicist turned philanthropist, and they have settled in New Jersey with their two daughters, who are never far from Rocks mind. On this day, the older one had to get from school to volleyball practice, and the younger one, home sick after an asthma attack, called to prescribe herself a Frappuccino, which he agreed to procure. Rock had spent most of the morning at his office, a few blocks away, working on his other career, the one that keeps him busy between standup tours. Almost from the start, Rock supplemented his comedy jobs with acting work; one of his first major roles came in 1991, with New Jack City, in which he played Pookie, a crack addict whose craving was so strong that it made his whole body vibrate. (This was not a comic role, at least in theory.) He has often been called upon to help make other peoples movies funnier, but with his new film, Top Five, for which he served as both writer and director, he gave himself the kind of role he has never had: the leading man in a movie strong enough to finally convince his fans that he is no longer just a standup. The notion that theres anything just about being a great comedian has irritated Rock for years. In 1997, talking with Eric Bogosian for the Times, he complained that standup was the lowest medium in all of show business, in levels of respect. No one ever suggests that a successful director branch out into standup comedy, so as not to be considered just a filmmaker. Still, Rock has never been satisfied with a life devoted purely to standup comedy, and Top Five is both an expression and a satire of the urge, common among professionally funny people, to be taken more seriously. Rock plays Andre Allen, a famous comedic actor trying in vain to create interest in his new film, Uprize, an earnest, misbegotten epic about the Haitian Revolution. One of Rocks inspirations was Stardust Memories, the 1980 Woody Allen movie, in which Allen played Sandy Bates, a comic director who was sick of comedy. Early on, Rock has Andre repurpose Sandy Batess best-known line. I dont feel funny, he moans, and he spends the rest of the moviewhich unfolds in New York, in the course of a dayexplaining himself to a Times reporter, played by Rosario Dawson, while simultaneously coming to his senses, or trying to. Top Five began quietly. Rock didnt tell many people that he was writing it, and he shot it independent of any studio; the cast was augmented by comedians he considers to be friends, a group that evidently includes nearly all of them. The movie had its premire at the Toronto International Film Festival, in September, where it inspired a standing ovation and, more important, an informal auction, which was won by Paramount. The studio reportedly paid twelve and a half million dollars for the rights to distribute Top Five, and promised to spend twenty million more promoting it, with some help from its star. In all this, Rocks partner was the powerful producer Scott Rudin, who has become his motivator and protector. Rudin likes to think of Top Five as a risky bet that paid off. This movie is a version of daring yourself, he said one afternoon, during a meeting with Rock. Because its not what has ever been your movie sweet spot. Rock laughed. I dont really have a movie sweet spot, he said. Rudin didnt quite agree. Part of the problem, as he saw it, was that Rock had indeed carved out a role for himself in Hollywood, but a limited one. Realistically, youve been in a lot of Adam Sandler movies, he said. Youve been that guy, and theres always a guy like that in the movie business, the reliable funny guy next to the guy at the center. But its not enough. No, Rock said. Its not enough. Rock wrote the script while on the set of one of those Adam Sandler movies, Grown Ups 2, the second installment of a somewhat lackadaisical and very profitable franchise. Im No. 3 on the call sheet: Sandler, Kevin James, and me, he said, then reconsidered. I might even have been fourbehind Salma Hayek, who played Sandlers wife. Which means I had so many days off. He was staying in a rented waterfront house, which he turned into a one-man writers retreat. Im literally looking at the ocean, like fuckin Hemingway, writing longhand, he said. Time spent on the set also gave Rock a chance to consider the successful career of Sandler, who has been one of his best friends since the nineteen-eighties, when they both worked at the Comic Strip, on the Upper East Side. He had the confidence of a black wide receiver, Rock said, admiringly. In the nineteen-nineties, Adam Sandler movie became not just a description but a genre, and an industry. Thats something I needed to learn from him, Rock said. He does his movie amazingly. O.K., whats a Chris Rock movie? One of Rocks many previous attempts to achieve film stardom was Down to Earth, a surprisingly wan 2001 reinterpretation of Heaven Can Wait, about an aspiring African-American comedian who dies and then returns to earth in the body of an old white millionaire. Near the end, when Rocks character finally gets his racial identity back, he tests it out by trying and failing to hail a cab. Im black again! he cries, exultant, as it speeds off. Im a black man! Thank God Im a black man! We ought to send PBS some money so it can afford better pledge-break specials.Buy the print  In one of the first scenes in Top Five, Rock updates and improves the joke. Black man, trying to get a cab in New York City, Andre says to Dawsons character, extending his arm, hoping to enlighten her about the realities of race in America. Just then, the punch line arrives, in the form of a taxi skidding to a stop. Rock knows that his films, unlike his standup routines, havent generally met with rapturous enthusiasm, although some of them might be described as cult classics. CB4 (1993), which he helped write and produce, was a low-budget hip-hop answer to This Is Spinal Tap, anchored by a series of loving pastiches. And Pootie Tang, a Rock production about a black superhero who speaks only in gibberish, became a kind of cultural touchstone partly because it was so energetically reviled upon its release, in 2001. (Pooties legend lives on in the hip-hop lyrics of Camron, Big Sean, and Kanye West.) But the first two films that Rock directed were neither big hits nor brave misses. In 2003, he re-imagined The Candidate as Head of State, playing an ingenuous Everyman who finds himself running for Presidentone of the last black President fantasies to arrive before real life intervened. And in 2007 he remade the beloved French film Chloe in the Afternoon as I Think I Love My Wife, a rather sour romantic comedy. Often, he has taken smaller roles in other peoples movies, cast on the correct assumption that audiences will be happy to see and hear him, even if he doesnt have a lot to do or say. As a standup, Rock is verbally brash but physically restrainedPeople like to see me composed, he saysand his stage movements are mainly limited to pacing, pointing, and squinting. In films, he can seem inert, as if, in the effort to shed his characteristic comic fervor, he has accidentally shed too much. As he wrote Top Five, Rock realized that he didnt have to create an entirely new persona: he could become a memorable protagonist by rewriting his own life, following the example of Woody Allen, his hero, and also of Louis C.K., the comedian who plays a comedian in his acclaimed anti-sitcom, Louie. (He and Rock are friends and frequent collaborators. Louis C.K. wrote and directed Pootie Tang and co-wrote I Think I Love My Wife.) In Top Five, Rock plays not an Everyman but a celebrity, often surrounded by an ambient chorus of passersby shouting Andre! or, worse, Hammy!, the name of a crime-fighting bear that has become his signature character. Naturally, Andre Allens guarded skepticism fades in the presence of a beautiful and tenacious journalist. As the interview evolves into a date, and then into a disaster, Andre becomes increasingly expressive, and Rock is increasingly called upon to act. In the course of filming, Rudin engaged the services of Larry Moss, a prominent coach, to help Rock stop being a directorand, for that matter, a comedianwhen he was on camera. Sometimes when people think, they hold their breath, Moss says. And hes a big thinker. So I kept saying, Breathe, Chris. Dont think. Stop and feel the floor. On set, whenever someone complimented Rocks performance in a scene he responded with cheerful self-deprecation: Just trying to stay in show business. Unlike Andre Allen, Rock doesnt have a signature character so popular that he never has to work again, although he does provide the voice of Marty, the zebra, in the three Madagascar films. He is a working comic who needs to keep working. Ive never made money like Eddie, he said. Ive done fine, but its dribs and drabs: two here, one there. I never got, like, a thirty-million-dollar check. I never had a movie make three hundred million dollars thats just starring me. So I dont necessarily do it for the moneybut Ive never had so much money I dont have to think about it. He sometimes describes Top Five as his last chance to get it right. It was, like, O.K., if this doesnt work I can definitely see no one letting me direct a movie again, he said. I had to think that was a possibility. I mean, how many times can you not have a hit? He searched for a suitable analogy. I used to go see Christian Slater movies, he said, shrugging. They dont really have them anymore. During a couple of hours in the hotel lounge, Rock was approached only once, by a young girl, evidently a tourist, who ran near enough to confirm that it was really him and then retreated. But, when he descended to Sixtieth Street, his life became a bit more like Andre Allens. He had to get back to New Jersey, and there was no sign of the Uber car hed ordered. Uber fuckin does this shit, he said, inspecting the map on his phone. There was a high school nearby, and teen-agers were streaming toward the subway. Yo, Chris Rock! one guy shouted. Say a joke for me or something, man! Buy the print  Every day, Rock muttered, without looking up from his phone. He approached a hotel doorman. Im going to Jersey, he said. Get me a car, Ill give him a hundred bucks. There were half a dozen idling town cars, but all of them already had assignments. Motherfucker! he said, to no one in particular. Finally, a yellow cab appeared, and after a brief negotiationcabbies arent typically eager to cross the Hudson RiverRock got in and the taxi drove off. In 1993, after three undistinguished years on Saturday Night Live, Rock left and joined its black-oriented rival, In Living Color, which was cancelled not long after he arrived. By then, the cutting edge of black comedy had moved to HBO, which had created a popular showcase for emerging African-American comedians called Def Comedy Jam. The series was helping to make new stars, like Steve Harvey and Chris Tucker, and Rock felt left out. I was, like, These are the new black comedians, and Im not a part of this shit? Fuck that. He got himself booked as a guest host, in the hope that, despite his years on Saturday Night Live, home of the white comedy lite, his young African-American fans would continue to think of him as their own. He still pays special attention to black audiences. Earlier this year, for instance, he hosted the BET Awards, a ceremony that is both less prestigious and, possibly as a consequence, more entertaining than the Oscars, which Rock hosted in 2005. Theres not a lot of black stars without a black following, he says. Youve got to have that bottom, or else youre just rudderless. Rock tends to shoot his comedy specials in front of predominantly black crowds, which gives him license to say things that might resonate differently in rooms full of white people. He recorded part of his dbut album at a black-owned comedy club in Atlanta, and one bit started with Rock looking around the room. Lotta weaves, he said. Whats up with that shit? There was an explosion of howling laughterhe scarcely needed to say more, though of course he did. A few years ago, he turned this observation into a wry documentary, Good Hair, about the art and science of caring for black womens hair. During an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show that featured the film, an African-American woman stood up to protest. When other races see the movie, theyre going to laughbut theyre laughing at us, she said. Youre telling everything about us. We just want to keep some secrets. Rocks defense was rooted in autobiography. He grew up in a working-class family in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the son of a New York Daily News delivery-truck driver, and from the age of seven he was bused to a school in Gerritsen Beach, a largely Irish-American and Italian-American neighborhood on the southern edge of Brooklyn. (Aint nothing scarier than poor white people, he once said.) He often talks about being bullied, an experience that taught him how to navigate a cultural divide, and also what a luxury it is not to have to. All the art I do is mostly black, he told the woman on Oprah.  Its for everybody, but it involves mostly black people, because Im black. And Adam Sandlers Jewish, and a lot of his stuff focusses on Jewish people. He sounded slightly, and uncharacteristically, rattled. I dont have a television camera or a movie theatre that only shows to black people, he said. If I did, I would. There have been times when Rock worried about being left behind. Not long after he departed S.N.L., he was shown up one night in Chicago by his opening act, Martin Lawrence, whose extraordinarily expressive storytelling inspired an outsized reaction in an audience that was supposed to be there for Rock. (He told Vanity Fair, It was like watching somebody fuck your wife with a bigger dick.) The critic and filmmaker Nelson George, who has worked with Rock for decades, remembers that era as one of reinvention. Rock knew that he excelled at writing jokes, but he resolved to get better at telling them, so he built a rehearsal space in his Brooklyn carriage house, with mirrors on the walls, to practice his physical performance. Everyone remarks on him stalking the stage, George says. That was a very conscious thing: How do I create more energy? Does flannel go with camo?Buy the print  When Rock remerged, he had a bolder, more theatrical style, and jokes that more precisely captured his point of view, which is broad-minded but skeptical. (Years after that night in Chicago, Lawrence saw Rock perform in California and paid him a very specific compliment: You got so many topics!) Rocks career began anew in 1996, with the release of a perfectly crafted hour-long HBO special called Bring the Pain, which includes perhaps the most startling riff in the history of American comedy. Theres, like, a civil war going on with black people, and theres two sides, he said. Theres black people. Theres niggas. And niggas have got to go. Every time black people want to have a good time, ignant-ass niggas fuck it up. What followed was a profane indictment, perfectly balanced between comic frustration and tragic anger. Niggas always want some credit for some shit theyre supposed to do, Rock said: A nigga will say some shit like I take care of my kids. Youre supposed to, you dumb motherfucker! What are you talking about? What are you bragging about? Kinda ignorant shit is that? I aint never been to jail! What you want, a cookie? Youre not supposed to go to jail, you low-expectation-having motherfucker!  All this was palatable, if you found it palatable (and some didnt), because Rock declined to present it as anything more than the splenetic observation of a guy who was a little older and a lot richer than he used to bea guy, you suspected, who saw his relatives, and maybe even himself, reflected on both sides of that civil war. An intemperate rebuke about shiftless niggas sounded much more ambiguous, and much funnier, coming from the so-called Nat Turner of comedy. The black people vs. niggas routine established Rock not just as a great comedian, which is indisputable, but as a potential political spokesman, a role he has rejected ever since. Youve never seen me on a political show, he says. Youve never seen me talk about an issue. But he knows that part of what audiences love about him is his willingness to tell unpopular truths; where more confessional comedians reveal secrets about their lives, he aims to reveal secrets about ours. This means that his act requires a steady supply of unpopular truths to tell, and finding them can take a while. You get to a point where its, like, Ive said everything, he says. You want the world to change, and you want to changeyou dont want to be the same guy. It has been six years since Rocks last special, Kill the Messenger, and so, even while finishing Top Five, he has been making occasional forays to comedy clubs to work on his new set. On a recent Friday night, Rock turned up at the Comedy Cellar, in Greenwich Village, where Estee Adoram, the clubs longtime booker, is always happy to squeeze him into the schedule. Colin Quinn, a friend from the early days, was there, having just performed. Good shit, man, Rock said, and asked Quinn about his girlfriend. You going to marry her? Aw, leave me alone, Quinn said, fondly, before making an escape. Rock installed himself at a table marked Reserved in the restaurant, upstairs, and ordered some French fries, a Coke, and a chocolate milkshake. He had with him some sheets of cardboardthe remnants of notebooks whose pages had long ago been ripped outcovered with brief phrases. This is how he writes down his routines, using a technique borrowed from his paternal grandfather, who was a cabdriver during the week and a preacher on the weekends; the idea is to always be talking, instead of reading. He managed to eat a few fries before Adoram gave him a cue, and he hopped down a narrow staircase in the back just in time to hear the m.c. say his name, and to hear the audience react with stunned jubilation. Its not going to be that goodnot at these prices, he said, when he got to the low stage. (Admission was twenty-four dollars, plus a minimum of two items from the menu.) At these prices, I could leave right now! He imagined the reviews: Chris Rock came out and he leftit was good! He didnt tell any jokes, but it was good! When Rock goes on tour, he is conscious of giving the audience a show: a sharp suit, a crisp set, a ferocious attitude. But on nights like this, when he is testing out material, he changes his body language in an attempt to create the conditions for a clinical trial: he wants to find out which jokes work even when hes not selling them. He slumps against the back wall, fidgets with the microphone stand, pauses to examine his paperless notebooks. Its a gym, he likes to saya place to work out, not to show off. He looked out at the crowd, speaking mainly to himself: What am I going to talk about? January 31, 2011What about Businesswhich branch is that?Buy the print  There was plenty: a long bit about religion and a short one about bullying, and also a withering take on the alleged coolness of President Obama. Obamas, like, cool compared to other politiciansbut not as cool as actual cool people, he said. Like, Miles Davis would kick Obama in the fuckin teeth! Someone suggested that he say something about the new iPhone, but Rock preferred to consider Ray Rice and Chris Brown, two of the many celebrities who have been caught behaving badly in the years since Rock last toured. People say theres no reason to ever hit a woman, he said. Notheres no reason to ever hit a woman first. You can hit a woman backshit, if Oprah hit me Id knock her the fuck out! The absurd image gave the crowd permission to laugh at an idea that it didnt necessarily endorse, and Rock pressed on, recalling the media coverage of Browns assault on Rihanna, who was then his girlfriend. No one ever asked the question Who hit first? he said. Best journalists in the world, not one asked the question. Its not important. Yes, it is! Its the most important question on earth. The laughter was dying down. The United States bombed fuckin Japan, he said. We killed so many peoplelike, twelve 9/11s on one day. Because they hit first, he said. Were bombing up Syriathey cut off two peoples heads! His voice was getting higher and more insistenthe sounded about seventy per cent earnest. Were going to kill hundreds of thousands of people! And its O.K.! He got quiet, and the laughter returned, as the audience warmed to the punch line: Because they hit first. After about fifteen minutes onstage, he walked through the crowd and upstairs to his table, where a waiter brought back his half-eaten French fries and half-finished milkshake. Theres no rich way to do standup, he said. Youve got to go to the same club you started at, be around the same bunch of guys you knew twenty-five years ago. Youre going to go onstage, and theyre either going to laugh or theyre not. Theyll give you about six minutes because youre famous. And then youre back to square one. As much as possible, Rock movesthrough the city as if he were not famous. The average guy thats been in as many movies as I have been inand is black, or whateverwould have three people outside that door, he said, one afternoon, after arriving unaccompanied for a meeting. The driver downstairs would have a walkie-talkie, and they would correspond: O.K., were moving him downstairs. No disrespect to anybody, but my heroes were different. Woody Allen doesnt walk around with a bunch of random people, you know what I mean? Rock doesnt think of himself as unusually funny. Im not the funniest person I know, he says. Im not the tenth-funniest person I know. I wasnt the funniest guy on my block. I wasnt the funniest guy in the clubs. To compensate, he says, he had to outwork everyone else. My nickname for him is the Duke of Doubt, Nelson George says. Hes not someone who revels in his successes. Hes already contemplating the next argument, the next thing that could go wrong. For many people who knew Rock, his underwhelming film career was something of a running joke. George remembers that filmmaker friends of his used to say, We love Chris, but he really shouldnt direct anymore. The comic and writer Neal Brennan, the co-creator of Chappelles Show, has known Rock for more than a decade, and served as a consultant on Top Five. He says that for years he was puzzled by the disjunction between Rocks meticulously written standup sets and his seemingly tossed-off movieseverything he wrote, produced, or directed had been, essentially, a high-concept remake. He likes being blue-collar: he likes that his dad was blue-collar, and he brought that blue-collar ethic to standup, Brennan says. But he never brought that blue-collar ethic to movies. This is the first time. And he did ithell hate me for saying thisbecause Scott Rudin made him. Rudin and Rock became close four years ago, after Rudin approached him with what sounded like a bad idea: to play a lead role in a new play called The Motherfucker with the Hat, by Stephen Adly Guirgis, which would make its dbut on Broadway. It read like something hed written, Rudin says. You read it, you couldnt help hearing the words come from his mouth. Rocks character, Ralph, was a recovering alcoholic, a seeming beacon of good sense who slowly reveals himself to be a cold-blooded opportunist. The director, Anna D. Shapiro, hesitated to cast Rock, but was worn down first by Rudins enthusiasm and then by Rocks willingness to audition, and by his commitment to developing a different kind of stage presence. Chris is used to making eye contact with the audience, Shapiro says. The audience shifts and changes, and he rides that. In rehearsal, she sometimes had to admonish him for looking at herhe needed to learn to resist his habit of reading the room. June 23, 2008You may approach the giant novelty chair.Buy the print  It was a difficult productionGuirgis kept rewriting all the way through the previewsbut the critical notice, during the plays four-month run, was mainly kind. For Rock, the experience was transformative: he was impressed by Guirgiss ability to write new lines every day, and by his own ability to learn them and then deliver them only a few hours later. (As a standup, Rock typically doesnt say anything in a theatre that he hasnt already said, hundreds of times, in a small club.) The play helped him realize that a dramatic project could be as difficult, and as rewarding, as standup. I think when Chris came to do Motherfucker he was sleepwalking, a little bit, in his life, Shapiro says. By the time the play was finished, Rock was ready to work just as hard on a film.  Rudin says, Id always thought Chris was a good director. I didnt always agree with the choice of material. For Top Five, he urged Rock to present himself as a star. Dont make yourself a nerdy guy in glasses, he said. (In I Think I Love My Wife, Rock played the investment banker Richard Coopera nerdy guy in glasses.) Rudins hope was to recapture the rebellious spirit of Rocks early standup routines. He said, What can we do thats as fuck-off as who you were then? Whats the forty-nine-year-old version of dropping the mike? In Top Five, as in the previous movies Rock has directed, his character is choosing between two women: a thoughtful journalist, played by Dawson, and a reality star, played by Gabrielle Union. It is in some ways a kindhearted story, but Unions characterglamorous and unsentimentalcould be the subject of one of Rocks less sparing routines about women. I dont have a talent, Union laments, at one point, and its not entirely clear whether were meant to pity her, laugh at her, or both. Near the end of Top Five, Andre Allen makes his way to the Comedy Cellar, and the character and the actor become indistinguishable. Rock used to save his best jokes for his standupin Down to Earth, he played a struggling comedian whose material, unfortunately, made his situation seem quite believable. He says, This is the first movie I just said, Fuck itIll write other standup jokes. Shapiro, the theatre director, saw an early draft, and she remembers Rock asking if she had any suggestions. I said, Yeah, can you take out the stupid jokes about gay people? Or the stupid jokes about fat people? And he was, like, Nobut Ill take a look at them. The jokes stayed in, and at a recent preview screening they earned roaring responses. One Friday morning, in the modest theatre-district offices that house Rudins production company, the two partners were preparing for a conference call with the marketing department of Paramount. The night before, at a thirtieth-anniversary concert for Def Jam, the hip-hop record label, in Brooklyn, Gabrielle Union had introduced the dbut screening of the films trailer. She got the title of the movie wrong, Rudin said, chucklingshe had called it Top Ten. Like many producers, he is typically disinclined to receive bad news calmly, but on this day he seemed more like a cheerful fan, happy to share a couch with his favorite comedian. She was great, though, Rudin said. She was really charming. Rock looked up. You went? He liked the image of Rudin in Brooklyn, watching 2 Chainz. A decade or two ago, Rock surely would have been there, instead of spending another quiet night at home in New Jersey. I got video, Rudin said, regretfully. I had ticketsI couldnt get out of here.  Rudin was reprising the role of motivator. I think he has to go back and make another movie, he said. Not in four yearsanother movie should be out in two years, two and a half years. Rudin even made the impending marketing call sound like proof of Rocks arrival as a legitimate movie star. Hes going to walk into this room, theres going to be forty people on the other end of this teleconference that are all there for him, Rudin said, and then he looked at Rock. Thats a big moment in your life, he said. Theyre here for you. Youre not part of someone elses movie. This is your thing. Rock laughed. Im Sandler! Exactly! Rudin said. September 24, 2012Wait! Everythings going to be okaytheyre having an election!Buy the print  Rock is closer in spirit to Woody Allen, whom he once called the greatest comic mind since Chaplin. But what he discovered was that he could make an Allen-inspired moviesmall, self-conscious, profoundly New Yorkishwithout muting his other interests. In a weird way, this is the blackest movie Ive ever done, he says. Its really black. Its blue-black. One extended scene, set in an apartment in the projects, is essentially an excuse to fill a room with African-American comedians, including Tracy Morgan, whose patter contains an unfootnoted allusion to a speech that Suge Knight delivered at the 1995 Source Awards. The film refuses to stop and explain its many hip-hop references. (The title refers to the characters habit of asking one another to name their favorite rappers.) During that convivial apartment scene, Andre swaps jokes and pronouncements with old friends and relatives, speculating about what Tupac Shakur would be up to if he were still alive. When someone says that Shakur would be a political leader, Andre turns skeptical. Tupac might be in a Tyler Perry movie right nowyou dont know! he says. Tupac might be the bad, dark-skinned boyfriend in a Tyler Perry movie. I would hope hes a senator. But he might be kicking Jill Scott down a flight of stairs. In another scene, Andre sums up the movies split personality by granting Charlie Chaplin an honorary place in his hip-hop pantheon, calling him the KRS-One of comedy. Louis C.K. thinks that the solution to Rocks movie problem was obvious in retrospect. His honesty and thoughtfulness and intelligenceit isnt a good match for just putting a guy up there, building a big premise around him, and raking in the bucks, he says. Chris was trying to figure out the formula to make a movie, but all he really needed to do was be who he is onstage. By writing a movie inspired by his own life, Rock found a way to put his disparate obsessions onscreen, depicting a world in which Woody Allen is no less or more important than Tupac Shakur. Rudin describes Top Five as half a Richard Linklater movie and half a Robin Harris concert film, though he surely hopes that it will appeal to viewers who have never seen Waking Life, or who have never heard of Harris, a stubbornly non-mainstream black comedian, who died in 1990. The movie succeeds as a hybrid, both moodier and bawdier than anything else Rock has done onscreen. Rock said, Even if the movie doesnt make a dime, Ive figured out the tone of movie I should be in. In fact, Rock is already thinking about the next movie that he wants to direct, although it has less in common with Top Five than with Uprize, Andres disastrous movie-within-a-movie about the Haitian Revolution. Rock has been reading about Nat Turner, and he believes the time might be right for a bio-pic that tells Turners story in all its complexity. Nat Turners a fucking nerd, Rock said, with admiration. He gets taught to read and write by his white massa, and he gets sold, and now he has to go out in the fields like everybody else, and hes so not equipped for this shit. He liked the idea of Turner as a snob who became a revolutionary only after getting the snobbery beat out of him. Nat Turner had the worst attitude, he said. He was worse than the white guys! Then he gets put out there. Its, like, Oh, shit! Everything Ive been taught is bullshit! And he organizes guys and has this bloody fuckin takeover. Rock had an onstage gleam in his eyes. Id love to do that movie, he said."

Hans Ulrich Obrist has conducted twenty-four hundred hours of interviews with creative people: salons of the twenty-first century.

Hans Ulrich Obrist is a curator at the Serpentine, a gallery in Londons Kensington Gardens that was once a teahouse and is now firmly established as a center for contemporary art. A few years ago, ArtReview named him the most powerful figure in the field, but Obrist, a forty-six-year-old Swiss, seems less to stand atop the art world than to race around, up, over, and through it. On weekdays, he works at the Serpentine offices; there are meetings over budgets and fund-raising, and Obrist, with his fellow-director, Julia Peyton-Jones, selects artists to exhibit and helps them shape their shows. When I visited him in London in late August, two exhibitions that he had organized were up: 512 hours, a durational performance piece by Marina Abramovi, and a show of computer-generated video art by Ed Atkins. But on weekends Obrist becomes who he truly is: a traveller. By his count, he has made roughly two thousand trips in the past twenty years, and while in London I discovered that he had been away fifty of the previous fifty-two weekends. He goes to meet emerging artists and check in with old ones, to see shows small and large. The kind of culture he cares about is mobile and far-flung and can be grasped better on the move. He likes to quote J.G. Ballards claim that the most beautiful building in London is the Hilton Hotel at Heathrow Airport, and the postcolonial scholar Homi Bhabhas observation that in-betweenness is a fundamental condition of our times. Obrist is enormously fond of quoting. On the twelve weekends before I saw him in London, H.U.O., as Obrist is known, had been in Basel, for the art fair; Ronchamp, France, for a wedding, in the chapel designed by Le Corbusier; Munich, for a talk with Matthew Barney; Berlin, where he maintains an apartment primarily to house ten thousand books, for an interview with Rosemarie Trockel; Frankfurt, for a panel with Peter Fischli; Arles, where he is helping to design a new museum; Singapore, to meet emerging artists; Munich again, to interview the young Estonian artist Katja Novitskova; Los Angeles, for a panel on art and Instagram; Vienna, to guest-curate an exhibit of unrealized design projects; Majorca, to see Miquel Barcels ceramic murals in the cathedral; Edinburgh, where Obrists new memoir, Ways of Curating, was featured at the book fair; and Vancouver, where he appeared onstage with the novelist and futurist Douglas Coupland. In all these locales, he saw as much art as he could, but he also visited scientists and historians. He believes that, because culture is becoming more interconnected across geography and across disciplines, his knowledge must expand far beyond the visual arts: to technology, literature, anthropology, cultural criticism, philosophy. These disciplines, in turn, become tools in Obrists attempt to fertilize the arts with fresh ideas. Another thing that Obrist loves to do is talk. His favorite word is urgent, to which he gives an elongated Mitteleuropean pronunciation. His words come out in an almost comical torrent, citations bobbing up and ideas colliding. Again quoting Ballard, he describes his curatorial work as junction-makingbetween objects, between people, and between people and objects. Words help Obrist process what hes seeing, and he often channels this energy into interviews with artists and cultural figures, which he calls salons of the twenty-first century. He has conducted twenty-four hundred hours of interviews to date, talking to artists in their studios, on planes, or as they walk. Ideally, he records them using three digital recorders, to make sure that nothing gets lost. Wow! Its beginning to look a lot like Xmas.Buy the print  In interviews, Obrists volubility is paired with a deep deference. The architect Rem Koolhaas, in a preface to the Obrist compendium dontstopdontstopdontstop, writes, Usually those afflicted with logorrhea do not stimulate others to communicate; in his case, he rushes to let others do the talking. Obrist respects the art-world compact that though the work may be shocking, the conversation should be supportive. His questions are rarely personal, and when he is being interviewed himself he is similarly guarded: at one point, when I asked him to explain his manic personality, he said, Maybe Im in a permanent state of Pessoas intranquillity. The interviews, over time, become books. He has published forty volumes of them, records of interactions with everyone from Doris Lessing to the video artist Ryan Trecartin. In all, they represent Obrists best claim to being an artist in his own right. He likes to say that he models himself on the impresario Sergei Diaghilev. Obrist is not interested in all art equally. He can be skeptical about painting, because at this point, he told me, its difficult to do meaningful work in that medium. For him, art, even old art, must be speaking to something current. I dont wake up in the morning and think about Franz Kline, he said. The art he is most passionate about doesnt hang on walls and often doesnt have a permanent emanation. It can take the form of a dance or a game or a science experiment, and often leaves nothing behind but memories and an exhibition catalogue. (Obrist has published more than two hundred catalogues.) He looks for work that responds to the current moment or anticipates the moment after this oneObrist is obsessed with the not-yet-done. His favorite question is Do you have any unfinished or unrealized projects? Much of the work that fits Obrists ephemeral aesthetic could be called relational art, a term coined by the Parisian curator Nicolas Bourriaud in the nineteen-nineties to describe work whose content cannot be separated from its communal reception. (Obrist avoids using the term relational himself, in part because the artists never used it.) Abramovis 512 hours is a good example of relational art. There were few props, no script, and no installation; patrons were asked simply to join Abramovi in an unadorned gallery space and conjoin their psychic energy. Another example of Obrists taste is a work by Olafur Eliasson, the Danish-Icelandic artist, whom Obrist helped discover. Obrist was one of a team of curators who invited Eliasson to contribute to a multi-authored opera called Il Tempo del Postino, first staged at the Manchester International Festival, in 2007. Eliasson created a piece, Echo House, in which a reflective curtain dropped in front of the audience, showing audience members their every gesture. Each sound they madefrom coughs to clapswas mimicked sonically by the orchestra. Soon the audience took the lead, improvising a score of shouts and ring tones. These works feel modern, in part, because they mirror the group decision-making found online; at the same time, they foster interactivity without leaving people isolated in front of screens. The Internet is always on Obrists mind, as he scans for signs of cultural shifts. Although his shows often playfully elevate the non-artistic to the curatorialDuchamp is a key figurethey also have a sadness to them. He clearly believes that art offers a refuge at a time when dark beasts, from capitalism to climate change, roam the earth. His friend the artist Liam Gillick sees Obrists taste in art as made up in equal measure of the melancholic sublime and the idea of the productive machine. Obrist, for his part, notes that his exhibits often demonstrate what he has called a quality of unfinishedness and incompleteness. He doesnt like art to have temporal, spatial, or intellectual limits. The white cube of the gallery irks him; closing dates bother him. He prefers to think of exhibitions as seeds that can grow. For one of Obrists early shows, do it, which dbuted in Klagenfurt, Austria, in 1994, twelve artists created instructions rather than finished work. Alison Knowles, a New York artist associated with the Fluxus movement, invited visitors to bring something red and fill one of dozens of squares in the gallery space with it. The exhibition never looked the same from day to day. Other venues soon took it on, and, over the years, artists have dropped in and the instructions have changed. The exhibition, which just celebrated its twentieth anniversary, is one of the most widely produced art shows in the world. Do it is the signature effort of a curator who has followed his own algorithm: see art, meet the artists, produce their shows, use these shows to meet more artists, produce their shows in turn. (In Ways of Curating, Obrist calls social interactions the lifeblood of any curators metabolism.) Cant Yelp rate dry cleaners in order of how good they keep their mouth shut?Buy the print  Every year, the Serpentine holds a Marathona festival that coalesces what Obrist has learned from his travels and his reading and his interviewing. It is a combination of exhibitions, performances, and panels, with writers, visual artists, and cultural historians mixed in freely. The first Marathon, in 2006, was a twenty-four-hour rolling interview session that Obrist co-hosted with Koolhaas. Afterward, Obrist was so exhausted that he had to check himself into the hospital. Koolhaas, who was then sixty-one, did not. He was better trained, because he did a lot of sports, Obrist remembered. (Obrist now jogs every morning in Hyde Park.) Last years Marathon, which Obrist conceived with the French curator Simon Castets, was called 89plus, and focussed on people born that year or later. Obrist explained, 1989 was the year the Berlin Wall came down, and it was the year Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. This is the first generation to live its life entirely on the Internet. Ryan Trecartin and some sixty others participated. Of course, two days were not enough to explore such a subject, and in Obrists mind the exhibit never really ended. He and Castets are now planning an 89plus event, dedicated to poetry, in Stockholm next year. In October, Obrist travelled to New York, and while he was there he held a planning meeting about 89plus at a caf in Greenwich Village. Surrounded by young poets and editors of alternative presses, he asked, Do you know any poets who use Snapchat? His voice was full of hopewhat poetry could be more to Obrists liking than poetry that vanishes? Afterward, we toured art galleries. Obrist was in and out remarkably quickly, like a man with a plane to catch. If a gallery representative took more than twenty seconds to explain a work, Obrist turned his attention to his iPhone. Though he likes to learn, he doesnt like to be told what to pay attention to. But when he saw something he really liked he paused, and a light smile crossed his lips. This happened at the New Museum, which had on display the Lebanese artist Etel Adnans quietly bold abstract landscape paintings, along with a typescript of her book-length poem The Arab Apocalypse. He said, This has something of the Gesamtkunstwerka complete, or all-encompassing, art work. The term is often associated with the sprawling operas of Richard Wagner, but for Obrist it can be something much more nimblea protean creation that is remade over time, absorbing fresh influences from people who engage with it. Something, in other words, much like himself. Obrist was born in Zurich and grew up in a small town near Lake Constance. His father was a comptroller in the construction industry, his mother a grade-school teacher. An only child, he found school too slow, and other Swiss found his vitality off-putting. People would always say that I should go to Germany, he remembered. His parents were not particularly interested in art, but on several occasions they took him to a monastery library in the nearby city of St. Gallen. He admired the antiquity of the books, the silence, the felt shoes. You could make an appointment and, with white cloths, touch the books, he said. Thats one of my deepest childhood memories. Its your turn. Ive run out of pleasantries for the gauntlet.Buy the print  When he was around twelve, he took the train to Zurich, where he fell in love with the long thin figures at a Giacometti exhibition. Soon he was collecting postcards of famous paintingsmy muse imaginaire, he calls it. I would organize them according to criteria: by period, by style, by color. One day, when he was seventeen, he went to see a show by the artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss at a Basel museum. He was engrossed by their Equilibrium sculpturesdelicately balanced metal-and-rubber constructions. He had been reading Vasaris biographical sketches of the artists of the Renaissance, and it struck Obrist that he could try to meet creators, too. He reached out to Fischli and Weiss with this rap: Im a high-school pupil and Im really, really obsessed by your work and Id love to visit you. He told me, I really didnt know what I wanted. It was just this desire to find out more. Fischli and Weiss were amused by the precocious Obrist, and welcomed him to their Zurich studio. They were filming their now famous short film The Way Things Go, in which an old tire rolls down a ramp, knocking over a ladder and setting off a chain reaction. On his visit, Obrist discovered a sheet of brown wrapping paper on the floor with the entire Rube Goldberg schema drawn on it. It was almost like a mind map, he said. Soon afterward, Obrist was entranced by a Gerhard Richter exhibition in Bern, and asked Richter if he could visit his studio, in Cologne. That took courage, he said. He travelled on the night train from Zurich. When I arrived, he was working on one of his amazing cycles of abstract paintings, Obrist said. They talked for ninety minutes. Richter was astonished by Obrists passion: Possessed is the word for Hans Ulrich, he told me. Richter recommended the music of John Cage. We discussed chance in paintings and he said he liked playing boules, Obrist recalled. A few months later, Obrist was in a Cologne park, playing boules with Richter and his friends. Obrist doggedly arranged to meet other artists whose work he admired. He went to see Alighiero Boetti in Rome. The feverish Boetti may be the only person ever to complain that Obrist didnt talk fast enough. (In his new book, Obrist writes with delight, Here was someone with whom I had to struggle to keep up.) When Obrist asked him how he could be useful to art, Boetti pointed out the obvious: that he was born to be a curator. Obrist wasnt sure what the job entailed, but he was intuitively drawn to the power of organizing art. As a teen-ager, he visited an exhibition at the Kunsthaus in Zurich: Der Hang zum Gesamtkunstwerk, or Tendency Toward the Total Work of Art. It highlighted four selections from the past hundred years of modernism: Duchamps enigmatic glass construction The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, and one painting each by Kandinsky, Mondrian, and Malevich. The works had been placed at the center of the Kunsthaus, heightening their effect. Obrist was struck by the intelligence of the man who had organized it: Harald Szeemann. Also a Swiss, Szeemann was one of several curators who had begun to bring a new inventiveness to the age-old job of selecting art to illustrate a theme. Obrist saw the show forty-one times. (Later, of course, he interviewed Szeemann.) Obrist did not yet feel qualified to put his stamp on the art world. He had the autodidacts anxiety about not knowing enough. For all his energy, he was not a revolutionary; he was an accumulator of information. But how to find out what artists were doing? There wasnt then a place to study, he said. I knew of no curator schools. So he designed his own education. He enrolled at the University of St. Gallen, and majored in economics and social sciences. When not in class, he set out to see as many shows as he could. Switzerland is well situated if you want to make impulsive trips around Europe. Obrist spoke five languages: German, French, Italian, Spanish, and English. (His English was given a boost by Rogets Thesaurus, and he still keeps a vocabulary list in a blue notebook that he takes with himamong the latest words are forage and hue.) He took the night train to avoid hotel bills and arrived in a city the next morning. I would go to every museum and look and look again, he remembered. Then he visited local artists. He found that he could improve his welcome if he brought news of what he had seen, plus other artists gossip and opinions. I would go from one city to the next, inspired by the monks in the Middle Ages, who would carry knowledge from one monastery to the next monastery, he said. At Boettis suggestion, he also inquired about unrealized projects, as every artist had some and felt passionate about them. Above all, he listened. I was what the French call tre  lcoute, he told me. His youthful intensity sometimes raised concern. Louise Bourgeois, after meeting the teen-age Hans Ulrich, sleep-deprived and suffering from a cold, called his mother in Switzerland and urged her to take better care of her son. Are you still using that outlet?Buy the print  In 1991, Obrist, in his early twenties, finally felt ready. By then, he estimates, he had visited tens of thousands of exhibitions and knew more artists than most professional curators. He chose to hold his first show in the kitchen of his student apartment. The kitchen was just another place I kept stacks of books and papers, he recalled. The minimalist gesture seemed appropriate, both as a reaction to the engorged art market of the eighties and as a reflection of the economic slump across Europe. It was also a playful homage: Harald Szeemann had done an exhibit in an apartment. The idea of the show was to suggest that the most ordinary spaces of human life, cleverly curated, could be made special. Among the friends he included was the French painter and sculptor Christian Boltanski. Under the sink, Boltanski projected a film of a lit candle; the flickering could be seen through the gap in the cabinet doors. It was like a little miracle where you expect it least, Obrist remembered. He publicized the exhibit through small cards and word of mouth; still, he was relieved that only thirty people came over the three months it was open. I was still studying and couldnt have coped with much more, he said. Among those attending was a curator from the Cartier Foundation, a contemporary-art museum in Paris. Soon afterward, Cartier offered Obrist a three-month fellowship. Obrist took it, leaving Switzerland for good. Obrist quickly became a figure on the European art circuit. He was a clearing house for news and relationships, and he was generousno sooner had he met someone than he helped that person connect with others in his widening circle. If he stayed in a hotel, he cleaned out the postcards in the lobby and mailed them to everyone he could think of. He had these big plastic bags, Marina Abramovi, who met him in Hamburg in 1993, recalled. I always wanted him to empty them and list all that was inside.... He would have information of every single human beingevery artist living in a favela! She remembered him as astonishingly innocent, an adjective that many still use for him. Many artists saw his unchecked commitment as a counterpart to their own. The French artist Philippe Parreno said, For me, there is no difference between talking to him and talking to other artists. I am engaged at the same level. Obrist once conducted an interview with Parreno while driving him from the Dublin airport to Connemara, and became so deeply absorbed that he didnt realize he was on the wrong side of the street. Obrist continued to set up shows in unusual locations. He put on an exhibit of Richters paintings in the country house where Nietzsche wrote part of Also Sprach Zarathustra, and a show in a hotel restaurant where Robert Walser, the Swiss writer, used to stop during long walks through the mountains. A third took place in Room 763 at the Hotel Carlton Palace, in Paris, where Obrist was then staying. In one part of the exhibit, called The Armoire Show, nine artists created clothes for the closet. With Fischli and Weiss, he toured the Zurich sewer museum. They had toilets and urinals on plinths and had never heard of Duchamp, he marvelled. This inspired him to put together Cloaca Maxima, which featured art about lavatories and digestion. The show opened in 1994, in and around the Zurich sewers. During much of the nineties, Obrist held a part-time position at the Muse dArt Moderne de la Ville de Paris. He was the museums head of Migratory Curationa whimsical title that was, essentially, an invitation to travel and find new talent. In 1995, Julia Peyton-Jones, the director of the Serpentine, invited Obrist to put on a show there. He proposed an exhibition called Take Me (Im Yours), in which visitors were asked to leave with an object from the exhibit. It was a huge success, and many felt that Obrist had subverted the passive expectations of a museum visit: fill up on culture and leave. He had injected a note of interactivity into staid Britain. (Frieze was less impressed: The viewers participation is rewarded with some worthless gesture or rubbish souvenir.) Buy the print  While working on the Serpentine show, Obrist rented a three-bedroom flat on Crampton Street in Elephant and Castle, then a marginal neighborhood. He had fifty copies of his house keys made and handed them out to artists and curators passing through London. Conversations with his guests often lasted through the night; then, at six in the morning, Obrist went with whoever was still awake to a nearby McDonaldsthe only place around that was open at that hour. Klaus Biesenbach, who is now the director of moma PS 1, in Queens, stayed with Obrist for a time. One day, Biesenbach told me, a Korean artist named Koo Jeong-A arrived. Koo, then in her mid-twenties, made delicate installations: heaps of domestic dust, an arrangement of leaves, piles of coins. Her work was ephemeral, and she hated to be interviewed. Obrist had shown some of her efforts in Paris and had invited her to set up an installation in the Crampton Street flat. In the morning, the three would meet for discussions, Biesenbach recalled. And one morning, I remember, they came out of one room. Wow, I thought, they must have had a meeting before. Why didnt they invite me to the meeting? And the next morning they came again out of the room. Obrist and Koo have been together ever since. The sharp-tongued English press continued to poke at Obrist. Adrian Searle, an art critic for the Guardian, wrote in 1999 that he often found Obrists curating deeply irritating. But Obrists coterie is less reviewers than artists, collectors, and other curators, who are almost always interested in his projects. Perhaps his greatest triumph was Cities on the Move, a collaboration with the Chinese curator Hou Hanru, which dbuted in Vienna in 1997. It was a timely exploration of the artistic and demographic landscape of Asiaa look at what Koolhaas, a participant, called cities of exacerbated difference. Scaffolding permeated the installation; there were rickshaw taxis festooned with fabulous colors. Conventional art work peeked out from corners. In a 1999 London incarnation of the show, Koo set up a bedroom in the gallery while finishing an installation; visitors got to see the blankets and clothes that she had left behind. This time, Searle praised Obrist: His strengths as a kind of cross-disciplinary impresario have found their subject. He knows not only how to create chaos, but also how to curate it. In 2000, Obrist began to tire. He and Koo wanted a more stable base for their lives and he wanted to curate solo shows. There is nothing deeper than to work for a year with the same artist, he said. So he accepted an offer from the Muse de la Ville de Paris to be a full-time curator. He remained in France until 2006, when Julia Peyton-Jones made him her co-director at the Serpentine. Koo and Obrist now share a small apartment in Kensington, near the gallery. When I visited Obrist there, the closest thing to food in the kitchen was Diet Coke. The walls were almost bare. Fluorescent lights drenched a living room filled with books arranged on industrial shelving. Among the titles were Ben Lerners metafictional novel 10:04 and Jacques Derridas monograph on the sense of touch. I was bemused that a person who lived by his eyes lived in such a nondescript place, but Obrists interest in anything outside high culture is fitful. I never heard him talk about sports or favorite restaurants or how much something costs. He has never made a cup of coffee, and tried cooking only once; the phone rang and he forgot the saucepan, which caught fire. Sleep has always seemed extraneous to Obrist. During the early nineties, he tried Balzacs caffeine regime, drinking dozens of cups of coffee a day. Then he switched to the Da Vinci method, limiting himself to a fifteen-minute nap every three hours. Now he tries to get four or five hours every night. He has an assistant who comes to his apartment at midnight to help him with his interviews and books. That way, when Im out, I know its time to go home, he said. Obrist sleeps while the assistant works, then wakes up and takes over. He still likes to meet people at dawn for conversation: in 2006, he founded the Brutally Early Club, which meets at 6:30 a.m., at various sites around London. (Another of Obrists conceits is that modern life is characterized by a decline in ritual. He ascribes the idea to Margaret Mead.) March 8, 2010Can you stop complaining about historical innaccuracy and try to enjoy yourself for one minute?Buy the print  Obrist first appeared on ArtReviews most-powerful list in 2002, and by 2009 he had risen to the top. His rolling-suitcase approach to life seemed to reflect signal changes in the art world, which was becoming faster, bigger, and vastly more international. London alone has about eight times as many galleries as it had in 1980, and Beijing and Baku and Mexico City compete for attention with Paris and New York. Increasingly, the most powerful curators are those who have the stamina (and the budget) to see enormous amounts of art and distill it into themes and movements. Among the frequent fliers are Biesenbach, of PS 1; Daniel Birnbaum, of the Moderna Museet, in Stockholm; and Massimiliano Gioni, of the New Museum, in New York. Obrist and Biesenbach first met, by chance, on a night train to Venice in 1993, on the way to the Biennale. Biesenbach, who was putting on shows in Berlin, was trying to sleep, and Obrist plunged into his compartment and kept him up the whole night. We discussed how its urgent to capture the Berlin moment, Obrist recalled. Five years later, they helped put together the first Berlin Biennial, and they have been close collaborators ever since. Birnbaum, who started out as a critic and then became a dean at an art academy, was spurred to become the sort of roving international curator Obrist is after years of conversation with him. Hans is enthusiastic, and somehow he can make other people enthusiastic, Birnbaum said. Obrist was also one of Gionis original guideposts. As a university student at Bologna, Gioni began a correspondence with Obrist that informed his practice when he entered the art world. He really established curating as a term, a discipline, an M.O. Gioni said, adding, The Dadaists had Tzara, the Surrealists Breton, the futurists Marinetti, and now the international global art world has Hans Ulrich Obrist. In many ways, an Obrist generation is running the nonprofit art world. In 2010, Jens Hoffmann, the top curator at the Jewish Museum, who considers Obrist his mentor, wrote in the magazine Mousse: Almost all of the innovative work done by exhibition makers in mainstream art institutions over the last decade owes much to ideas that Obrist first introduced. Not everyone considers this a good thing. Claire Bishop, an art historian at CUNY, told me, The world of contemporary art is fast-moving and superficial and demands constant feeding, and hes a prime example. Though Obrist is often assumed to be the kind of megalomaniac who is more prominent than the artists he showsand who is willing to crush the heterogeneity of artists work in order to extract coherent themesthat assumption doesnt properly capture him. He seems as egoless as he is guileless and stateless. Liam Gillick said, When you work with him, he absolutely protects you and creates enormous space for what you need to doand yet no one knows hes done it. Indeed, its hard to reconcile the idea that Obrist is a domineering superstar with the fact that nearly all his shows are collaborations with other curators. As Gillick puts it, He stands against a certain sort of very assertive, very authored curating that was prominent when we were young. He has a real anti-authoritarian streak. I first met Obrist in Los Angeles, in July. He was there to conduct one of his periodic checks on the citys art galleries. He also planned to visit the studios of John Baldessari, Ed Ruscha, and Chris Burden, and attend the L.A. Biennial, at the Hammer Museum. Finally, there was the panel on Instagram to host. Obrist is an avid user of the medium, and has more than a hundred thousand followers. The story of how he discovered Instagram is typical. During a breakfast in 2012 with Ryan Trecartin, the video artist downloaded the app onto Obrists phone (without asking). Next, Trecartin posted to his Instagram followers that H.U.O. had signed up. Obrist was curious, but he wondered what to do with the new tool. Inspiration was sparked by other well-known friends. On a visit to Normandy, he went for a walk with Etel Adnan, the Lebanese artist. During a rainstorm, they stopped at a caf, and she wrote him a poem, by hand. This made Obrist remember Umberto Ecos comments on how handwriting was vanishing; he also thought of marvellous faxes he had received, all handwritten, from J. G. Ballard, when he interviewed him, in 2003. Adnans handwritten poem became one of Obrists first Instagram posts. Soon afterward, he remembered that another friend, the artist Joseph Grigely, who is deaf, uses Post-It notes to communicate; they are often incorporated into his art. H.U.O. began asking dozens of artists to write something on a Post-It. He posted the scrawlings on Instagram. Yoko Ono wrote, in soft black ink, Time to Tell your love. Richter filled a dun-colored Post-It in his jagged hand: Art as part of our insane capacity for hope makes it possible that we cope with our permanent madness and our boundless brutality. Obrist just surpassed eight hundred posts. Maybe the iPhone is the new nanomuseum, he told me, hopefully. November 8, 2010Did Jesus create these locally?Buy the print  Obrists first stop in L.A. was at Baldessaris studio, in Venice. He arrived there at one oclock, in a black S.U.V. with a driver. He was wearing a three-button suit, a white shirt, and blue tennis sneakers. An old photograph of Obrist, which can be found on the Internet, shows a vigorous young man with tousled hair and intense eyes, but the Da Vinci regimen and air travel have been punishing. He is now nearly bald, and the remaining tufts of hair are white. He had chosen not to sleep the previous night in London, so that he could sleep on the flight. That, in tandem with a hood that he puts on for quick naps at his office, is his current sleep-minimizing technique. He had with him two enormously heavy pieces of luggage. It is my exercise, he explained. The suitcases were filled mostly with his publications, which he planned to hand out. We entered the studio through a gate. Every visit to Los Angeles begins with John, and has for twenty years, Obrist told me. Baldessari, eighty-three, tall and shambly, greeted us. Baldessari has contributed work to various Obrist exhibitions, and would happily do so again. Hes like a good mom, he told me. Everything my son has done is good. He took us to a room where new work lined the walls. The Stdel Museum, in Frankfurt, had commissioned him to reinterpret paintings from its collection; he had responded by creating large panels that juxtaposed fragments of text from screenplays with visual details scanned from works at the Stdel. In one panel, movie dialogue in which two lovers discuss money was paired with a gorgeous closeup of a leg from Cranach the Elders 1532 painting Venus. Did the words and image create a plot? Or had Baldessari merely made a surreal juxtaposition? The ambiguity delighted Obrist, who pointed out that Baldessari had restored context that Cranach had deliberately stripped out. When you have a Venus, you usually have a Cupid, he explained. He told Baldessari, This is amazing. So exciting! He drew out the syllables: eg-zi-tink! Obrist has a gummy, soft smile, and a Brunelleschi dome of a forehead. He carries his shoulders back when he stands, and the effect is to shorten his arms, making him look like a boy. Afterward, we sat in Baldessaris study, amid tables on casters stacked neatly with art magazines. Well, thats what Ive been up to, Baldessari said. Congratulations, Obrist said. None of this work was here six months ago! Soon, Obrist was back in the S.U.V. Baldessaris work had prompted an idea: it was wise not to isolate contemporary art but to create a continuum with history. Baldessaris project not only enlisted the spectator in making meaning; it created a junction between the living and the dead. Just as old art must look forward, new art should look back. Obrists next visit was to Ruscha, whose studio is a low unmarked building in Culver City, five miles away. Baldessari and Obrist have a rapport: they are both impersonally personable. Ruscha has a cooler nature, and though he recognizes Obrists centrality in the art worldI see his name pretty much constantlyhe is also skeptical of him. His telephone is continually tinging and leaving twicks and tweets and all that, he told me, adding, Im like one little fragment of his interest. Ruscha took Obrist out back to an open-air studio to show him new works in his Psycho Spaghetti Western series, which was inspired by roadside debris. Ruscha did not seem like Obrists kind of artist: his paintings have a deeply American irony that seemed destined to elude the earnest Swiss. But Obrist sought, as always, to make a connection. The strewn objects on Ruschas canvases, he declared, reminded him of In the Country of Last Things, a dystopian novel by Paul Auster. The tour finished. Ruscha took a seat behind a cherrywood desk, and fixed Obrist with his blue eyes, a dog at his feet. Obrist asked where the new paintings would be exhibited, but it was not as easy to gain traction with Ruscha as it had been with Baldessari. In Rome. At the Gagosian gallery. Obrist, name-dropping, said that hed once visited Cy Twombly at his studio in Rome. Ruscha didnt seem to care. Obrist then expressed admiration for Guacamole Airlines, a book of drawings that Ruscha had made. That was forty years ago, Ruscha said. This must have been what it was like when Obrist was a youth, surrounded by taciturn Swiss. Obrists arms tend to go into motion when there is silence. He asked Ruscha about a show the artist had organized at Viennas Kunsthistorisches Museum, in 2012. What did you do, exactly? Obrist asked. Ruscha said that he had taken some meteorites and stuffed animals and some Old Masters and put them on display. He had included one of his own paintings. October 2, 2006Id like you to meet my pillows.Buy the print  One no longer isolates so much of contemporary art, Obrist said, sharing his latest epiphany. The contemporary is now connected to the historical. Ruscha continued to smile. Eventually, he said, They told me not to go throwing that word curator around. I was told I was just assembling an exhibit. Maybe we need a new word, Obrist said. Yah. I dont want to take more of your time, Obrist said, after a moment. On his way out, Obrist asked Ruscha to contribute to his Instagram project. Ruscha told me later, I gave him something that said, On the bag before the tag. Some baseball announcer said that. He added that he had no idea what Instagram was. Obrist, in turn, didnt catch the baseball reference. The next day, Obrist went to visit Burden, who lives in Topanga Canyon, north of the city. He was excited: Burden was an important performance artist in the seventies, and Obrist admires the installations that he has been making in recent years. Outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art*, Burden created a dense plot of refurbished lamppostsa glowing garden that has become an actual junction for nighttime visitors. Burden also creates elaborate toys and contraptions that speak to the geeky side of Obrist, as Fischli and Weiss did long ago. After climbing a rugged road, we arrived at the top of a small mountain. Burden met us at the door. Squat and muscular, he looked as if he had been lifting weights and was still mad at them. I can give you a tour, he said. Or maybe you have something to tell me. He didnt want photographs taken of his hangarlike studio. Next thing you know, theyre on your Web site, he said. Obrist put his recorder away. But he is adept at winning over artists. After touring the studio, they went outside, past rows of lampposts, ordnance shells, and mermaid caryatids. Soon they were clambering around on a forty-foot steel tower Burden had built, like two boys with a giant erector set. Back inside, Obrist asked him about unrealized projects. I had a dream of building this city called Xanadu, Burden said. He showed Obrist some drawings. That is a huge unrealized project! Obrist said. He clapped his hands with pleasure. A real city that no one lives in. Thats awfully exciting. I had no idea about this! He promised to visit Burden again on his next trip. As the S.U.V. careered down the hill, Obrist checked his e-mails and texts and pronounced the visit super-super-productive. In mid-October, Obrist put on the Serpentines ninth annual Marathon, in Hyde Park. The press had framed the show, Extinction: Visions of the Future, as a depressing alternative to the ebullient Frieze Art Fair taking place in Regents Park. Nevertheless, the Serpentine event drew a crowd, with more than four thousand attendees. It had a carnival feel, underscored by three big Mylar balloons, spelling out HUO, that were tethered to a tent where the speakers gathered. When I arrived, Obrist, wearing a blue single-breasted suit, was making rapid-fire introductions among the gathered artists, ecologists, writers, researchers, activists, sages, and prognosticators. He seemed to be going slightly mad. Obrist told me that his own unrealized project is to found a new version of Black Mountain College, the defunct North Carolina retreat where, sixty years ago, top practitioners in the arts, culture, and the sciences taught and exchanged ideas. That ambition, combined with his admiration for Diaghilev, had shaped the Serpentine event. The guiding presence was the eighty-eight-year-old artist Gustav Metzger, who had sat through the entire first Marathon. Although he is ailing and in a wheelchair, he attended nearly all of this years proceedings. Obrist, in his opening remarks, declared that Metzgera longtime environmental activisthad helped inspire the theme of Extinction. Julia Peyton-Jones, who sometimes plays the goof to Obrists Luftmensch, dedicated the Marathon to the pangolinan adorable, endangered mammal that looks like an anteater. September 23, 2002Now that the kids are in jail maybe we can take that vacation we always wanted to take.Buy the print  The performances and the talks took place on a small stage with a backdrop of an oversized hand pointing at black trash bags. To begin, several scientists delivered bad news. At least eight hundred and seventy species had been wiped out in the past four hundred years. Jonathan Baillie, of the London Zoological Society, noted that, of the seven remaining northern-white rhinos, one had died the previous day, in Kenya. Jennifer Jacquet, an environmental social scientist at New York University, spoke about the decimation of the Stellers sea cow, which was hunted for sportand for its blubberin the eighteenth century. Suddenly, Gilbert & George, the painting duo known for cheeky irony, came onstage, in bespoke nibbed suits and bright-colored ties. They unfurled spray-painted posters. BURN THAT BOOK, Gilberts said. FUCK THE PLANET, Georges said. They were lampooning the ignorance of climate-change deniers, but the audience wasnt sure what to make of them. After a few more speakers, Obrist stood up. Coffee breaks are urgent! he said.  Later in the day, Stewart Brand, who created the Whole Earth Catalog, amused the crowd when he took a showy tumble off the stage, to impersonate the death of a lemming. Brand then spoke about efforts to clone extinct species. Passenger pigeons would come first, he promised, then mammoths. The more excited Brand got, the more uncomfortable the audience seemed. Obrist informed me that his friend John Brockman, a science impresario and literary agent, had selected most of the scientists. We dont know the important scientists, and they dont know the good artists, Obrist explained. Perhaps as a result, the science had an austere implacability to it, and the art often seemed to aestheticize tragedy. Benedict Drew, a young English artist, created a hectic digital montage that included a disembodied head and images of a garbage dump intercut with ominous messages. (We are done for.) The piece, weighed down with sinister synthesizer music, was called Not Happy. When the words Why you so happy Pharrell flashed, the audience laughed in relief. At times, the worlds of science and art came together: an oddly moving presentation by Trevor Paglen focussed on communication satellites that will circle the earth for billions of years after humans are extinct. But most of the time the scientists conveyed the information and the artists the hurt. A bewildering variety of extinctions were invoked: of plants, of gays, of languages, of books on paper, of celluloid film. Obrist, surrounded by half-drunk cups of coffee, got up to introduce presenters and then sat back down in the front row, where he and Peyton-Jones, who sat by his side, passed notes to each other and to their assistants, who sat behind them. The Marathon ended with a new participatory piece by Yoko Ono that was read aloud by Lily Cole, a model and environmental activist, for which the audience was given small bells to ring. Dont try to change the world, thats a concept floating on our horizon, Cole read. Just use your wits and change your heads. On a large screen by the stage, the words Surrender to Peace appeared. In the audience, bells prettily chimed. The message seemed at odds with much of the Marathon. Wasnt changing the world the point? Then again, there was not a single policy official among the eighty participants. The real goal, it seemed, was to conjure a sense of community. It was quite magical, Obrist said of the chorus of bells. The participants did at least fifty per cent of the work. He added that smaller actions can lead to bigger actions. Obrist had brought together an eye-catching roster of participants, but epic conversation was not well suited to addressing the urgent topic of extinction. It sometimes seems that Obrist doesnt care so much what people say, as long as they keep talking. In 2003, Hal Foster, an art historian at Princeton, published an essay that touched on Obrists first collection of interviews. Formlessness in society might be a condition to contest rather than to celebrate in art, Foster pointed out. Nothing at the Marathon was as strong as a Metzger work titled Flailing Trees: twenty-one willows planted upside down in concrete. The installation was first displayed in 2009, at the Manchester International Festival. Metzger had been included in that festival at Obrists suggestion, and it had been a smart one: Flailing Trees is rigorous, beautiful, sad. December 1, 2008Load the holiday catalogues.Buy the print  After the Marathon, Obrist told me that the performance artist Tino Seghal had watched a live stream of the Marathon and had especially enjoyed a talk by Elizabeth Povinelli, an anthropologist at Columbia. Tinos reading her book now! Obrist said. Who knew what collaborations might result? This was a different sort of Gesamtkunstwerk, he saidone more in time than in space. As the crowd dispersed, H.U.O. posed in front of the balloons with his initials. This topic isnt going to be solved in a night, he said. I see the Extinction Marathon as a movement. Then he noted, I have a five-forty train in the morning. The Eurostar to Paris."

If you dont read anything else today, I suggest you look at the editorial about Eric Garner in the Times and Bill Bramhalls editorial cartoon in the Daily News.  The editorialpoints out the obvious, which, in this case, needed saying: The imbalance between Mr. Garners fate, on a Staten Island sidewalk in July, and his supposed infraction, selling loose cigarettes, is grotesque and outrageous. Bramhalls cartoonshows Lady Justice, splayed out on the sidewalk, her sword and scales of justice scattered around her, saying, I  CANT  BREATHE. Those words were, of course, the last ones that Garner, a forty-three-year-old black man, uttered while being held down on a sidewalk on Staten Islandby cops, including one, officer Daniel Pantaleo, who had him in what N.Y.P.D. commissioner William Bratton subsequently described as an unauthorized chokehold. In a front-page headline, the DailyNews changed Garners words a bit, to read We Cant Breathe, which accurately summed up the feelings of many New Yorkers, and many Americans outside New York, when they heard that a grand jury had decided not to bring charges against Pantaleo or anyone else. Coming less than two weeks after another grand jury, in Ferguson, Missouri, decided not to bring any charges in the death of Michael Brown, this latest news prompted a series of protests, most of them peaceful, in New York and other cities. That was understandablenecessary, even. Garners death, on July 17th, was, in some ways, even more shocking, and even harder to fathom, than what happened in Missouri. In that case, most witnesses agree, there was an altercation between Brown and Officer Darren Wilson, who followed Brown out of his car, across the street, and shot him dead. In this one, on Bay Street, in the Tompkinsville section of Staten Island, not very far from the ferry terminal, Garner was standing in front of a beauty-supply store when some police officersapproached him and apparently alleged that he was peddling loose cigarettes. A videorecorded by a friend of Garner namedRamsey Orta shows much ofwhat ensued; it suggests that Garner posed no threat to anybody. Having been picked up before in similar circumstances, Garner told the cops to leave him alone, gesturing with his hands as he spoke. As a couple of officers reached for him, he said, Dont touch me, please. Moreofficers joined in the struggle, and Pantaleo seized Garner from behind, subduing him and bowling him over, before Garner was cuffed. After losing consciousness, he went into cardiac arrest and died in an ambulance that came to pick him up. An autopsy by the citys medical examiners office found that Garner died as a result of compression of the neck and body, and cited his history of asthma, heart disease, and obesity as contributing factors. The office ruled the death a homicide, which simply means the killing of one person by another. The question that the grand jury faced was whether this was a lawful killing. After its decision was announced, Pantaleo issued a statement in which he said, I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who cant protect themselves. It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner. Evidently, the members of the grand jury believed that Pantaleo bore nocriminal intent, and this would explain why they didnt indict him for murder. However, the question remains why no charges of criminally negligent homicide have been brought against Pantaleo or any of his colleagues who left Garner on the ground for several minutes before trying to resuscitate him, or any of the emergency medical staff who showed up and, according to some accounts, didnt do much to assist him either. (After the incident, several medics were suspended without pay.) If you watch Ortas video, and another,released later, showing Garner as he lay on the street, handcuffed,its hard to avoid reaching the conclusion that, at the very least, there was serious negligence on display. In the past twenty-five years, the New York Police Department has had a lot to be proud of. It pioneered data-driven policing and helped bring the citys crime rate down to historic lows. Even in poor and deprived areas, such as the area whereGarner lived, crime is a lot less common than it used to be. For example, N.Y.P.D. figures show that, in 1990, there were more than sixty-seven hundred serious crimes (murders, rapes, assaults, robberies, burglaries, and grand larcenies) reportedin the Hundred and Twentieth Precinct, which includes Tompkinsville. Last year, there were fewer than fourteen hundred such crimes, a declineof about eighty per cent. And, as the crime rate has dropped, the N.Y.P.D., unlike some other police forces, hasgone out of its way to recruit minorities: at the rank of police officer, there are now more minority cops than white cops in New York. But reducing crime and integrating the ranks doesnt justify mistreating elements of the citizenry whodont present a genuine public threat, particularly unarmed black men; and it certainly doesnt justify causing their deaths. As the Times editorial put it, Any police department that tolerates such conduct, and whose officers are unable or unwilling to defuse such confrontations without killing people, needs to be reformed.

The New Yorker,L,Why Cameras on Police Officers Wont Save Us - The New Yorker,"

 


One reaction to the decision by a grand jury in New York, on Wednesday, not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put a Staten Island man named Eric Garner in an unauthorized chokehold that killed him, is despair over cameras as potential instruments of juridical salvation. On Monday, in an effort to improve police accountability after a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, declined to indict the white police officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old, the Obama Administration announced that it would provide local police departments with funding to purchase fifty thousand body-worn video cameras. Garners death had became infamous precisely because it was videotaped by a friend of Garners with a cell phone, and the video, which we could all watch on YouTube, was not blurry or muffled or ambiguous. It was not at all hard to make out Garners last words, I cant breathe, repeated over and over and over again. My son, a college freshman in New York, texted me after the grand-jury news came out: What makes this sad is it shows the mandatory cameras for cops idea might not change anything. If evidence like that in the Garner case couldnt elicit an indictment, what was the point?  The truth is that if the cameras do offer a benefitand there is some, not a lot, of research showing that they doits in influencing behavior before the fact, not providing evidence after it. In two cities where the effect of body-worn cameras has been studiedRialto, California, and Mesa, Arizonaresearchers noted that the cameras had exerted a civilizing effect on police behavior. In Rialto, citizen complaints against the police declined by eighty-eight per cent during the year that the cameras were used, while the use of force by police officers fell by sixty per cent. Moreover, the incidents involving the use of force by camera-wearing officers all started with a suspect physically threatening the officer. The numbers suggest that such provocation was not an essential element with officers who werent wearing cameras. In a 2014 Department of Justice report, the criminologist Michael D. White, who looked at five empirical studies involving body-worn cameras (two in Arizona, one in California, one in England, and one in Scotland), notes that we cant be sure what produced the decrease in complaints and instances of use of force by the camera-wearing cops. It could be that the officers, knowing that their actions were being recorded, behaved with more restraint, or it could be that citizens did. But it seems more likely that the police would be conscious of the cameras presencethe devices are usually worn hooked to a shirt or mounted on a pair of sunglasses, and the officers knew that they were participating in an experimentthan most civilians, who may not notice the green recording light. White concluded that the videotapes played some role in chronicling and accounting for police actions: they helped police officers to resolve citizen complaints against them more quickly, and they made unwarranted and frivolous complaints less likely. As it happened, the benefits as evidence tended to accrue to the policewhich is fine, of course, provided that they are serving the larger goal of establishing the truth and a standard of behavior. Still, most people who have high hopes for the cameras probably arent primarily concerned with wiping out some scourge of frivolous citizen complaints but, rather, with achieving justice for citizens like Eric Garner. Maybe the bigger lesson is, again, that cameras wont save us. Like photographs and like eyewitness testimony, video evidence is subject to differing interpretations, and to the prejudices and assumptions of individual viewers. Weve known that for a long time; still, we cant help hoping. One of the only cases in recent years in which a New York police officer was indicted, charged, and convicted in the death of a citizen occurred in 1994. As it happens, it also involved a police officer administering a chokehold to a man, the twenty-nine-year-old asthmatic Anthony Baez, a security guard who was playing football in the street with his brothers when the ball landed on a police car, and an altercation ensued. Why that case and not Garners resulted in an indictment isnt clearand, in any event, the officers conviction was later overturned. But there was no video evidence in Baezs case. And yet the cell-phone video of Eric Garners death was not meaningless. The fact that so many people watched it is part of what fuelled the outrage that produced demonstrations, as well as a Justice Department investigation that the Obama Administration announced this week. But there is also something deeply sad and demoralizing about having in our collective possession such a vivid record of a death that could neither be prevented nor, in any immediate way, remedied.

The New Yorker,L,The Carnival Logic of American Horror Story: Freak Show,"

 

This season of the show takes the 1932 movie Freaks as an inspiration.

A little culture for the TV viewers. God knows they need it, Madame Elsa, played by Jessica Lange, purrs. A sideshow impresario and a double amputee, Elsa has just finished crooning September Song to her lover, Paul the Illustrated Sealshes rehearsing for her anticipated musical dbut on that novelty stage of the nineteen-fifties, the television screen. Handsome as a matine idol, Paul (Mat Fraser) reclines on an ottoman, his flippers resting beside his tattooed chest. American Horror Story has always been a show dedicated to spectacle, and when I first heard that this season would be set in a freak show in Florida I yelped out loud. What could be more perfect? Brassy and divinely decadent, American Horror Story, which was co-created by Ryan Murphy and is now in its fourth season, is one of TVs few truly experimental seriesand, like many seedy carnivals, its been subject to both nervous laughter and progressive criticism. A mashup of sensational genres, from horror to vaudeville, the show has revived the anthology model, with a new setting and a new story each season. A revolving repertory of actorsLange, Sarah Paulson, Kathy Bates, Denis OHareplay different roles each round (and often adopt ever crazier accents). Like many of Murphys shows (he also created Glee and Nip/Tuck), American Horror Story doesnt always make sense. Sometimes, as with Coven, last seasons arc, which dealt with witchcraft and slavery, its downright clumsy about its incendiary themes. But when it shinesas was the case during its most brilliant season, Asylumthe show is a true provocation, a scream in both senses, drawing little distinction between a scare, a turn-on, an eye roll, and a giggle. Its a smart show thats never haughty or solemn, with an aesthetic thats reflexively shameless, in the best way, about serious subjectsincluding, this season, disability. Andrew Solomon, in his excellent book Far from the Tree, describes two kinds of identity available to the disabled: vertical (the family theyre descended from) and horizontal (the people with whom they share a physical trait, like dwarfism or deafness). Freak Show is about many thingsclown phobia, snuff films, David Bowiebut, primarily, its about horizontal identity, as viewed in a fun-house mirror, distorted by fury and desire. In this theme, it replicates its source material: the classic horror movie Freaks (1932), which was about circus performers who take violent revenge on a villainous normal woman, Cleopatra, when she exploits a member of their troupe. (If Cleopatra existed in the modern era, the word for her would be ableist.) The director Tod Brownings pet project (he ran away at sixteen to join the circus himself), the film was a notorious flop, and wrecked its creators career. The studio demanded that Browning edit out a castration sequence and add a sappy ending; even so, after a test screening the producers were accused of causing a moviegoers miscarriage. In the nineteen-seventies, Freaks became a cult sensation, best known for the chant Gooble, gobble! One of us, one of us! Freak Show is an elaborate remix of the original, stamping Brownings iconic characters with Murphys high-camp image: Cleopatra becomes Langes Germanic dominatrix, who lost her legs to a chain saw; Michael Chiklis plays a closeted strongman; Kathy Bates is a poignant bearded lady; Angela Bassett is a three-breasted hermaphrodite; and Sarah Paulson is the conjoined twins Dot and Bette, who lean in from the sides of the frame like wilted stalks. (Theyre so frequently filmed as reflections in mirrors that, often, they feel like doubles of a double.) Were now two-thirds of the way through the season, and the series continues to offer up variants on the Freaks narrative, about a normal girl who flirts with a freak, placing them side by side with more earnest themes, like the hunt for a non-bigoted doctor. Murphy has also folded in his own obsessions: glam-rock musical numbers, homoerotic serial killers, and the toxic effects of Hollywood vanity. Refreshingly, the season is also genuinely frightening, with at least one truly nightmarish vision per week. It opened with one of the seriess dirtiest, weirdest villains yet, a mute clown named Twisty, who kidnapped children; once Twisty was dispatched, up popped a chilling replacement, Dandy, a preening sociopath who styles himself the U.S. Steel of Murder. Dandy became Twistys assistant, or maybe just his unpaid intern, after he received the clown as an ill-conceived gift from his mother. A spoiled American man-child, Dandy murders as a form of narcissistic tantrumor perhaps, his mother suggests, as the result of upper-class inbreeding. Jack the Ripper was a Windsor, for Gods sake! she exclaims. Like Freaks, Freak Show also mingles able-bodied actorssome wear prosthetics, while others are altered with special effectswith what the marvellously charismatic Mat Fraser terms a radically different person onstage entertaining with their radical difference. Fraser is a British performance artist, sometimes using the name Seal Boy, who has created shows like the burlesque Beauty and the Beast and Thalidomide!! A Musical. Theres also Jyoti Amge, as Ma Petite, a tiny dwarf; the trans actress Erika Ervin, as the giantess Amazon Eve; and Ben Woolf, who has pituitary dwarfism, as Meep, a pinhead. Rose Siggins, who was born with a condition called sacral agenesis, plays Legless Suzi. When the season began, these characters had few lines, which suggested a tricky hierarchy: the real-life Seal Boy was an extra in scenes starring Evan Peterss prosthetically created Human Lobster. But, midway through the season, Murphy began to shift the spotlight, mining these bodies and personalities for warmth, sex, and tragedy. A sequence in which the lovable Ma Petite stands in a large glass jar, fluttering her fingers like a butterfly, became one of the shows most frightening bits of poetry, like some candied fairy tale from Oscar Wilde. Not surprisingly, Murphys approach has triggered complaints of exploitationand not for the first time. Four of Murphys shows include characters, and actors, who have Down syndrome. On Glee, Artie (played by an able-bodied actor) was in a wheelchair. In Asylum, Chlo Sevigny played a nymphomaniac whose limbs had been amputated. There are many other examplesin fact, there are so many disabled characters in Ryan Murphys series that its impossible to judge these portrayals as a class, although its worth noting that, like Madame Elsa, Murphy is the rare impresario who explores this subject matter at all. Along with the concern that hes a huckster, his shows raise the question of what it means to have stars crip or spack updisdainful terms for able-bodied actors playing disabled characters. This debate, among disability advocates, has analogues to similar issues about cross-racial and transgender roles, from Mickey Rooneys notorious yellow-face, in Breakfast at Tiffanys, to Jared Letos turn as a transgender character, in Dallas Buyers Club. Activists complain that Hollywood stars win Oscars, and score points for bravery, in roles that could go to a disabled actor. They resent the notion that disability itself is a costume. Thats what acting is, of course: its putting on a new identity. But what makes blackface different from drag, or from adding a flipper? In Murphys case, Im no fan of some of the more sentimental disability plots on Glee, or of the dirty jokes given to Becky, a cheerleader with Downgags that felt both queasy and hackish, although no more so than other aspects of the show, in later seasons. Given the rarity of disabled bodies on TV, it can verge on icky (or problematic, to use that awful term of art) to view those few through a fish-eye lens. And while Sarah Paulson is revelatory as the conjoined twinsand I wouldnt want anyone but Lange to play ElsaI found myself rooting for the real disabled to be more than color, or moral coverage, among the able-bodied stars. It was a relief when Fraser was effectively promoted, becoming the heartthrob of a romantic triangle with Elsa and Penny (Grace Gummer), the candy striper he fell for during an opium-addled orgy. Still, the related complaint, that the characters are bad role models, misses the point, from my perspective. Freak Show embodies the philosophy put forth by Fraser in a promotional video for the series: while do-gooders view the sideshow as nefarious, it was, historically, the one place where people with odd anatomies were glamorized, not hidden away. There they could make money, live independently, and find sex and love. The difference between gawking and gazing, fearing and desiring, is not so simple. Murphys freaksboth the organic and the artificial onesarent lessons for the able-bodied, and when the show does veer into pedantry (Youre the real freaks!) its at its weakest. Theyre divas and lovers and revengers and martyrs, who get to experience the extremes of human emotion. There are enough of them so that they cant be only one thing. At the shows best moments, theyre stars, not props. American Horror Story will never be for every viewer; it is, above all else, rude. In the first season, it was rude about a rapist in a black latex gimp mask. In the second season, it was rude about a lampshade made of breast skin. In the third season, it was so rude that it was incoherent. By rude, I dont mean politically incorrect, that inane term for celebrating stupid remarks for their honesty. I mean rude in a grander sense: brazen and crude and funky, open to the ugly as well as to the beautiful, with a vision of the body as a source of both suffering and ecstasy. This sort of rudeness derives from the understanding that, some of the time, a demand for politeness is really a demand to be quiet and disappear. This coarseness gives the show leeway to be, at times, both nasty and funny, making it impossible to distinguish its best from its worstas in a recent episode in which a normal was tattooed, and her tongue forked, against her will, a sequence that felt at once nonsensical and indelible. The series is endlessly, archly quotable: They said I made men ejaculate gold, Elsa reminisces, of her days as a dominatrix in the Weimar Republic. If it risks going too far, thats an American Horror Story tradition, tooits why we watch through our fingers, squinching our eyes. Why go to the circus if theres no chance of blood?"

Coming just two weeks after the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown, the non-indictment of Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner has the feel of a grim serial filled with redundant plot linesa production thatfew of us wish to watch but none of us can avoid, and thata great many are complicit in creating. This is not imaginary. Here is the manwho aspired to become the first black President counselling calm following the acquittal of the officers who shot and killed Sean Bell, an unarmed black man, on the eve of Bells wedding, in New York, in 2006.   Obviously there was a tragedy in New York. I said at the time, without benefit of all the facts before me, that it looked like a possible case of excessive force. The judge has made his ruling, and were a nation of laws, so we respect the verdict that came down.  Here is that same man, having now attained theoffice,counselling calmin the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who killed the seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, another unarmed black man, in Sanford, Florida, in 2012.  The death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions.And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher.   But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.  Two weeks ago, we saw the President, now in the last years of his second term,urge patiencefollowing the non-indictment of Darren Wilson, who shot and killed the eighteen-year-old Michael Brown, who was unarmed.  First and foremost, we are a nation built on the rule of law. And so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jurys to make. There are Americans who agree with it, and there are Americans who are deeply disappointed, even angry. Its an understandable reaction. But I join Michaels parents in asking anyone who protests this decision to do so peacefully.  Last nights statementfrom the President regarding the unprosecuted death of Eric Garner establishes that history does not repeat itself verbatimit usually changes the proper nouns.  Some of you may have heard there was a decision that came out today by a grand jury not to indict police officers who had interacted with an individual [named] Eric Garner in New York City, all of which was caught on videotape and speaks to the larger issues that weve been talking about now for the last week, the last month, the last year, and, sadly, for decades, and that is the concern  of too many minority communities, that law enforcement is not working with them and dealing with them in a fair way.  None of this is President Obamas fault; yet all of it reflects upon him. All of these redundancies indict the anodyne calls for healing that inevitably come in their wake. Here we dont heal. We scar. The stilted conversations that have followedthese tragedies have largely focussed onthe meaning and implications of the nonsensical phrase racial profiling. Nothing better illustrates the slick, manipulative power of euphemism than the fact that our dialogue takes seriously thisnon-term. There is no such thing as racial profilingthere is simply racism. What subsequent action, what logical end, does racial profiling produce that abject racism would not? The supposed definition of racial profilingthat the alleged behavior of any fragment of a population becomes the basis for categorizing it in its sum, that epidermal hues are a valid means of reflexively predicting characteris what we, in more honest moments in our past, simply referred to as racism. If there is any glimmer of interracial unity to be found amid this morass, its found in the fact that black people and whites alike share a common confusion regarding racial profiling. Witness Charles Barkley, opining in favor of the practice. We as black people, we have a lot of crooks. We cant just wait until something like [the Brown shooting] happens. We have to look at ourselves in the mirror, Barkley said in an interview with CNN. There is a reason that they racially profile us in the way they do. Sometimes it is wrong, and sometimes it is right. Fresh from an appearance on Meet the Press, where he charged that black crime, not police brutality, was the real problem, Rudolph Giuliani doubled down on Fox News Sunday:  I do believe that there is more interactionand more unfair interactionamong police officers, white and black, in the black community than in the white community. And I think some of that responsibility is on the police department and on police departments to train their police officers better and to make their police departments much more diversified.   But I think just as much, if not more, responsibility is on the black community to reduce the reason why the police officers are assigned in such large numbers to the black community. Its because blacks commit murder eight times more per capita than any other group in our society.  Theres a smugness that abides in these arguments, which benefit from the conflation of audacity with veracity. Far from being a novel bit of truth-telling, the argument that black crime is the cause of reactionary policing is among the aged and easily refuted clichs of American racial history. The spectre of black criminality justified governmental inaction against lynching duringthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries. When, in 1906, whites began wresting black passengers from streetcars and murdering them in the streets of downtown Atlanta, sparking three days of riots and resulting in dozens of black casualties, a specious wave of black crime was cited as the basis for their actions. In a masterstroke of soothing illogic, segregationists responded to the challenge posed by the civil-rights movement by arguing that black enfranchisement and equality could not be broached as long as Negro crime remained prevalent; they claimed, in short, that ending oppression was contingent upon eliminating the conditions that oppression had in fact produced. This perspective has prevailed and even, from time to time, won converts among African-Americans. Listening to Bill Cosbys responsibility tirades, prior tothis fall, it was possible to believe that black pathology created racism, and that racism could not subside until the pathology was treated. Where whites find a facile absolution in this argument, black people find a simple solution to the miasma of racism, one rooted in the American ideals of self-reliance and determination. The most obvious contradiction to this doctrine of behavior modification is also the one least spoken. Gun homicide hasdeclined by forty-nineper cent since its peak, in 1993, largely because of a decline in homicides perpetrated by black offenders against black victims. This reductionin violent crime over more than two decades has done little to diminish white fear of black criminality, or the potency of black crime in justifying the violation of black rights. Of course, racism, being a superstition, has never been contingent upon facts. That this argument finds particular favor among conservatives is even more preposterous. The idea that the treatment of an individual hinges upon his or her demographic category flies in the face of the doctrine of individual rights central to modern conservatism. African-Americans arethirteen per cent of the population; they are also, horrifyingly, fifty-five per cent of the homicide victims. Whites, meanwhile, are sixty-three per cent of the population, but are only a quarter of the homicide victims. Yet, even if you eliminated every black homicide, the United States would still have amore violentpopulation than Western democracies like the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Based onthe logic of collective responsibility at the heart of racial profiling, we should also be asking white communities what theyve done to deal with their tendency toward violence. The fact thatAmericans die at the hands of other Americans is, one would navelysuspect, an American problembut if those Americans are black, it is considered anything but. This is the alchemy by which racial category takes precedent, yet again, over supposed citizenship. This is the skewed thinking that forms the context in which black people die in the United States. Contrary to the thinking of its most indignant critics, the slogan Black Lives Matter is not an argument that deaths that come at the hands of the police warrant outrage, while those caused by common citizens warrant disregard. Its a statement that these forms of violence reinforce each other in a vicious cycle of human devaluation. If theres particular outrage about police violence, thats because it strips us of the possibility of recourse for other violations. A democracy of grief bindsthose of us who survive people who were violently dispatched from this lifethose who die at the hands of civilians, those who die from the wrongful actions of peopleempowered by the state. The sole difference between these deaths isthat only withthe former do we already know its a crime.

The New Yorker,L,The View from a Bridge,"

 

A plan to turn the old Samaritaine department store into a five-star hotel is at the center of a debate about what Paris is becoming. 
Credit Photograph by Denis Allard / Rea / Redux									 


The Pont des Arts, in Paris, is a steel-and-wood footbridge that connects Left Bank to Rightor, more important to its history and its name, connects the cole des Beaux-Arts, where generations of French artists were told how to draw, to the Louvre, where generations went to find out how to look. It was, until relatively recently, a soulful and solitary passerelle, where one could stand for hours in winter, mostly alone, staring out at the view west toward the older, stone parapet of the Pont Royal and the Eiffel Tower, or east toward Notre-Dame and the sharp-jawed le de la Cit. The view north, toward the Right Bank, remained, until the end of the twentieth century, interestingly mixed, with the newly cleaned Cour Carre of the Louvre straight ahead and, just to the right, the shiplike prow of the Samaritaine department store, proudly flying a couple of pennants from its top. In the past nine years, all that has changed. La Samaritaine, which for almost a century and a half represented the Bonheur des Dames, the happiness of ladies (a title that Zola used ironically, referring to the bourgeois pursuit of material goods in department stores), has closed. The store is emptied, mute and dark and flagless, its fourteen hundred employees gone, as the French luxury conglomerate L.V.M.H. struggles to turn it into a postmodern, glass-encased beacon meant for another kind of woman and another kind of happiness, and so finds itself pitted against preservationists who want neither postmodern glimmer nor luxury glitterwho want, in fact, the same damn happiness for the same damn women. Meanwhile, the Pont des Arts groans beneath the weight of the love locks that have become a rashlike infestation on small Paris bridges in the past few years. Lovers buy cheap padlocks from lock sellers, scribble their initials on the lock, shackle the lock to the bridges railings, and then throw the key into the river. At first, there were a few, then there were a lot, and now they are everywhere, about three-quarters of a million in all, locks shackled to locks shackled to locks shackled to locks, every square inch of the bridge crowded with black initials, brass bodies. Earlier this year, some of the grillwork of the Pont des Arts collapsed under the weight of all that love. The city government has been slow to act, partly for the usual exasperating French bureaucratic reasonsbefore something can actually be done, it must be decided if it is the administrative responsibility of the Prefecture of Police, of the Htel de Ville, or, perhaps, of the Ministry of Cultureand partly out of a genuine bewilderment over how to constrain the passionate gestures of tourists on whose illusions of Paris as the best place to declare ones love the citys economy ever more depends. Two American women, not long ago tourists themselves, have emerged to energize and unleash the popular passion of Paris against the love locks. When Americans visit the bridge now, what there is to see is not the modern and the antique but another opposition: in the distance, the collapse of the grand bourgeois mercantile civilization of Paris and, straight ahead, the excrescences of mass tourism that have replaced it as a central Parisian industry. The view from the footbridge now, in the city that the American women came to savor and stayed to help save, offers a tight knot of paradoxes about the history of Paris, the tempering of glass, and the shackles of love. In the late nineteenth century, Parisian department stores, which began as catchall indoor marketplaces, with individual venders selling drygoods, interbred with the glass exhibition palaces of the period to produce a new building type and a new idea of luxury: all the worlds goods suspended on multiple floors under the natural light of a great, and usually decorated, glass ceiling. La Samaritainethe name derives from a seventeenth-century fountain with a bas-relief of the Samaritan woman that used to stand nearbybegan as one of these closed retail drygoods markets, colonizing, piece by piece, a miscellany of buildings between the Seine and the Rue de Rivoli; Printemps and the Galeries Lafayette emerged as rivals farther back on the grands boulevards. The stores gave an identity to the neighborhood and an idea of popular luxury to the world. La Samaritaine was, by general agreement, the most popular of the great stores, a sort of Macys-plus, if one can imagine Macys on the banks of the Seine with a view of a Gothic cathedral. Then, at the beginning of this new century, the crisis in retailing that has struck the rest of the world struck Paristhe grands magasins had to do battle with what are called here grandes surfaces, the super-big-box retailers that, though kept by law largely to the periphery, are nonetheless good at drawing shoppers in for inexpensive furniture and appliances. Just as the Zola-era department store drove out of business all the small shops of the quartierthe Parisian shopping streets beloved of Americans are a much reduced version of the older kind, with only perishables survivingso the grandes surfaces have been driving out the great department stores. When L.V.M.H. (the name of the conglomerate, overseen by the tycoon Bernard Arnault, combines the initials of Louis Vuitton and Mot Hennessy, the suitcase maker and the champagne house) bought an interest in La Samaritaine, in 2001, it had already turned the Bon March, on the Left Bank, from a bourgeois store to a luxe onefrom an Alexanders to a Bergdorfs. It faced a bigger project with La Samaritaine: to turn the familiar Seine-side building into a five-star hotel, with controlled access to the once famous roof terrace and restaurant. L.V.M.H. approached the Japanese architectural firm of Sanaa. The plan that Sanaa came up with, which also included retail space and low-income housing, was officially inspired by the building complexs original architect, Frantz Jourdain. Conceiving the project in Art Nouveau style, he left intact the various faades of the buildings on the Rue de Rivoli that it was recycled from. The renovation, the company announced, was an opportunity to complete Frantz Jourdains unfinished project to give La Samaritaine a single, immediately recognizable faade in the Rue de Rivoli. The most striking exterior feature of the new architectural model is a billowing, wavelike wall of translucent glass meant to unify the Rue de Rivoli side both by referring to the original verrire roof and by creating a single visual unit that pulls the faades together. This kind of oceanic glass front has become a signature, even a tic, of contemporary French architectureincluding the many glass faades by Jean Nouvel and Christian de Portzamparcs twisted crystal tower at L.V.M.H.s U.S. headquarters, on Fifty-seventh Street in Manhattan. The glass faade suggests, in turn, the long French infatuation with glass wallsprismatic, waving, billowing, or bendingas the symbol and material of modernity or, in this case, postmodernity. Beautiful though the Samaritaine faade promises to be, its critics think that it distracts from the reality that the L.V.M.H. plan, centered on a new hotel, would make the old department store one more luxury destination for Paris transients, rather than a regular retailer for Paris residents. This transformation increased Parisians natural suspicion of Arnaults enterpriseL.V.M.H. having become, to its doubters, a kind of sinister luxury-goods octopus, a monopoly vender of French brands to ascending Asia. When preparatory work began on the Sanaa design, two years ago, preservationists sued. The first level of French magistrates temporarily revoked L.V.M.H.s building permit, then L.V.M.H. appealed, and the case now rests with the Cour dAppel, which is expected to rule in early December. Sanaa won the Pritzker prize, of course, Marie-Line Antonios, of La Samaritaine, says, a little defensively. Spokesmen for La Samaritaine always emphasize the Pritzker, rather in the way that beauty-pageant hosts in America emphasize all the college scholarships the contestants are winning, trying to make it plain that what may look like dazzle is really virtue. Antonios is the directrice gnrale of the Samaritaine project, which means that, right now, she is the executive who is charged with not running a big department store. Originally from Lebanon, she can be found these days at offices on the Left Bank, on the Rue Saint-Andr-des-Arts: a sort of Samaritaine in exile, as she and her team wait for the government to allow them to complete the renovation. She has the weary, guarded look of someone who has been cornered and harried at every turn by self-righteous preservationists and self-important city bureaucrats. L.V.M.H. is the sort of name that is an easy target, she says with a sigh. Everyone feels that L.V.M.H. can do what it wants, when in truth its just the opposite. It would be much easier to do this if it werent L.V.M.H. She explains that the complexity of the project was necessitated by the history of La Samaritaine, assembled, as it was, from bits and pieces of older buildings. On the Rue de Rivoli side, there were seventeenth- and eighteenth-century buildings, but they were all destroyed and adapted to commerce long ago. It is a mlange, with false faades. But the opponents couldnt accept having even those demolished. The patrimony fights against all projects in Paris. She frowns. We obtained the building permit for the program in December, 2012, and we worked for seventeen monthsbut its worse than in New York, the rules, and we had to stop in May, 2014, and then last week we won the right to begin again. But thats a provisional decision. The final one well have in December. So its taken seven years to get the consent, and then have it revoked. But, if all goes well, in 2018 well be finished. Lets remember: everything facing the Seine will be unchangedeverything! Its true that only the mostly nondescript Rue de Rivoli side will be glassed over. But while the nineteenth-century glass was largely functional, letting in light, the new faade is mostly symbolic, trapping light. Not surprisingly, Christian de Portzamparc has published a letter in Le Monde in praise of that aspect of it: A disparate faade on the Rue de Rivoli is transformed and unified into an undulant, diaphanous one, bringing light and loveliness to this part of the street. The only reason to oppose it, he maintained, would be to declare the absolute authority of the pastto declare that everything old is sacred and untouchable and no place at all exists for our time. The world has changed, Antonios goes on, explaining why a popular department store is no longer plausible in central Paris. The problem with grands magasins is the cost of property and personnel, the cost of human resources. The only way to afford those is to make a luxury store. The classic discount stores, the good buy storesthey dont exist anymore. They cant. One of the oddities of the moment is that most Parisians, particularly ones who are hyper-aware of urbanist issues, tend to be merely dismissive of the love locks, even as the locks threaten to pull bridges down into the water and onto the heads of the tourists passing by in boats below. When Le Monde noticed the hard-to-miss pairing at the bridge, it characterized the opposition to the glass faade as a potential tragedy, Paris once again losing out on an architectural advance, with the locks on the bridge more farcical, confronted, quixotically, by two New York women now settled in Paris. We cant be repressive in the City of Love, Bruno Julliard, the first deputy mayor of Paris, blithely announced not long ago, speaking of the love locks. Its an image problem concerning the tourists. It may be best just to wait until the fashion passes. This kind of indifference makes it hard for the two American campaigners, Lisa Anselmo and Lisa Taylor-Huff, to keep their equanimity when you meet them on the Pont des Arts. When they see lock sellers brazenly offering locks to dim-witted tourists, they almost go crazy. The bridge has become even uglier, as the city government, to protect against more love locks, has hurriedly placed plywood panels in front of the railings, while the plywood panels, in turn, are spray-painted with graffiti, recalling to a New Yorker the interiors of subway cars in the early eighties. The two Lisas, the two New York women Le Monde refers to, spent their childhoods in New Jersey, and, far from being just currently settled in Paris, see themselves as settled Parisians. They have been leading the fight against the love locks for almost a year. They run a Web site called Nolovelocks.com (its called that in French, too) and started a petition that has collected ten thousand signatures. By the strangest of chances, they knew each other as teen-agers thirty years ago, in New Jersey. We met doing a play, Lisa Anselmo explains. Were both sort of theatre... Theatre junkies, Lisa Taylor-Huff adds. Theatre gals. We met doing a play in New Jersey. I think I was still in high school. Yeah, I was twenty and you were about sixteen. They both laugh. They then lost touch, until they rediscovered each other, ten years ago, first as lovers of Paris, then as newly minted residents. Lisa Anselmo is more stylish, and has the glossy mane of every other woman one sees eating lunch on the ninth floor at Barneys. Lisa Taylor-Huff is more mature-seemingnot long after her arrival in Paris, she married a Frenchman, met through a Parisian dating network, and is now a stepmother to his three children. The two womens motives for moving to Paris were, and remain, as mixed and mysterious as such motives always are. They came for the life style and the literary possibilities, though both are more narrowly banded than in centuries pastnot absinthe and the avant-garde but friends and croissants and blogs and cafs. Buy the print  It is not entirely a self-sustaining emotion. Like many Americans with dreams of Paris who confront Paris, they have found that they are living in a grouchy, heavily overadministered country, where everyone is socialized to be negative in the first instance, and where the small details of life are made as wrenchingly difficult as possiblethough no more for newcomers than they are for the natives, which, of course, helps account for their grouchiness. They wish the French had the same investment in Frenchness that they do. Theirs is actually larger, being chosen, while that of the French is merely passive. We both are powerhouse gals who have marketing backgrounds, Lisa Anselmo says. Im a creative director as well, but what would be more complicated for some people was common nature for us. In the beginning, we took a lot of heat, she adds. It was brutal, the hate mail and the bad language. We would take turns weeping. And they would come at us on our individual blogs and attack us. Oh, Americans always sticking their noses into other peoples business, the other Lisa says. And from Americans, too. Americans are always inserting themselves into places they dont belongand Im thinking, Well, isnt that what putting a lock there is doing? It took adjusting what we said in interviews to start making it clear that yes, were Americans, but we live here, we pay taxes, my husband is French. Practitioners routinely speak of the love locks as a Parisian tradition that goes back five hundred years. In fact, the locks were probably the spawn of a 2006 Italian romance, I Want You, which presents a scene of locking and shackling and throwing. Despite all the campaigning that the Lisas have done, and the ten thousand signatures on the online petitiondespite appearances on LCI, the French CNN, and interviews with Le Figaro and Librationthe thing goes on: The Kardashians did it on their show! Basketball wives did it on their show! Its a disease thats infecting the great cities of the world, Lisa TaylorHuff reflects later, over a glass of Lillet at a caf in the courtyard of the Louvre. Paris is also a museum, but its still a living museum. People live here, we have our lives here, were educating our kids here, they want to be able to go out in the public spaces. Were raising a bunch, and when I think of my husbands three kidstwo of them are in university now and one is still just in middle schoolwhat kind of future are they going to have if all their public spaces and their heritage are destroyed and degraded because of tourism? Why are we selling out to tourism? The two Lisas vociferousness is produced partly by the perpetual immigrants need to prove that she is not merely a newcomer but has transferred allegiances even more passionately, along with residencethe same syndrome that, in its darker corners, made the Italian-Corsican Napoleon the most passionate Frenchman alive. If you were born within sight of the Pont des Arts and see it ruined, you merely change your route; there are lots of other bridges to cross. And then every city with mass tourism makes an implicit compact with tourists, which involves certain territorial concessions. No New Yorker would be really indignant to hear of an insult to the urban fabric at the South Street Seaport. Changing the Guard at Buckingham Palace is a moving and entertaining ritual, and the Tower of London a fascinating historical citadel. No real Londoner would be caught dead near either. Mass tourism doesnt just overcharge its locales; it devours its objects. Our conversion experience to cities inevitably alienates us from the thing that first converted us. The two Lisas have a partial sense of this irony. If Parisians, or Venetians, tried to distinguish between mere tourists and true travellers and adopted visitors, they would never stop. Better to make two lumpsThem and Us, and stick to the Us places while surrendering the Them spots. Where the people who put up love locks insist that people have always been putting up love locks, Parisians pretend that the Pont des Arts is the kind of place you would always have wanted to avoid because it attracted the kind of people who put up love locks. What drives those who oppose the new Samaritaine, even as they mostly ignore the love locks? The absolute authority of the past? Or a distaste for putting a luxury hotel for rich transients in place of an old department store for middle-class Parisians? Alexandre Gady is the president of the chief institutional opponent of the project, the century-old and grandly named Socit pour la Protection des Paysages et de lEsthtique de la France. From the societys magazineit is filled with decorous views of the French countryside primly bordered by dated typographyone would expect an old French reactionary of a specific predictable sort: gray-suited, silver-haired, with matching metal-rimmed glasses, a decoration in his buttonhole, and a fierce, intelligent suspicion in his eyes of America, the modern and meretricious. In fact, Gady, only forty-six, is perhaps the preminent historian of Paris of his generationwith books and articles on the evolution of the Marais and the social life of Place des Victoires, and the top position in architectural history at Paris IV, the old Sorbonne. He is open-collared and good-humored. Like the two Lisas and, indeed, Mme. Antonios, he came to his love for Paris from elsewherethough his elsewhere was a nearby industrial village. Can you believe it? he says. I grew up a few kilometres away, and throughout my childhood I never came to Paris. Not once. Oh, exactly oncewith my school, on a big bus to see the Louvre museum! My mother hated Paris. She had a phobia about the crowds and the cars. It is bizarre. I resemble a provincial of the nineteenth century who discovered Parisexcept that I came not from Toulouse but from a few kilometres away. Over lunch in a caf in the Seventh Arrondissement, he is relaxed and smiling and immediately assents to the notion that Paris risks becoming Venetian if it resists new building; he agrees that some of the most successful examples of urbanism in modern Parisian historythe Eiffel Tower and the Beaubourg are twowere seen as discordantly avant-garde when they began. What is it, exactly, that he, and the organization he leads, objects to? First, there is, as he cheerfully admits, something logical and vocational about the protest: basically, a society like his is supposed to oppose projects like this one. If it was his mtier to support such projects, he would. But his real objections involve a complicated argument about the history of Paris. Its an argument that would touch the edge of perversity if it were not so beautifully articulated, at length, as paradox. It is that any energy spent on renovating, improving, or changing inner Paris is merely a diversion from the real needs of the city. It is not just that the wrong side may win the argument. It is the wrong argument to be having. Thats the heart of the problem, Gady says. As a historian, I need to have a long-term vision, and the problem with France is that its a country that loves history but has a very weak historical memoryand its lites, in particular, are mediocre, in the sense that they have no capacity for projection, for seeing whats happened or whats coming. The major problem for Paris is the exhaustion of land. Paris is one of the most ancient capitals in the world, after Rome. We have a dense history thats very, very oldand, whats more, intimately linked to the construction of the nation-state of France. The Capetians chose Paris as a capital, even though the secret truth is that Paris was never a very good choice for a capital. Its much too far norththe Germans got here twice in fifteen days! But in the twelfth century, in the Middle Ages, when Rome was a mediocre village, Paris was already a university town and an industrial center. At its height, it had three hundred thousand inhabitantsthats bigger than any city in France today, save five! It was a populated, extremely densely occupied city. Travellers wrote then that it was dangerous to cross the streets because of the traffic! And heres the central thingthe city has never really grown. Paris is a very tiny surface, and thats the core secret of it. Los Angeleswell, try to walk that city on foot. Berlin, too, a city of gigantic blocks. In the nineteenth century, at the moment when Berlin and London and New York acted by annexing the suburbs and smaller cities around them, we turned inwardwe concentrated on the Paris of the center. And so Parisits beautiful. But its a dolls house! And thats one reason the Parisian lite is so conservative. They live in the dolls house. They go to the same schoolsin the center of Paris. They live in the same apartmentsin the center of Paris. The lyse Palace, the Htel Matignon are in the center. So all they see is that. The blindness of the lites is to reproduce a model of returning to the center, always back to the center, and thats a model that cant be maintained. This, in his view, is the true evil of the Samaritaine project. Once again, we see the same fundamental errorwell treat central Paris as a bijou, and let it be surrounded by these dubious zones we call the banlieues with people we dont much like. I know what the banlieues areI live in one of them. Gady has built up to his real provocation. It is not that we should be doing this or thatwe should not be doing anything in central Paris. Not that it is a bad plan in itself, but any plan devoted to central Paris is a bad plan, a diversion from the need of the city to grow outward. La Samaritaine is a choice for the hyper-luxe in a hyper-central neighborhood, decorated with a gesture of architecture. And then, he says, there are the rules: Its a quartier entirely protected by lawI didnt make it so; the state didentirely protected, architecturally finished, with no space and strict rules. And if you or I asked to do what L.V.M.H. wants to, wed be told, Sorry, sir, its forbidden. One almost has the sense that Gady would be content to see La Samaritaine remain shutteredsooner, at least, than see it become one more glittering gewgaw in the dolls house. Paris, central Paris, is a finished city, he says, meaning one not in need of improvementbut also, perhaps, one without a plausible future. A finished city, polished to a gloss, is also a finished city, incapable of new experience. He strongly suspects, in any case, that though he and the preservationists have won the first skirmish they will lose the war. Well see what happens, but L.V.M.H.... He trails off. Asked about the love locks, Gady shakes his head. Theyre hideous, he says. But there the solution is so easy! Just get rid of the metal grilles and replace them with plaquessmooth panels to which no lock can be attached. He shrugs, unaware that the two Lisas have been fighting for this simple solution for a year, to no avail. The love locks, for Gady, seem part of the same density of inner Paris that magnetically draws in tourists as it does politicians; the overloading of the bridge is just a kind of poor mans version of the overloading of the entire area. Inner Paris has been polished to a point of hyper-attractiveness, whether in a luxe form meant to draw oligarchs to the five-star hotels there (after yesterdays five-star hotel in Dubai and before tomorrows five-star hotel in London) or in the kitsch form exemplified by the groaning weight of tourist relics. Central Paris has become not a window onto the world but a vitrine with exhibits inside, some fine, some squalid, all finished. As if by some principle of civic equilibrium, while Mme. Antonios waits patiently on the Left Bank for the government to decide whether L.V.M.H. can or cannot have its vast, seven-story glass curtain, the city government stripped away the locks from one section of the bridge and ceded to the two Lisas and their French followers three small test panels of glass, three feet by five feet each, for the Pont des Arts. The three experimental panels make it almost impossible to attach a lock, and each has different qualities of scratch resistance and durability. The new glass panneaux, or windows, are there only as a tentative experiment. Just seeing those new panels, just to have that view restored, its hard not to break into tears, Lisa Anselmo says. And you can sit on the bench and look at those panels and feel like you can look at the Eiffel Tower and it looks the way its supposed to! Lisa Taylor-Huff agrees. All over Paris right now, there are posters for the French singer Vronique Sanson, advertising concerts of songs from what are called, portentously, Les Annes Americainesher American years. It is fair to say that no American has any idea that Vronique had American yearsalthough she did, and was married to Stephen Stills for a little while. It doesnt matter. The idea of her Americanness appeals to Parisians, as the abstract idea of becoming Parisian appeals to Americans. To become some other thing, you have to not be that thing in the first place, and, if you are that thing, then it is hard for you to really believe that anyone else can become it, since the essence of the thing is having been it all along. La Samaritaine, now no longer quite part of Paris, cannot be returned to Paris as a luxury hotel. Two powerhouse New Jersey gals from marketing backgrounds can save the bridge from the love locksbut the French are skeptical that they can restore it to Paris, and the bridge has to be restored to Paris, made part of the Parisian sense of Us, before it can be returned to Paris. Historians in France like to say that when lieux de mmoires, places of memory, are in conflict they become inflamed; the truth is that when sites are in conflict they mostly disappear from view. They get covered over by hoardings, and shame and scaffolding, locked to alien loves. The view through the three tentatively installed glass panneaux not only briefly removes the visual noise of the love locks but, in its serenity, restores the innocence of the view, so that everything once again seems simply Parisian, and the people in the boats going by below less like endangered tourists corralled into movable pens and more like pilgrims to the medieval city, seeking its grace. Glass is clear."
The New Yorker,L,A Risky Novel of Seduction and Betrayal,"

 

Harvey, in excavating a love triangle, explores the strange elasticity of time. 
Credit Illustration by Riccardo Vecchio									 


The odds are powerfully stacked against Samantha Harveys third novel, Dear Thief (Atavist): sometimes you feel that the author has enjoyed building a trembling wall of them. Her novel takes the form of a long letter, written by a woman in middle age, to her childhood friend, and so most of the narration languishes in the corridor of the second-person singular. The friend (the thief of the books title) disappeared a decade and a half ago, and so the narrator does much reminiscing, with the danger that the novel drifts fairly often into the pressureless zones of retrospect. And the narrators lost friend was a character, a large personality remembered, with loathing and love, for her enigmatic singularity: so, most perilously, Harveys novel must work to convince us that this vague you of the narrators letter deserves her extravagant reputation and the time spent recalling her. The book is sometimes precious or whimsical, and can be frustratingly diaphanous. It has nerves of silk; it could probably do with more robustness, and a bit of comedy. But Dear Thief is a beautiful, tentative success, a novel with no interest in conformity. Harveys book is propelled not by the usual structures of novel writing but by the quality of its authors mind, by the luminousness of her prose, and by an ardent innocence of speculation that is rare in contemporary fiction. We follow Harveys narrator, as she pushes her way through her novel-size letter, because we can see that she has somewhere to go, and because we sense that she is trying to figure out exact answers to wide questions. It is a strange and exhilarating journey, unlike anything I have recently encountered. You can get an idea of the novels rich peculiarity from its first sentence, which will strike some readers as fey or arch, but which its narrator (who remains nameless) offers quite matter-of-factly: In answer to a question you asked a long time ago, I have, yes, seen through what you called the gauze of this life. The narrator replies to her old friends remembered question by telling us about the night her grandmother died, during the long, hot English summer of 1976, when the narrator was twenty-four. Within a paragraph or two, the reader senses an attentive purity in the narrators prose. She seems alert to everything: the feathered breaths of her grandmother, how her exhales were smooth and liquid, which seems to me now the surest sign of a lifes exitwhen the act of giving away air is easier than that of accepting it; the way the dying womans skin has flattened a toneand I mean it this way, like a piece of music gone off-key. The scene and the location are somewhat magical. The grandmothers house is by the Thames, very east in the city, near the Isle of Dogs, and not far from the point at which the river, wide now, becomes the seaa thousand pale horses frothing at the bit. To pass the time, the narrator wanders down to the river, where she finds a collection of bones on the shore; when she returns, she discovers, as she expected to, that her grandmother has died, and feels this end to be calm and right. She suffers no grief, because life as Id always known it shows itself now as only the negative space made by a much vaster reality. She thinks of her grandmother, fundamental and as still as a root, and it seems senseless to say that she is dead, just as senseless as it is to say I myself am alive. In this respect, the narrator says, she has seen through the gauze of this life. Its a risky way to begin a novel, to throw us head first into death and sententiousness, metaphysics and nameless characters (the grandmother has no further role in the book). But Harveys novel proceeds in this spirit of continual lawlessness. The gauze of this life is just the kind of phrase, we learn, that the narrators friend would usechallenging, glamorously pretentious, annoying, at once acute and vague. The two women grew up together in the English countryside, in Shropshire. The narrators friend is named Nina, though she is here nicknamed Butterfly, because, one supposes, she is lovely, and comes and goes in apparently random flights. Butterfly is one of those people whose role on earth is to be talked about. As the narrator gradually reveals, her strange friend stood out in the England of their nineteen-sixties childhood (this mannered land that was too small for you): a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania who was brought to England as a baby; an androgynous beauty, with a strong nose and narrow hips; languorous, dangerous, self-absorbed, brilliant, mystical (she liked quoting from the Upanishads). When she was younger, Butterfly showed little interest in men, and would respond to their overtures with a placid Thank you, no, and the lighting of a cigarette. When they mocked her and called her a dyke, she would dumbfoundingly quote Lorca at them: Poetry was your only response to anything they did or said and you used it as wastefully as somebody emptying a cartridge into grey sky. The poems would leave indents of silence, like hammer marks on metal. She had an air of magnificent poverty. She looked out of place almost anywhere substantial. She was mercurial. One day, she might seem pale and plain, and we leave you alone in the veil of smoke that makes you look like a sullen bride, bored at her own wedding table. On another, she has painted her eyelids purple or orange, or is wearing a mans purple trousers. For her twenty-first birthday, she was given a cream-colored shawl, and seems not to have taken it off for the next decade. When the narrator last saw her friend, in 1986, she was still wearing it, but it was dirty and torn in one place, so that the white of Butterflys shoulder came through, like some fallen rampart, betraying a loss of dignity far greater than if you had stood naked in public. People who get talked about, who are remembered as figures, tend to be memorable either for some large achievement or for scandalously doing nothing very muchfor just being. Butterfly falls into the second category, and Harvey, again setting herself a difficult task, skillfully captures the friends enraging passivity. Was she selfish? No, the narrator says; she might have been fundamentally selfless, by which I mean somebody who lies low like a card in a pack, until the cards are dealt. There are cards that are good news and cards that are bad news, but Butterfly was neither intrinsically good nor bad. She is just offered up, and played or not. Think of it as one less thing to worry about.Buy the print  It is this terrible neutrality to which the narrator returns again and again, and which provides the novels catalyst. The narrator, who is around fifty and is writing this letter in 2001 and 2002, remembers a woman who could never quite be graspedshe would disappear and emerge years later, and give no coherent account of where she had been. She left England, or so it appears, in 1973, when she was twenty-one, and turned up at the narrators house nine years later, asking if she could stay for a month or two. The narrator was now living with a husband, Nicolas, and a young son, Teddy. (After a spell in London, they had moved back to the countryside that she grew up in.) They take Butterfly in, of course, and she stays for three years. Butterflys failure to explain or apologize is characteristic. Less expected, perhaps, are the needle marks on her arm. Butterfly has become a committed, if discreetly functional, drug-taker. And something else happens during her three-year visit, something Harvey has been slyly preparing, with various hints, a vague sense of unease, and the slow revelation of the narrators possessive anger. Butterfly worms her way into her friends marriage and breaks it up. The passive-aggressive insinuation culminates in a scene in Spain, when the narrator catches her friend and her husband having sex, a rare moment of narrative conventionality in the book (which is not necessarily the weaker for it). Earlier, less conventionally, in a passage of subtle indirection, the narrator first realized what was afoot. Butterfly is walking with her friend; she is wearing Nicolass cast-off trousers, and the narrator is surprised by how well they fit her. Always ready with an opinion, Butterfly announces, in her airy and pretentious way, that religions have trinities because a triangle is the holiest and most elegant of things; with two lines you can only create two lines, but with three you can create a shape. That is why three is a transformative number. It is the moment when the narrator, always weirdly tolerant of her friend, first feels threatened and outmaneuvered: You were going to work your way into my marriage and you were going to call its new three-way shape holy, and I, pinned like a snared bird to one corner of a triangle, would have to watch it happen. (Harvey has said that her novel is indebted to Leonard Cohens song Famous Blue Raincoat, also about a love triangle, and also written as a letter to the person responsible for the marital destruction.) This breakage is at the heart of the book, and explains not only the narrators obsessive involvement in her lost friend but also, perhaps, Butterflys long disappearance. Yet Harvey is less interested in the dramatic formula of betrayal than in making use of the novels essayistic form to range widely, sometimes concretely, sometimes abstractly. She has been compared to Virginia Woolf, but I was at moments reminded of Marilynne Robinson, particularly of the near-pedagogical or sermonizing rhetoric of Housekeeping. Harvey, who was born in Kent in 1975, has a degree in philosophy, and you sense a continuous pressure of intellectual inquiry, in sentences that are rich but always lucid. As in her exquisite first novel, The Wilderness (2009), which is narrated by a man who is suffering from Alzheimers, Harvey explores the strange elasticity of time, and our relation to it: how we might carelessly let years go by without self-assertion or resistance; how we wantonly reshape the past; how we live too much in the past (and yet never enough to satisfy us, because it has so painfully gone). The narrator is fascinated by Butterflys canny passivity, but she is also bewildered by her own. Once she saw what was coming, why did she do nothing to stop it? Was it because she was foolishly tolerant, or because she knew that she was witnessing her friends steady downfall? (Wherever Butterfly now is, she is not there with Nicolas: the two were barely together as lovers.) And what of her own downfallwhy did she acquiesce in that, colluding in her own loneliness? (She has been separated from Nicolas for fifteen years, and doesnt appear to see a great deal of her grownup son.) The narrator now works in a nursing home, which forces her to reflect on the shape a life takes, on everything that is evidently beyond our control. She doesnt understand time, she insists, which is to say that she doesnt really understand life: You would think that living is a kind of scholarship in time, and that the longer we live the more expert we become at coping with it, in the way that, if you play tennis enough, you get used to coping with faster and faster serves. Instead I find that the longer I live the more bemused I become, and the more impenetrable the subject shows itself to be. I sit on a heap of days. Sitting on her heap of days (a wonderfully Biblical image), she goes back in time, she recollects, and, in a striking inversion of the usual wisdom, phrased with Harveys wistful elegance, she posits that the past is where our true potential lies: There is freedom there; there is always freedom in the past. The self you left behind lives in endless possibility. The older you get, the bigger and wilder the past becomes, a place that can never again be tended and which is therefore prone to that loveliness that happens on wastelands and wildernesses, where grass has grown over scrap metal and wheat has sprung up in cracks between concrete and there is no regular shape for the light to fall flat on, so it vaults and multiplies and you want to go there. You want to go there like you want to go to a lover. This runs the risk of making Dear Thief sound more abstract, or just more essayistic, than it is. One of the regular rewards of its prose is its careful attention to the worldfrom the reproachful magnetism between two tango dancers to the way a snowflake lands on a windowpane, in that ludicrous wet collapse that removes all the mystery. Harvey exactly sketches a Spanish bullfightthe moment, near the end, when bull and matador recognize each other, and then the moment when that mutual animal recognition is destroyed: When the bull finally realizes that the man is cruel, there is no longer recognition. The bull is not cruel; why does the man have to be.... The bull staggers and drops like a rock into its short shadow, and is dragged away to music. There is a transporting description of fishing for mussel pearls in the Scottish Highlands: Often in the Highlands the very early mornings are clear and blue and then become gradually duller as if, I always thought, our human presence clouded the landscape like breath clouds glass. Harveys rarity can be found in that last sentence, in her ability to move from the ordinary to the speculative, her dance to and from the metaphysical. There is steady pleasure and consolation in this for the reader, if not reliably for the books troubled characters. Even as it tells its tale of determinism and fatality, this remarkable novel asserts its own curious freedoms."

Olena Kalytiak Davis writes poetry that can be at once tawdry and oddly pure. 
Credit Illustration by Patrick Morgan									 


The poet Olena Kalytiak Daviss new book, her third, is The Poem She Didnt Write and Other Poems. The title echoes, even as it undermines, an old formula that seems to have gone out of favor: Eliots The Waste Land and Other Poems, Yeatss The Green Helmet and Other Poems, Ginsbergs Howl and Other Poems, Plaths The Colossus and Other Poems all come readily to mind, along with many slim but stately volumes before them. These titles conjure a world in which poetry was a game played across the ages, masterpiece versus masterpiece. The struggle was dynastic; the combatants were male, unless, like Plath, they had internalized (in Plaths case, tragically) the patrilineal rules for advancement. Anthologies were printed and syllabi distributed, and so the canon was formed. Poets live casually among masterpieces of their art. The volume of Stevens propping up the window, the translation of Catullus serving as a coaster, the waterlogged Dickinson: these are features of any writers environment, and the thought of joining them both inspires and blocks. And so Daviss submissions to the canon are anti-submissions; her title poem fantasizes a work that wasnt/influenced by homer or blake or yeats and contained no anxiety and hadnt even heard of / louise glck franz wright billy (budd) collins. The poem she didnt write isnt The Poem She Didnt Write: of that imagined, nonexistent poem, Davis informs us that she did not read [it] to anyone and did not send it out for publication. That poem prempts its own rejection by never existing in the first place; it is the recessive version of Daviss canonical aspirations, whose namesake will carry its torch. Daviss professed unworthiness is one of many tricky manifestations of her ambition. She is the rare poet who has made underproduction an aspect of her glamour. Since 1997, she has published only two full-length books and a chapbook, whose contents are reprinted here. The poems can be tawdry, but any art so fixated on its imperfections comes off as weirdly pure. Maybe some of this is geographical. Poets on the usual coasts can keep themselves busy inside the panopticon, never far from a bar reading or a teaching gig. Davis, who was born in 1963, in Detroit, to Ukrainian parents, has for years lived in and around Anchorage, Alaska, where she works as an attorney. From the evidence of her poems, she is a single mother who drivesor once drovea 1995 red toyota 4-runner with racing stripe, listens to loud Dylan on the way to pick up her kids, falls in and out of love, and, above all, reads. The poems are paved with outbursts and literary touchstones. They feel like quickies, rough liaisons where sex meets books, sometimes, as in Francesca Says More, unhappily: that maiden thump was book on floor, but does it really matter who kissed who first or then who decided to go further? lower? faster? naturally, we took turns on top. now here, now there, and up and downonce it started no one even thought to think to stop. so, we have holes inside our souls, but mustnt we begin by filling others? god gave us lips and hands and parts that cannot possibly be saved for prayer. nor by. i will not name name, claim fame by how well or who i fucked or why, it happens all the time. and its you, white pilgrim, whom next galehot seeks.  fuck. we didnt read again for weeks.  The speaker is a contemporary version of Dantes tragic heroine Francesca, condemned to suffer in Hell with her lover, Paolo. The forma form that Dante helped to inventis the sonnet, here reduced to its rudiments: fourteen lines, a rumor of pentameter, a tart couplet at the close. The poem, one of Daviss many shattered sonnets, as she has called them, draws these lines in order to color outside of them; her small i isnt so much an homage to Cummings as it is a nod to text messages and Gchat, forms of written communication that operate under the conditions of instantaneousness previously reserved for speech. It was reading about the romance of Lancelot and Guinevere, as Dante tells us, that got Francesca in trouble to begin with; it was reading Francescas story about the dangers of reading that resulted in the books maiden thump as it was unceremoniously kicked off the bed and replaced by the book Davis wrote. The Poem She Didnt Write is a breakup book, full of the kinds of invective and taunts honed by a person who has spent, as all of us have now spent, infinite hours online. Its complex tones arise from the poets wanting equally to seduce and to repel a lover whose deepening silence only provokes rhetorical escalation. The effect can be like reading e-mails in someones drafts folderbut who wouldnt want to read Daviss drafts? Do you know how many men would paykilldie/for me to suck their cock? fuck, she writes, leaving the triple verb just as it is, as though waiting for the finished missive to make the choice. Power, especially sexual power; the pleasures and risks of debasement; candor and the fakery that passes for it; wildness and the social vacuum it shattersthese are Daviss preoccupations. Sex displaces reading, kicking the book off the bed. But, just as often, reading, by providing one kinky scenario after another, displaces sex, as in Robert Lowell: The dream, I dont remember how it went, For I dont really dream or count or know Why Robert Lowell: the only poet shade sent To acknowledge my cool ambition, light my cigarette.  The poem seems angled for stateliness, with its regular meters and debonair rhymes. Lowell, who more or less invented confessional poetry, is, of course, the very model of male charisma and its excesses. But things rapidly, thrillingly unravel. In the next stanza, Davis is a sexy shambles, her T-shirt emblazoned with a phrase from Lowells late poem Epilogue: This is the decade of aughts and oughts And I am still naught. I am forty. In a tight Tshirt over my small ignoble breasts reading: ALLS MISALLIANCE.  Lowells patents are everywhere (These are the tranquilized fifties/and I am forty, he writes, in Memories of West Street and Lepke), though Daviss adaptations gut and rebuild them: a woman who is forty in the two-thousands is naught in the decade of aughts and oughts. The poem drifts from its altitudes down into the scuffed, actual life it briefly sought to transcend. What makes Daviss work exciting is the feeling it conveys of being full-famished. /Famished-full, an emotional state with aesthetic ramifications: it sends us ricocheting from line to line and poem to poem looking for sustenance. Heres reason to think that authentic pining in poetry, though hard to come by, is probably necessary for any poet who wishes to become classic. Daviss successive impulses, often cancelling one another, imply a poem full of fresh starts summarily abandoned, as in The Lyric I Drives to Pick Up Her Children from School: A Poem in the Postconfessional Mode. The title mocks the language of M.L.A. panels and doctoral theses: if this lyric I is, as the theory heads say, a construct, a fiction, whats it doing wearing her tight jeans, her big boots, her puffy parka? i feels the power of being a single mom in a red truck. i knows it is not enough power. i thinks i am the man, i suffered, i was there. i is almost broke, but i thinks i live more in a continuous present that i enjoy. i thinks amor fati. i notices the chugach mountains. i notices the chugach mountains sometimes look good and sometimes bad. i remembers that yesterday the chugach mountains looked desolate and dirty and roadblocky. i notices the chugach mountains look particularly beautiful today covered in sun and snow. i almost thinks bathed in sun and snow but stops herself. i feels that i can maybe find, really start, really finish her sex poem tomorrow.  When you say these lines aloud, you become the I, just as Davis, repeating Whitmans lines, becomes the man who can say I suffered, I was there; and yet you also experience the jolt of disagreement between subject and verb, since I is here treated as third person. The effect is more like being an actor in a play, moved by the gusts of emotion that move your character, than like being a member of the audience. This discomfiting proximity, this unsought intimacy, is the fundamental pleasure of poetry. Daviss poems plunge us right into the heart of it. The medium of poetry isnt language, really; its human loneliness, a loneliness that poets, having received it themselves from earlier poets, transfer to their readers. Like bees in a honeycomb, writers and readers experience isolation and solitude communally and collaboratively. This is what Harold Bloom speaks of when, in a remark that Davis quotes, he says that poets create an otherness such that loneliness is created and alleviated at once. Writing a poem, you create that vivid otherness; reading one, you re-create it in your own person. These two lonely souls, writer and reader, are bound to one another. They can be miles or centuries apart, but in Daviss book the passage between them sees some heavy traffic. Her final poem, a single couplet called Threshold, invites us to cross it: what i should of softly sweetly surely said:/o wingd boy, come read with me in bed."
The New Yorker,L,Tables for Two: Turntable Retro Bar & Restaurant Mad for Chicken,"

We need to talk about chicken. Not the buttermilk-crusted crags and crevices of the South but the Korean variety: smooth, with a slight shimmer, resembling a lunar landscape, or at least what the moon looks like from Earth. Amid a crowded field in the shadow of the Empire State Building, theres a particularly fine rendition of Korean fried chicken at the lavishly named Turntable Retro Bar & Restaurant Mad for Chicken, part of a mini-chain that originated in Flushing. Like many of Koreatowns best establishments, its on the second floor of a bleak office building. After eight, a d.j. in a glass booth makes his presence known, loudly, to all the restaurants customers, many of whom have enthusiastically embraced the truth that fried chicken is a drunk food par excellence. If thats the route youd like to take, do not let the long list of signature Martinis distract you. One of themthe Earl Gray Twistcomes with a Mighty Leaf teabag awkwardly dangling off the side; another, the Blueberry Martini, lists sour mix as an ingredient. When the most drinkable of the cocktails is made with Cognac (Men in Cognac, which sounds like a misandrists excellent revenge plot), its an indicator that soju or beer is best. There are plenty of other things to avoid, too: undercooked kimchi pancakes, a Mexican-style appetizer of mozzarella-covered corn, tables of men with rolled-up shirtsleeves ordering shots and talking about a bungee-jumping video they posted on Facebook. And although the menu has all the Korean dishes Americans might expect, none are exceptional. After everyones poked their chopsticks around in a dish of reliably chewy rice cakes with bulgogi, the chicken is eaten swiftly and in silenceor as quietly as possible when its oldies night and the d.j.s got to the sotto-voce part of Total Eclipse of the Heart. There are many reasons why Korean fried chicken is such a superbly satisfying eating experience. Fingers arent spoiled, because the sauce is lightly brushed on, and only after the chicken is cooked. The meat remains juicy, because the bird is cooked at a lower temperature than its American brethren. The chicken is dipped in a very finely ground flour, and, as a result, the shell is paper-thin, almost translucent; it is pierced, not shattered, on first bite. Because the skin and flesh are cooked evenly, the disconcerting layer of fat in between is exorcised. Although Turntable offers a soy-and-garlic sauce, the hot and spicy is the main event, with a slow and subtle burn. A plate of wings with a side of pickled daikon radish is the ideal mix of salty and sour, crunchy and chewy. Human tastebuds are powerless against such a deeply addictive sequence. All there is to do is add soju, and repeat."
The New Yorker,L,The Wu-Tang Clans A Better Tomorrow,"

 

No other hip-hop group has had such a combination of the dodgy concept called street cred and unapologetically poetic, emotional writing.

The most surprising thing about A Better Tomorrow, the latest album from New Yorks Wu-Tang Clan, is not that it is generally strong but that the fractious nine-person group ended up making any kind of recording together at all. For its previous studio album, 8 Diagrams (2007), Wu-Tang Clan ended up touring without its founder, the RZA, who had produced most of the album. RZA, meanwhile, conducted a solo tour of his own, at the same time. By doing more visible work, including writing soundtracks for Quentin Tarantino, RZA had alienated his own group. As he told me, referring to Raekwon, a core member of the clan, He said I was a hip-hop hippie with a guitar. Hippie tag aside, this isnt unfair. RZA said that he wrote many of the tracks for A Better Tomorrow on guitar, first, later voicing the compositions with samples or other instruments. But the Wu still mostly sounds like the Wu, and a newcomer who has never encountered the most famous band from Staten Island would do fine to start here. The Wu-Tang Clans long career mirrors the comic books and kung-fu flicks that its members grew up loving: colorful and intense, and longer on respect than on widespread mainstream acceptance. Like cheap Canal Street mixtapes and kung-fu DVDs, Wu-Tang has never had enormous commercial success, even at the height of the CD era. In twenty years and five albums, the group has sold only a little more than six million records, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Wu-Tang was formed in and around Staten Islands public Stapleton and Park Hill Houses, in the late eighties, pulling in additional rappers who lived in Brooklyn. By 1992, a member named GZA had released an album, under the name the Genius, on Cold Chillin Records, and his cousin, the eventual bandleader RZA, had released a goofy single on Tommy Boy, as Prince Rakeem. But, in the early nineties, RZA plotted a new direction that drew on martial-arts epigrams (Wu-Tang was the best sword style. And with us, our tongue is our sword, he explains in The Wu-Tang Manual), chess strategy, and practices derived from the teachings of the Five Percent Nation, a group formed in 1963 by Clarence (13X) Smith, a student minister at the Nation of Islams Temple Number Seven, in Harlem. The bands dbut, Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers, in 1993, fell into a category of hip-hop that has since been called boom bap: slow, aggressive drum samples matched with lyrical dexterity. But nothing was quite like Wu-Tang records. RZAs production was dirtier and weirder than that of his peers, and he was teamed with an uncannily talented array of m.c.s with divergent styles. No other band has had such a combination of that dodgy cultural concept known as street credall its members are from rough neighborhoods, and most are veterans of jail stintsand unapologetically twisty, emotional, poetic writing. Wu-Tang Clan albums feel overloaded in every sense. Other groups, like Public Enemy, had complex, advanced aesthetics, but Wu-Tang Clan was the only one that could switch from discussing Eastern philosophy to telling stories about police harassment to debating the merits of different coats. Around the same time as Wu-Tangs dbut, smoother sounds from the West Coast and the South took over the charts, and havent let go. But the Wu-Tang influence is now being heard in a new generation, with m.c.s like Action Bronson and Joey Bada$$, who are heavy on aggression and intricate wordplay, and uninterested in simple, chanted hooks. Theres no pretending that this is the same collection of rappers who entered the public consciousness with a thundering chain of threats and compressed drums, on the single Protect Ya Neck. A Better Tomorrow ventures into slightly obvious inspirational talk (Never let go of your mind, it is a terrible thing to waste, to lose, but its very hard to find, GZA raps, on Never Let Go); what sounds like an unironic sample of Feelings, on Felt; and, on Miracle, an invocation of familiar modern rock that has an unmiraculous effect. For most of the album, though, the band is typically prolix, haughty, and immersed in its own world of slang. There are live drums and other traces of RZAs work as an m.c. and a producer outside hip-hop, with acts such as the Black Keys and James Blake, but nothing that will make you question whom youre hearing. Indeed, the drum samples in the song Pioneer the Frontier were also used in Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers. There are snippets from kung-fu movies scattered throughout the album, a device that was RZAs initial watermark as a producer. And although the group has been more flux than stasis in its career, every m.c. is as strong as he was twenty years ago. On Mistaken Identity, over a live band playing vaguely sinister funk, Method Man starts off a rattling sixteen-bar verse with an open acknowledgment of whos on the playing field now: Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back. I push your cap, before ninety-three, I pushed crack. Im hood, black, you know me well, whats good, scrap? Im smoking rappers, you are a Lwhats good, Smack? Pusha T is the well-known rapper who has worked with Kanye West, while Smack White is an underground battle rapper. Crushed Egos begins with a sample of a man saying, You practiced twenty years? You must be extremely good, then. And he is: Raekwon enters with a verse that sticks to his tradition of folding together phonemes and slang that sound better for lining up askew. He raps, Restaurants with skeleton keys is big business. Well groomed and elegant, postures real dapper. Status is gigantic, coats is alpaca. The verse reminds us that the solo albums of many of Wu-Tangs members are stronger than some of the group efforts. Raekwons Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... (1995) is possibly the most complex of all the Wu albums. GZAs Liquid Swords (1995) is the most coherent and fluid. Ghostface Killahs Supreme Clientele (2000) is the most fun and unhinged. And then theres the work of the m.c. whom Raekwon shouts out as Ason Unique, one of the names used by Ol Dirty Bastard, the bands only casualtyhe died in 2004. The rapper struggled with many antagonists, including the police, drugs, and himself. A new book called The Dirty Version, written by his constant companion, Buddha Monk, describes the continual state of tumult the rapper lived in, doling out money to friends and lovers and relatives, going AWOL for recording sessions, and generally not accepting that he was possibly the best-known Wu-Tang member. There have been few unexpected appearances as lovely as Dirtys verse on Mariah Careys Fantasy, which created a bridge between unchecked lunacy and showroom optimism that nobody has been able to cross since. There is none of Dirtys mania or gurgling on A Better Tomorrow, which is a bit defanged. That makes it a perfect primer; there are dozens of albums featuring this producer and these rappers, perhaps the richest catalogue of any single group in rap. The collective is responsible for more than forty albums, probably half of which are worth owning. Thats a pretty good average for a deeply disorganized bunch of people. If A Better Tomorrow does anything for you, go straight to yesterday."
The Washington Post,L,How Washington made itself irrelevant - The Washington Post," By Bruce Katz December 4 at 4:38 PM     Bruce Katz is a vice president at the Brookings Institution and co-author of The Metropolitan Revolution.    Now that the midterms are behind us, lets have an honest assessment of whats really happening in our nations capital: The federal governments power is diminishing. Washington is becoming less effective at addressing many of our nations problems and less consequential in bolstering the cities and regions that drive the economy.  Given the excessive partisanship on display, its tempting to blame Washingtons stumbling solely on ideological polarization. But thats not the case. The source of the federal governments feebleness is structural, and until its run-down foundations are addressed, Washingtons influence around the country will continue to wane.  In the past, Washington has been in the business of investing at scale in the assets that drive the economy, including education, infrastructure and research and development. No longer. Instead, we now have a shrunken pool of resources for investments, a piecemeal approach to delivering funding and few mechanisms that tie the capital to the rest of the country. How has this happened? First, the federal government just doesnt have as much discretionary money to spend as it used to. Demographics and the configuration of social programs have consigned it to spending nearly half its yearly revenue on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, a percentage that will continue to rise as the population continues to age. These programs are absolutely crucial, but their growth puts the squeeze on everything else. Discounting the defense component, discretionary spending represents only 17 percent of the national budget. The fiscal 2015 budget allocation for non-defense discretionary spending is set at an all-time low, as a percentage of gross domestic product, and will continue to decline over time.  The effects of this scaling back are already being felt. Federal research and development spending, for example, has declined from 4.9 percent of the federal budget in 2004 to 3.4 percent in 2014. The Community Development Block Grant, perhaps the federal governments most iconic and flexible urban program, was originally funded at some $2.5billion per year in 1974 ($11 billion in 2014 dollars). Despite urban population gains in the tens of millions over the past 40 years, funding now sits around only $3 billion. Second, the piecemeal way Washington allocates discretionary spending severely limits its ability to stimulate large-scale change. Its a legacy arrangement  money is distributed through a set of outdated agencies, many formed in the 1950s and 1960s, carrying out programs established in the 1970s and 1980s, through means more appropriate for a pre-Internet age. The funds are narrowly targeted at discrete programs run by separate agencies under inflexible rules.  Todays economy demands the opposite. In the metropolitan areas that produce 91percent of GDP, economic and political conditions vary enormously, and integration and collaboration across public agencies is necessary for success. Cities need the flexibility to devise their own approaches to problems  because what works in Phoenix, for example, will not be the same as what works in Pittsburgh. To be a meaningful platform-setter for the nation, the federal government needs to allow cities and metropolitan areas to consolidate funding streams and use them to address problems in ways they see fit.  Third, Washington no longer has the discretion to help metro areas finance important projects and carry out complicated tasks. Congressional earmarks used to serve as the vehicle that tied national representatives to the goings-on back home, but they were done away with in 2011. This has had terrible consequences  it has untethered senators and House members from the places they were elected to represent. The system wasnt perfect, but earmarks did require members of Congress to know about and advocate for projects underway in their home districts and forced them to (occasionally) set aside their ideological convictions for the sake of a deal. Without the ability to procure federal funding for local efforts, representatives have very little discretion over what happens in their districts and are virtually irrelevant in the real decision-making processes that local, metro and state leaders are involved with every day. In the executive branch, likewise, restrictive statutes have left agencies with little flexibility to be a helpful, problem-solving partner to cities and metro areas. Put simply, local leaders who need help no longer have any business traveling to Washington. The nations capital has become the site of photo ops, pep talks, news conferences and little else. As Washington fades into the background, the rest of the nation is engaging in a great experiment  can a country successfully invest in its future without the national government being a relevant player? Americas cities are already finding out.   Read more about this topic:    George F. Will: Congresss bad habits   Charles Krauthammer: Seize the day, control the agenda        "

The Washington Post,L,Police union: We dont believe its an issue of race. We believe its an issue of poverty - The Washington Post," By Lydia DePillis December 4 at 4:36 PM  Follow @lydiadepillis   Protests have broken out across the country afterthe decisions of two grand juries not to indict police officers in separate incidents that resulted in thedeaths of two unarmed black men, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Demonstrators are asking whether police too often escape accountability for the excessive use of force  and whether police unions, in defendingtheir members, are part of the problem. The Atlantics Conor Friedersdorf and economist Adam Ozimekwent so far as to argue that police shouldnt have collective bargaining rights at all, since trust in the police is so damaged when officerswho use excessive force walk free. Being a police officer should be the kind of job where if you mess up a little bit, you get fired, Ozimek writes. For a response, we checked in withFraternal Order of Police National President Chuck Canterbury, who laid out the unions perspective on police prosecutions and whetherthe force has a race problem. Here are some of his responses, lightly edited for clarity and length.    Are the police too well-protected? (Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News)  The national FOP has our own legal defense plan, but thats predominantly used by smaller lodges, because they cant afford a program. But most of our bigger police department unions have either funded through their dues plan, or they have a separate plan, for legal defense. For instancein my state, a member has to elect a legal plan and pay for it himself or herself. Its in excess of their dues, and its a formal insurance policy. It covers administrative issues, disciplinary issues, as well as civil cases  where theyre sued and their employer is not required to represent them, then our plan kicks in. We havent seen a sharp increase in need. Its been pretty steady for years and years and years.Our legal plan is not designed to get people off; its designed to allow them to have due process.A unions job is to provide them an attorney for due process purposes. Every citizen we arrest has the right to have an attorney, so it gives our guys the right to have an attorney in the event that theyre accused of something. I dont think complaints have increased in law enforcement. Ithink over the last 20 years complaints against police officers have gone down substantially [Editor's note: The latest federal data on complaints comes from 2002, and hasn't been updated since]. You have two high-profile cases right now in the media, butpolice in this country make millions of contacts a year in this country. Obviously there are going to be situations that occur where officers are accused of wrongdoing, but I think overall a tremendous professionalism has developed.  The thing about a grand jury process is they hear more evidence that people hear at a trial. So grand jury proceedings, contrary to popular belief, are a stalwart in our judicial system and very successful. There are police officers in jail right now all over the country who have been convicted of excessive force. Each complaint has to be judged on its own merits. The Justice Department alone  theyve prosecuted over 300 police officers nationwide for excessive force complaints,using the civil rights clauses [Editor's note: The Department of Justice confirms that since 2009, 394 police and corrections officers have been charged in ""color of law"" cases]. A lot of police officers are discharged every year, and theres not a national database of information, but sustained complaints result in an officer being terminated.      The president of the union that represents New York City police officers praised Wednesday's grand jury decision in Staten Island not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the choking death of Eric Garner last summer. (AP)   On race and policing: I think weve probably had the conversation long before the countrys had it. TheFOPs been on record over the last 15 years denouncing racial profiling. Its not a legitimate police practice; its not taught in any police academy in the country. That doesnt mean there arent officers who have racial bias. But any cop who demonstrates any form of racial bias should be put off the job, and we support that. The one topic thats not being discussed and is never discussed is [that] we dont believe its an issue of race. We believe its an issue of poverty. Communities that have distrust of law enforcement  its because law enforcement is the only part of government they ever see. Theyre poor; infant mortality rates are higher; single-family homes are higher; unemployment is higher; people dont live as long as the average American. And that is the issue in every community in America that we police. Race is an issue that should have open discussion, but the bottom line is,when you have depressed communities, it leads to higher crime, which leads to more police,which leads to the only part of government they ever see. Law enforcements even used in child cases. In most states, social workers cant take a child away: Police are required to do that. Even when its not a criminal matter,police are usually the people who have to enforce it. The distrust in communities is not nearly seen as much in older Americans, because they want their neighborhoods protected, they want somebody patrolling. But I do think theres a criminal element that distrusts law enforcement, and rightfully so, they should, because its our guys jobs to try to catch them. And in economically depressed areas,theres lot of crime, and theres a lot of call for law enforcement. Andpoliticians and police management, going all the way back to the first broken windows community-oriented policing scenario, police have saturated high crime areas attempting to reduce crime rates. Look at the city of Washington, they reduced their poor communities by displacing them into Prince Georges County, and they reduced their crime rate significantly. Consequently, the Prince Georges murder rate went up. Andthe only thing that moved were poor people. I relate it to: Youve got a young male thats unemployed, cant find a job, has no transportation to a job, sits in his neighborhood, and he watches the kid on the corner making $5,000 a week selling dope, being able to supply his family, and feeling hopeless. And I dont think law enforcements the answer to those situations. Theresthousands and thousands of stories every year of police officers going out on their own and doing things for people in those poor neighborhoods. So I dont agree that theres a systemic racial bias in law enforcement. Theres hardly a police officer on the street now that was alive in the civil rights movement. Its 20-somethings and 30-somethings out there doing police work, andthey werent raised in segregated communities,so I think the racial bias in the 60s that was obviously there in law enforcement is long gone. On the Cleveland shooting of a 12-year-old with an Airsoft gun: Obviously its not a real weapon, but our officers cant tell that. Those Airsoft pistols look just as real as anything else if you take the orange off the tip. And theres no real way to tell until you have a chance to examine it. Obviously officers have a chance to protect themselves if theyre approached by that type of weapon, and its a shame for the officers that have to be involved with that,they live with whatever action they take for the rest of their lives. But when the weapon looks real, theyre trained to react, and rightfully so. Theres nothing in American jurisprudence that says police officers are supposed to get assaulted or killed. On Eric Garner: The lessons from this week should be, even if youre confronted by a law enforcement officer and you believe the officers wrong,resisting arrest is not the right answer. The right answer is to comply and use the system to file a complaint later. But resisting arrest can only lead to the officer using force to subdue you. You dont use equal force  you use more force, because equal force doesnt get you anywhere.If theres an issue,theres a lot of things in place to address that after the fact.But the most important thing is, resisting arrest seems to be the case when people get hurt. I cant speak to [Garners] state of mind, and I dont think anybody else can, either. He had over 30 previous arrests, so I think he knew what he was doing. Even in that case, if hed complied and was put in handcuffs, he wouldve been out of custody in a matter of hours.If hed complied, we wouldnt even be talking about it. Nobody wouldve cared that he was arrested for selling illegally untaxed cigarettes. Which is a huge problem, by the way. Theres a huge criminal element. A few years ago, in Charlotte, North Carolina, they busted a ring that was sending money to al Qaeda, and they were doing it through illegal cigarette sales. Sothere is a nexus. Street-levelselling loosies probably doesnt lead to that, but it still was a crime that he was going to be arrested for. And he knew that. Hed been arrested before. "
The Washington Post,L,French horns? Snowshoes? TVs? Pentagon details what it gives to U.S. police - The Washington Post," By Dan Lamothe and Steven Rich December 4 at 1:40 PM  Follow @danlamothe Follow @dataeditor      A member of the St. Louis County Police Department points his weapon in the direction of a group of protesters in Ferguson, Mo. in August. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)  The Pentagon program that sends excess military equipment to police across the country has been under scrutiny since August, when civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., came to a head and the tactics of police there came under fire by civil rights advocates. But the controversy appears to have prompted change: after years of declining to do so, the Defense Department has released a detailed breakdown of what it has supplied to police departments. The results range from the mundane (battery chargers), to the powerful (armored mine-resistant vehicles), to the surprising (trumpets?). It also includes everything from helicopters to robots designed to help bomb squads. The Pentagons Excess Property Program, sometimes known as the 1033 Program, has supplied police departments across the country with more than $4.3 billion in gear since 1997, including $449 million in 2013, Pentagon officials said. The data was quietly posted on a Freedom of Information Act reading room for the Pentagons Defense Logistics Agency on Nov. 21, as the Marshall Project noted today. Its a significant change in policy: The Defense Department has repeatedly rejected FOIA requests for a full accounting of the 1033 programs recipients. The spreadsheets, captured here for Checkpoint, highlight the sheer volume of equipment the Pentagon is giving away  and that many of the departments receiving it are not big-city departments, but small police forces. There are hundreds of organizations that have received armored mine-resistant vehicles, for example. Designed to protect combat troops from gunfire, rockets and roadside bombs, they have been sent to police departments who are ostensibly concerned about terrorism. Recipients include:  The Val Verde Sheriff Office in Del Rio, Texas, which protects a rural county of about 50,000 people near the Mexico border. The Washington Police Department in Iowa, which has 10 sworn officers in a town of about 7,000. The Rehoboth Police Department in Massachusetts, which serves a town of about 10,000 along the Rhode Island border. The Saddleback College Police in California, which work at a community college.  Perhaps predictably, among the most common items issued were rifles, both in 5.56mm and 7.62mm caliber. They were supplied to departments large and small in a variety of quantities. Police in Long Beach, Calif., for example, have received 200 5.56mm rifles. On the unexpected side: the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department in southern California received 500 pairs of snowshoes, the Clayton Township Police Department in Michigan and the North Kingsville Police Department in Ohio each received a French horn, and more than 372 televisions were supplied to police across the country, designated for personal/home use. In Cherokee County, Ala., the sheriffs department also received 15,000 metal fence posts. Total value: more than $127,000.

If comedy is tragedy plus time, I need more (expletive)time."" That was Jon Stewart's response to a Staten Islandgrand jury decision not to indict the NYPD officer who placed Eric Garner in an apparent chokehold in the summer. The unarmed black man later died. Stewart added at the opening of Wednesday's ""Daily Show"": ""...but I would really settle for less (expletive)tragedy, to be honest with you."" ""The Daily Show"" host played it serious during the opening segment, comparing the Garner case to last week's Ferguson grand jury decision, which also resulted in no indictment for a white cop who killed an unarmed black man. ""None of the ambiguities that existed in the Ferguson case exist in the Staten Island case,"" Stewart said, ""and yet the outcome is exactly the same.""    The Daily Show Get More: Daily Show Full Episodes,Indecision Political Humor,The Daily Show on Facebook   The July confrontation between Garner and Officer Daniel Pantaleo was videotaped; the widely-circulated footage of Pantaleo holding Garner's neck in an apparent chokehold as the man repeatedly says, ""I can't breathe,"" prompted outrage in New York and beyond. Garner died just weeks before officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. The Ferguson case, however, was not filmed. Prosecutors there presented conflicting witness accounts of the confrontation to the grand jury. But Stewart said that in contrast to the Ferguson case, the Staten Island case appeared to be clear. ""Here, there is is none of that [ambiguity]. The coroner called it homicide, the guy's not acting threatening, and we know that because we are (expletive)watching it. Someone taped it."" ""To look at the bright side, we're about to save ourselves a (expletive) of money on cop-camera vests,"" Stewart added of one of the Obama administration's proposed solutions to incidents like those in Ferguson and Staten Island. ""I assume that the solution that they're proposing, if implemented, would look something like the Eric Garner case."" ""We are definitely not living in a post-racial society."" Stewart added, ""and I can imagine there are a lot of people out there wondering how much of a society we're living in at all."" ""So that's our show!"" the host joked, asking for a video segue back to comedy. The segment ends with some kittens being unspeakably adorable."
The Washington Post,L,A safe zone in Syria would be a forward step in the Islamic State fight - The Washington Post,"   Turkish soldiers gather around a bonfire in Mursitpinar in the Sanliurfa province near the border with Syria on December 1, 2014. (Ilyas Akengin/AFP/Getty Images)   By Editorial Board December 4 at 8:56 PM   UNDER PRESSURE from allies, the Obama administration appears to be creeping toward a correction of its strategy in Syria. If so  and officials stress that President Obama has made no decisions and none is imminent  the change would be welcome. The president has been counting on moderate Syrian forces to fight the Islamic State while refusing to address the threat those forces face from the regime of Bashar al-Assad. That policy has prompted Turkey to withhold vital cooperation and, more seriously, has risked the destruction of U.S. allies, who have been losing territory to both the Assad regime and Islamic extremist groups. As reported by The Post and other news organizations, the plan under consideration would be incremental and probably too weak to decisively advance U.S. interests in Syria. But it might at least head off disaster. The Posts Karen DeYoung reported that U.S. officials are discussing the creation of a de facto safe zone along the Turkish border, perhaps 20 miles deep and 100 miles long, that the rebels could hold with the help of U.S. and allied airstrikes and Turkish special forces. The border strip, which extends toward the besieged, Kurdish-held town of Kobane, is currently controlled by forces from the Islamic State. But the strategy would include deterring Syrian government aircraft from entering the area, shielding it from bombing raids. The safe zone could allow the entry into Syria of political exiles attempting to set up a badly needed alternative to the Assad government. It could also give breathing room to the moderate Free Syrian Army. In recent weeks its forces in Aleppo have been hemmed in by the regime, which captured one of the two remaining road routes into rebel-held districts. Meanwhile, the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front has captured parts of Idlib province, south and west of Aleppo, driving out Free Syrian Army forces. Turkey, with whom senior U.S. officials have been negotiating the plan, could substantially step up its contribution to the war. U.S. warplanes would be allowed to operate out of Incirlik Air Base instead of traveling from the Persian Gulf, greatly increasing the time they could linger over battlefields in Syria and northern Iraq. Turkish special forces might play the role of spotters for bombers  filling another gap in the current operation. The government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been pressing for a more ambitious strategy, including a no-fly zone that would extend to Aleppo. That would be a much heavier blow to the Assad regime; it would entrench the moderate opposition in the countrys second-largest city and could force the serious negotiations about a post-Assad government that the Obama administration says it seeks.  White House hesitation is attributed to worries about being slowly sucked into Syrias civil war, the radicalization of forces it supports or the pressure that might mount to deploy U.S. ground troops. While these dangers are real, they are more likely to materialize if Mr.Obama fails to remedy the weakness of his current policy. To eliminate the Islamic State, Syria must be stabilized under a new regime. The sooner the United States accepts that reality and takes steps to bring it about, the lower the risks and the cost.

The Washington Post,L,The big winner of the holiday season so far: mobile shopping - The Washington Post," By Sarah Halzack December 4 at 10:59 AM  Follow @sarahhalzack      There's a mobile app for eBay's smartphone consumers. (Photo by Paul Sakuma Photography/eBay via AP Images)  For years now, we've heard a steady drumbeat of forecasts suggesting that mobile devices are going to play an increasingly crucial role in every step of a shopping expedition, from browsing and couponing to purchasing. And in the five-day shopping bonanza that stretched from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, there was ample evidence that this long-anticipated tipping point has arrived. For the first time ever, smartphones and tablets accounted for the majority of all online traffic on Thanksgiving Day, according to data analysis by IBM. On Black Friday, one in four online purchases were made on a mobile device. ""This year was probably the first holiday season thatwe really saw mobile really take off, said Brian Yarbrough, senior retail analyst at financial services firm Edward Jones. Wal-Mart saysthat about 70 percent of its Web traffic between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday came from mobile devices, while JCPenney said more thanhalf of its traffic came from smartphones and tablets. Best Buy's Web site was briefly taken down Friday morning whilethe company struggled to deal with an unexpected surge in mobile Web traffic. As users take to mobileplatforms in greater numbers, retailers are learning that small-screen shoppers are different: They buy fewer things andhave less patience for a checkout process that is anything less than incredibly efficient. Also, while shoppers did plenty of browsing this holiday season on their cellphones, tablets and PCs still reigned for actually making purchases. Smartphones accounted for 34.7 percent of traffic on Black Friday, but just 11.8 percent of sales. Tablets accounted for 14.6 percent of traffic and 16 percent of sales. ""There's some kind of a disparity between traffic and conversion on smartphones,"" said Calvin Silva, senior retail industry analyst for Nasdaq Advisory Services. BaubleBardiscovered that how mobile customers reach the e-commerce jewelry company's sitecan make a difference. Tablet shoppers were more likely to reach the company's sitethrough a search engine this holiday season, while smartphone users were more likely to come from Facebook or other social media. The company had to adjust, saidDaniella Yacobovsky, a BaubleBar co-founder. For tablets and laptops, which have larger screens, Yacobovsky said, ""we feel comfortable sending them to pages that have a little bit more of a design element to them."" Elissa Margolis, senior vice president of Disney Store North America, said that a large share of Disney Store's mobile shoppers were simply browsing. ""Our merchandiseis exclusive, so theyre not using it [for] comparisons across other retailers,"" Margolis said. ""But they may be using it to see if an item is available, read reviews."" Margolis said that about 90 percent of Disney Store's mobile traffic has typically come from Web browsers, not the store's app. But Margolis said the company is now doubling down on trying to draw more users to its app, which she acknowledges will be challenging. ""There needs to be a reason why you would put an app on your phone versus just using your browser,"" Margolis said. JCPenney revamped its iPhone app and mobile Web site in time for the holidays. The company said it believes the more seamless experience helped it turn more mobile browsers into buyers, reaching aconversion rate ""in the 30 percent range"" during parts of the holiday weekend. Retailers and analysts say they expect that the growth of mobile sales and traffic to be a bright spot throughout the holiday season. In particular, they predict these gadgets will be crucial weapons for the omnichannel shopper -- that is, the one who bounces around between in-store, desktop and mobile shopping. ""The consumer expects to be able to go in and out of a physical and digital world in a completely seamless way,"" said Doug Hope, a retail marketing expert with GlobalShop. ""This is the very beginning of a very significant shift in focus."" "
The Washington Post,L,Developer wants portion of I-395 in D.C. shut down to expedite construction project - The Washington Post,"   Traffic is seen at a standstill in the southbound lanes of the Third Street tunnel of Interstate 395 after protesters blocked traffic on Nov. 30 in Washington. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)   By Luz Lazo and Jonathan O'Connell December 4 at 8:33 PM  Follow @luzcita Follow @OConnellPostBiz    Federal authorities are considering a request to shut down two-thirds of a mile of Interstate 395 in the District  one of the busiest stretches of highway in the city  for more than a year so that a mammoth development project can be completed more quickly. New York-based Property Group Partners says that if the highway is closed between New York Avenue and D Street NW for 15 to 18 months, it could cut in half the construction time of a $200million deck over the freeways entrance that will support its 2.2million-square-foot development there, Capitol Crossing.  Without full access to that portion of the freeway, the platform project could take at least three years to complete, require loud work at night and potentially endanger workers, the developer says. But the proposal has raised concerns that it would cripple one of the Washington areas busiest commuter thoroughfares  which carries as many as 90,000 vehicles a day  and worsen the regions gridlock. This would be impacting tens of thousands of people ... and it will have a cascading effect. All the vehicles that cant be there are going to be forced onto other very crowded major routes in the city, AAA Mid-Atlantic spokesman Lon Anderson said.   Proposed closings for Capitol Crossing construction. (Source:)  City officials and business leaders acknowledge that it would be painful but say the proposal is worth considering, based on the value Capitol Crossing will bring to the city. Building the deck requires installing about 150 caissons along the median to support a network of steel girders. Jeffrey I. Sussman, president and founder of Property Group Partners, has told the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the D.C. Department of Transportation that installing the caissons while the highway is in use would be hazardous and disturb nearby residents. Under the proposal, exits to New York and Massachusetts avenues would be closed, leaving access to and from the highway through C and D streets. That would involve setting up detours, but Sussman said he figures that drivers would navigate around the closures until the highway can be reopened. People find their way who drive because they like to drive. They like to figure out how to do it, he said. FHWA officials have been quietly reviewing the developers request and declined to say whether it is likely to be approved. But closing portions of a major highway for such an extended period would be unprecedented in the region. For example, when major work has been done on the Capital Beltway, parts of the road have been shut for brief periods in the overnight hours, but most times, a lane has remained open during the project. The only time the city shut a major commuter route in recent memory was the summer of 2007, when the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge across the Anacostia River was closed for eight weeks for an overhaul, creating headaches for motorists who use South Capitol Street.   Traffic gridlock is seen on Interstate 395 in the District in this file photo. A developer is asking that a portion of the highway be closed for more than a year. (Jason Reed/Reuters)  Capitol Crossing represents the realization of a longtime dream for the city. Since the 1980s, the District has envisioned filling the 6.8acres of mostly air space over the sunken I-395 corridor, hoping to reconnect F and G streets between Second and Third streets. The project will comprise three new city blocks bounded by Massachusetts Avenue to the north, EStreet to the south, Third Street to the west and Second Street to the east. In all, it would deliver five buildings for office, retail and residential uses, with the first building completed in 2017 and the rest within nine years. The bridging over the highway overpass would reconnect neighborhoods split by the freeway and create a more vibrant community in the downtowns eastern flank, supporters say. It is currently, and has been since the highway was introduced in the middle of the city, a visible and physical scar upon our fair city. It is also a pedestrian nightmare and an unproductive piece of real estate, said Matthew Troy, the citys director of real estate. There is going to be an impact, obviously. But if the impact can be shortened, it is something that we want to explore, Troy said. Rich Bradley, executive director of the Downtown D.C. Business Improvement District, an association of property owners, including Sussmans company, said the project would help connect the Union Station area with downtown. It has always been understood that development was going to be built over those air rights, he said. But the project, in order to be built, has to at some point interrupt the traffic so crews can build the support columns for the development that will take place above it. Still, news of the proposal to shut down part of I-395 came as a surprise to some city officials. D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), head of the panels transportation committee, said she wasnt aware of the request until a reporter asked her about it. My jaw dropped at the idea of closing 395  with the disruption that that would cause, Cheh said. I just dont see how that could work in any way that wouldnt be a nightmare. Traffic disruptions related to the project started in the area in April, when crews began to move and upgrade underground utilities. There were more disruptions in September, when crews began to close some lanes on H Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW between Second and Fourth streets from 7a.m. to 10p.m. weekdays and from 8a.m. to 8p.m. Saturdays. Besides lane closures, the project has forced bus stops to be moved. Officials at the FHWA are studying the potential impact to determine whether granting the request is appropriate, the agency said. In November, the agency received two letters from DDOT inquiring about the request to close the highway and the southbound I-395 Third Street ramp to expedite the project. DDOT spokesman Reggie Sanders declined to discuss what effect the closure might have or what the agency might do to mitigate the disruption. Part of this process involves determining the impact on traffic as a result of the requested closure, Sanders said. To that end, we await the findings of FHWA. DDOT and FHWA declined to provide copies of the letters that detail the developers request, saying that a reporter would need to file a Freedom of Information Act request. Chehs office was told by DDOT that if the federal highway agencys response is that the closure is feasible, there would be at least a six-month study of the likely impact and possible alternatives. At that point, the federal agency could decline or approve the request, and DDOT would then get involved in the decision. They better think this through very carefully, Cheh said. Hermela Bealfan, a Lorton, Va., resident who regularly uses the Third Street tunnel to get downtown, said that traffic on I-395 is already a daily ordeal and that she cant imagine what it would be like if the small portion leading to New York Avenue is closed. Even if it is just one day, it will be a mess, she said. It is already a very, very hectic area. I was born and raised here, and I have never driven down there and not experienced traffic, except at two in the morning sometimes, if I am lucky. A closure, and even just lane closures, would frustrate drivers who have been dealing with other construction-related traffic problems on I-395. Bealfan, who travels to the District at least three times a week, says shes had enough of the work at the Springfield Mixing Bowl and, more recently, the construction of the express lanes. Now they want to close the Third Street tunnel? No! Thats absurd, she said. They should just do the construction at nighttime like everyone else does in this area. And they should leave a lane open  at least one lane. But in some respects, Washington has been anticipating this work for two decades, said Bradley, of the Business Improvement District. Although road authorities have a difficult task, there would be gains from the project: a close to $1.5billion investment that once completed could generate at least $30million in property taxes while jump-starting development in the area. The trade-off of closing two highway entrances for 15 to 18 months, instead of three years with intermittent changes and lane closures, is that the project can move forward faster, the impact on traffic end sooner and the scar of the decades of split communities can be healed, he said. We are sorry there will be inconveniences, but there is no way around it, unfortunately. "
The Washington Post,L,Does this postal chairmans lobbying history pose a conflict of interest? - The Washington Post," By Josh Hicks December 4 at 6:00 AM  Follow @reporter_hicks      The Postal Service could potentially make billions of dollars annually by offeringsmall loans, but private lenders arent fond of the idea. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  The U.S. Postal Service is in a positiontoearn billions of dollars a year by enteringthe payday-loan business, but former banking lobbyist Mickey Barnett couldblock its path. Barnett now chairs the USPS Board of Governors. He previouslyrepresentedtheinterests of payday lenders, the very folks whostand to lose out if the Postal Service grabs a share of the small-loan market. By venturing intothe loan business, thePostal Service could experiencean influx of new revenue after eight straight years of multibillion-dollar losses. Would Barnettsupport such a move, or would he oppose itbecause of his old ties to the banking industry? Either way, the Leadership Conference on Human and Civil Rightsseesa potential conflict of interest.The group issued a letter to all members of the Senate this week urging the lawmakers not to confirm Barnett for another term until he thoroughly explains his positions on payday lending. As a past lobbyist for the payday-lending industry, Mr. Barnett has demonstrated a willingness to ignore the public interest in favor of the pecuniary interests of his clients, the letter said. He must give assurances that he would not use his position to promote the practices of the industry he previously represented. The Leadership Conference also suggested that the Postal Service would be a more trustworthy source ofpayday loans, which arecash advances that have to berepaid by the next payday. The loans arecontroversial because of their high interest rates and the fact that they often trap low-income individuals in a cycle of debt. A report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this years said more than 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within two weeks. Areport this year from the USPSinspector general said the Postal Service could offer interest rates of 28 percent on payday loans, which would be far lower thanthe triple-digit rates that traditional lenders charge. Payday lenderstend to set up shopin African-American and Hispanic communities, which is another reason the Leadership Conference has taken such an interest in Barnetts stance toward the practice. The group sees an opportunity forthe Postal Service, whichAmericans largely trust, to provide cash advances in those communities at lowerrates. Barnett joined the postal board in 2006. The previous year, he opposed efforts by the New Mexico legislature to impose stricter regulations on payday lenders, such aslimiting delinquency fees and requiring lenders to forgive loans once a customer has paid twice the amount that was borrowed. Working as an attorney, Barnett argued in one case that borrowers must settle disputes with lenders through arbitration rather than through the courts, and that no such restrictions should apply to lenders. The New Mexico Supreme Court unanimously rejected that positionas substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. The Postal Service has long provided financial services, including money orders and international money transfers. It also offered savings accounts until 1967. Researchers have estimated that the agencycould bring in nearly $9 billion annually by capturing 10 percent of the market from Americans on the fringes of the banking system, according to the inspector generals report. But industry groups such as the American Bankers Association have pushed back against further USPS foraysinto the financial-services, arguing that the agency could have unfair advantages  theoreticallythrough fewer regulations and the perception of being government-endorsed. Any major policy changes for the Postal Servicerequire congressional approval, so the agencys board of governors could not act alone on the payday-loan matter. But Barnett would still play a deciding role if the Senate confirms him for another term. TheUSPS has not provided a statement from Barnett or a reaction to the Leadership Conferences concerns, despiteseveral requests from the Federal Eye on Wednesday."
The Washington Post,L,Even climate change experts and activists are in denial about climate change - The Washington Post,"  By Aanka Batta and Steffen Bhm December 4 at 11:55 AM Follow SteffenBoehm   About the authors  Aanka Batta is a lecturer in marketing at University of Essex.Steffen Bhm is a professor in management and sustainability and the director of the Essex Sustainability Institute at University of Essex.       Fires burn in the Amazon basin in Brazil. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)  Another month, another important U.N. climate change conference. The latest is in Lima, the capital of Peru. Thousands of experts from the world of politics, business, academia and civil society  and Leonardo DiCaprio  have flown around the world to urge us all to curb our carbon emissions. Recent meetings have failed to make significant progress. Yet, this year there are high hopes that the U.S.-China climate deal and the New York U.N. Climate Summit will allow Lima to provide a stepping stone for a binding emissions agreement at next years meeting in Paris. However, even if a deal can be reached  despite the urgent need for it  there is no guarantee that global greenhouse gas emissions will actually be reduced significantly and that dangerous climate change can be averted. Psychoanalytic theory provides disturbing insight into why this may be so  and it is all to do with the split psychological makeup of those who work at the forefront of climate science, policy and activism. Climate denial can be unconscious For at least a century, psychoanalysis has taught us that we might be consciously thinking and saying one thing, but unconsciously doing another. In this context, that means people are very aware of the threats posed by climate change, even if they arent doing too much about it. Not a week goes by without the media showing catastrophic images of environmental damage and social suffering seemingly caused by a changing climate. Research suggests that such threats lead us to adopt various unconscious coping and defense mechanisms. Many people try to keep the catastrophe at bay or deny it is happening. Vested interests such as the Koch brothers in the United States and other conservative forces have cleverly exploited this unconscious response by supporting a small group of scientists, politicians and think tanks to spread the message of climate skepticism and denial.  This stuff works. Climate denial is undoubtedly on the rise, particularly in those media-saturated markets of North America, Europe and Australia. The Kochs and others are clearly filling a psychological void. Research also has shown that people want to protect themselves a little bit, particularly in times of crisis and uncertainty. If climate change simply isnt happening, theres nothing to worry about. Another popular coping and defense mechanism is to pretend that we can address this global and urgent problem by tinkering at the edges of business as usual. For example, politicians and business leaders widely believe that we can achieve a decarbonization of the global economy while maintaining high economic growth. Social psychologist Matthew Adams says such a response is part of an unconscious coping mechanism that simply implies that we have pushed the problem onto a distant future. As the geographer Erik Swyngedouw shows, climate change politics could in fact be seen as a post-political phenomenon where apocalyptic images of environmental destruction and human suffering are used to justify swift action without allowing any real political and economic choices. For example, while on one day the U.K. government is acknowledging that climate change is having stark impacts on developing countries by pledging 720 million pounds (about $1.1 billion) to poor countries, another day of the political calendar is dominated by rhetoric that emphasizes economic growth and even the expansion of the oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom. Urgent action on climate change is thus to be implemented within a business-as-usual framework of high growth and high consumption, despite growing evidence that such growth doesnt make us happier and that it is very likely to deliver increasing carbon emissions for years and decades to come. In psychosocial theory, these defense mechanisms also are referred to as splitting. Consciously we might be talking about the impending sustainability crisis, but unconsciously we find ways to maintain the status quo. This is also true for those climate experts who fly around the world, going from one global climate change summit to the next. The very carbon emissions associated with their work can be seen as part of a denial strategy. In fact, one could argue that those who are very close to the reality of climate change are particularly prone to a need to split their identity. The knowledge they have, and the images they have seen, might unconsciously lead them to the above-mentioned counter-balancing and coping behaviors. Not a good omen for the latest round of climate talks in Peru.     This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article. "
The Washington Post,L,Arab autocrats are not going back to the future - The Washington Post," By Steven Heydemann December 4 at 2:59 PM     Protesters display a large Jordanian flag as they demonstrate to demand political reforms, in Amman, Oct. 5, 2012. (Muhammad Hamed/Reuters)  During the Arab uprisings of late 2010 and 2011, it seemed that the strategies Arab leaders had adopted to keep themselves in power had left them vulnerable to an uncontrollable surge of mass mobilization. Yet by late 2014, even as Arab regimes struggled to manage the aftershocks of mass protests and, in some cases, respond to sustained popular mobilization that has continued, it is clear that authoritarian regimes in the Arab world not only survived the uprisings but adapted their tactics and practices to address the specific challenges associated with the resurgence of mass politics and sustain their hold on power. The events of the past four years are not merely a back to the future moment in authoritarian governance in the Arab world. This reassertion of authoritarianism since 2012 did not come about simply because authoritarian elites in the Middle East held fast to established political routines. In responding to the resurgence of mass politics  processes of mobilization that were in large part caused by popular discontent with failures of authoritarian governance  authoritarian elites have been compelled to adapt. In some cases, regime adaptations drew on but modified established practices. In others, adaptations seem to signal more fundamental changes in elite perceptions about the nature of the threats they face and the changes that would be required to ensure regime survival. In these cases, regime elites seem to have made important, and in some cases potentially transformative, changes in their policies and tactics to control and contain newly mobilized societies. Regime survival should not be taken to minimize the magnitude of the threat that the Arab uprisings posed. Those mass protests confronted regimes with the most significant challenge they had ever faced. The threat of politics from below was all the more potent because it emerged in systems of rule that were explicitly designed to prevent oppositional forms of collective action and spontaneous political mobilization. That the regimes did nonetheless almost universally survive should underscore two important features of arguments about resilient authoritarianism that are often overlooked. First, theories about resilient authoritarianism, and the adaptive capacity of authoritarian regimes in the Arab world, have never taken the position that current systems of rule are permanent or invulnerable. The appropriate metaphor is of earthquake resistant, not earthquake proof, regimes. Second, these theories do not assume that adaptive processes are always limited and constrained by past practices: Path dependence matters, but at moments of crisis in particular, regime adaptations can and do move governance beyond the boundaries of current practices. I view the post-uprising period of the Arab Thermidor as representing one such period. What seem to be emerging as these adaptations take hold are two distinctive modes of authoritarian governance, both of which have troubling implications for the political future of the Middle East. In one set of cases, including Jordan and Morocco, Algeria, and much of the Arab Gulf, shifts in governance are best defined as the extension and deepening of strategies of authoritarian upgrading, reframed in response to the specific challenges posed by the resurgence of mass politics. In a second set of cases, however, including Syria and Egypt, changes in authoritarian governance appear to be more profound. The regimes that are emerging from the most threatening encounters with mass politics are making a sharp, perhaps decisive break with the populist, inclusionary strategies of contained mobilization through which they governed for many decades. What is emerging instead are narrowly-nationalist and exclusionary-repressive modes of authoritarian governance. In both modes, reconfigured authoritarian practices are consistent with the inability of Arab regimes either to sustain redistribution and guarantees of economic security as the basis of state-society relations and conceptions of citizenship, or to establish viable, market-oriented political economies capable of addressing massive, systemic employment crises and ameliorating chronic conditions of economic insecurity that are especially acute among youth. To understand why this most recent cycle of adaptations by authoritarian incumbents marks a decisive shift in governance, and to appreciate its potentially transformative effects, it is useful to assess the broader context in which regime elites are acting today and how it compares to the environment that shaped the systems of rule over which they presided until 2011. In the era in which most post-colonial Arab states were established, newly empowered elites who inherited weak and sharply contested political and economic institutions drew heavily on contemporary understandings about how best to organize a state, manage a national economy, and structure relations between states and societies. At the time, Arab leaders were encouraged by then nascent international financial institutions, such as the newly-established International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to build large, powerful public sectors as a way to compensate for the weakness of private sectors. They embraced import substitution industrialization, the dominant development strategy for developing economies in the post-WWII era, to promote industrialization and the commercialization of agriculture. To exploit but simultaneously manage and channel the high levels of mass mobilization that had emerged in the course of anti-colonial struggles, the first generation of populist-authoritarian leaders  Gamal Abdel Nasser, Adib Shishakli, Habib Bourguiba, Ahmed Ben Bella, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr  embraced pan-Arabism, formed mass-based ruling parties, and promoted state-corporatist frameworks of interest representation. They adopted redistributive social policies, consolidating patterns of state-society relations anchored in authoritarian bargains that guaranteed economic security in exchange for political quiescence. For almost 30 years, this formula produced extraordinary improvements in social conditions across the Arab world. By the mid-1980s, these populist-redistributive systems of rule had become increasingly difficult for regime elites to sustain. Economic crises and the fiscal burden of welfare, subsidy programs, and service provision forced authoritarian incumbents to adapt. Beginning in the 1980s, but with growing momentum in the 1990s, incumbents responded  as they had in the 1950s and 1960s  by appropriating, adapting and applying elements drawn from a global repertoire of models of governance and social policy. Mimicking versions of 1980s-era neo-liberal developmental strategies, in form if rarely in content, they introduced selective strategies of economic and political liberalization that gradually moved Middle East and North Africa political economies toward what the Syrian regime later labeled social market development frameworks. Precursors of the upgrading strategies of the late-1990s and 2000s, these frameworks combined liberalization of select economic sectors, typically determined on the basis of political, regime maintenance criteria, with weakened systems of redistribution. They were designed to generate the resources required to maintain patronage networks, provide opportunities for predatory rent seeking by increasingly narrow circles of regime insiders, and mitigate the broad social effects of reductions in public expenditure. During these years, the organizational containers that had earlier served to manage and channel mass politics decayed. Ruling parties and corporatized associational sectors retained some importance as pathways for patronage, positions and a declining share of economic privilege, but could no longer provide any meaningful sense of political or economic inclusion. In their place, regimes relied more heavily on the institutions of the mukhabarat, intelligence or secret police, to maintain internal security and repress autonomous forms of political mobilization and oppositional collective action. In effect, the authoritarian bargain of the post-independence era had become an authoritarian compromise, the costs of which were borne by the urban middle class, rural clientalist networks, public sector workers and residents of peripheral cities, the social groups that provided the backbone of the Arab uprisings. This potted macro-sociological history of Arab regime formation and reform underscores the importance of the contemporary regional and global context, and its effects on the strategic choices of incumbents, in assessing the dynamics of authoritarian reassertion during the so-called Arab Thermidor. Upgrading strategies that served as an effective response to the challenges regimes confronted in the 1990s and 2000s carried social costs that they could not contain indefinitely. Having confronted these costs during the peak of the Arab uprisings, the principal challenge faced by authoritarian incumbents today is how to manage the enduring, systemic threat of mass politics under conditions of poor capitalism. With ineffectual economic institutions and deep, systemic employment gaps that regimes are unable to close, how can they prevent persistent high levels of anti-regime mass political mobilization? To contend with mobilized publics and to preserve the selective benefits associated with social market strategies of economic governance, regime elites today have a very different set of models on which to draw. The statist, inclusionary and redistributive models of controlled mass mobilization that prevailed in the post-independence era  with all they implied about republicanism, egalitarian conceptions of citizenship, and a moral economy relationship between states and citizens  are simply no longer available as viable options for regime elites. Similarly, with implications that have yet to be fully explored for MENA political economies, the condition that economist Dani Rodrik has recently characterized as premature deindustrialization further constrains the developmental options available to authoritarian incumbents in the Arab world, and further reduces the strategies they can use to close the massive employment gaps they confront, generate highly-skilled industrial employment, and enjoy the large spill-over benefits for other sectors that accompany industrialization. To the extent that MENA political economies are defined by premature deindustrialization, the pathways out of poor capitalism will be very hard to find. The likely outcome is a massive semi-permanent class of underemployed and unemployed whom the state will view as a persistent threat to stability, necessitating repressive-exclusionary modes of governance. Even if MENA countries can escape the trap of premature deindustrialization the alternatives to authoritarianism face strong headwinds. Democratization has been discredited by its association with the presidency of Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, as well as the Libyan and Yemeni experiences. It has been further undermined by public disillusionment with Western liberalism, and by the declining leverage of Western democracies over regional actors who no longer depend on the West for foreign investment and foreign assistance. Nor can the transnational ideologies that legitimated (and tested) Arab regimes, including various versions of politicized Islam, serve that purpose any longer. In contrast, market-oriented models of authoritarian governance are seen as viable alternatives. Reflecting regional trends toward sectarian polarization, regime elites in Syria, Egypt, Bahrain and Libya have sought to reframe mechanisms for containing and channeling mass politics  much of which continues to revolve around demands for economic inclusion, voice, and distributive justice  around combinations of exclusionary, xenophobic, ethno-sectarian, and tribal conceptions of state-society relations and citizenship, policed by newly reinvigorated post-uprising internal security agencies. Thus, even while emergent models of authoritarian governance in the Arab world exhibit a wide range of continuities, they are moving beyond the authoritarian bargains and the authoritarian compromises of earlier eras, toward repressive-exclusionary systems of rule organized in response to the threat of mass politics under conditions of poor capitalism. These emergent models will generate stresses that will test their capacity and their resilience. In their current incarnation, however, the trajectories of authoritarian governance in the Arab world seem to offer little basis for optimism among those who have long hoped that prosperity and democracy would find a firm foothold in the Middle East.

The Washington Post,L,Ben Carson to Wolf Blitzer: I stand by my Nazi Germany-U.S. comments - The Washington Post," By Erik Wemple December 3  Follow @ErikWemple    Ben Carson, the famed neurosurgeon and conservative commentator, has enjoyed a welcoming platform at Fox News, where he formerly served as a contributor. In early November, for instance, Carson outlined a program for ending the cycle of dependency among the poor on an edition of Hannity. Host Sean Hannity responded, A bold vision. On Nov. 21, Fox News host Bill OReilly, in discussing Carsons presidential prospects, told Carson, I will assure you that if [leftists] come after you in an unfair way, we will step up and help you out with that. Possible-presidential-candidate Carson now needs to show off his bona fides toother cable-news audiences, which perhaps explains why he surfaced this afternoon on CNN with anchor Wolf Blitzer. A significant chunk of the discussion focused on comments wherein Carson has compared the contemporary United States to Nazi Germany. To make the comparison of the United States and Nazi Germany  that just struck an awful tone, said Blitzer in a non-question question. Carson responded: Well, Nazi Germany experienced something horrible. The people inNazi Germany largely did not believe in what Hitler was doing, but did they say anything? Of course not  they kept their mouths shut. And theres some very important lessons to be learned there. The fact that our government is using instruments of government like the IRS to punish its opponents  this is not the kind of thing something that, as far as Im concerned, is a Democrat or Republican issue. This is an American issue. This is something that threatens all of our liberty, all of our freedom. Carson said a bit more about how Americans are afraid to express themselves, not that Blitzer was impressed with the logic: But to make the comparison, Dr. Carson, to Nazi Germany, the slaughter of six million Jews by the Nazis, the devastation that erupted in Europe and around the world, to the United States of America, said Blitzer. I want you to reflect on what that potentially means. Complying with Blitzers polite request, Carson explained: Again, you are just focusing on the words Nazi Germany and completely missing the point  and thats the problem right now. Thats what PCism is all about. You may not say this word, regardless of what your point is. Because if you say that word, I go into a tizzy. We can do better than that. When I was a child, and when you were a child, they used to say, Sticks and stones break my bones, words will never hurt me. What ever happened to that? We need to get to the point where we can look beyond the word and look for the meaning. Please excuse Blitzer for thinking that the words Nazi Germany have patent meaning without looking beyond the word. The host asked Carson if he wished to amend his stance on the parallels between Nazi Germany and the United States. Carson declined the invitation. Thats hardly surprising, given that Carson has been terribly consistent on this point."
The Washington Post,L,"The problem with the U.S. policy of no ransoms? Hostage rescues are very, very difficult. - The Washington Post"," By Adam Taylor December 4 at 4:44 PM  Follow @mradamtaylor      A Black Hawk helicopter prepares to land in the Pachir Wa Agam district of Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, in April 2013. (Noorullah Shirzada/AFP/Getty Images)  Last week, U.S. Special Operation forces headed to acave in Hagr al-Saiaar, a remote areaof Yemen for a rare on-the-ground intervention in the Middle Eastern nation. They were taking part in arescue mission and hoped to free a number of hostages chained up in the cage and kept prisoner by alQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a particularly feared al Qaeda offshoot. The rescue mission was not a success. While eight hostages were freed after a firefight that left all the kidnappers dead, five hostages who were expected to be in the cave were not there. According to a a member of Yemen's anti-terrorism force quoted on a Web site connected to Yemen's defense ministry, these five hostagesincluded an American and a Briton. Less than a week later,AQAP released a video that appeared to show the American hostage, a 33-year-old freelance photographer named Luke Sommers. Sommers was filmedpleading for his life,while anal-Qaeda official said that Somers will meet hisinevitable fate unless demands are met by the U.S. government.      The White House admitted on Thursday that a hostage rescue mission last month in Yemen failed to liberate American Luke Somers because he was not present at the targeted location. (AP)   While its unclear what the demands are, it's unlikely they will be met. TheUnited States has a policy of refusing to pay ransoms to terrorists and rarely negotiates with them. Rescue missions like last week's are one of the few options left for the U.S. government when dealing with Americans being held hostage abroad. The big problem is that these rescues can bevery difficult to pull off. Another recent failed rescuesounds remarkably similar to the case in Yemen. AsAdam Goldman and Karen DeYoung reported for The Washington Post back in August, several dozen U.S. commandos were sent to Syria last summer to try to rescue American hostages being held by the Islamic State. It was the first knownU.S. ground operation in Syria since the countryscivil war started. An official told The Post thatthe effort was not ultimately successful because the hostages were not present...at the site of the operation. The operation was only revealed after video was released of the killing of James Foley, one of the Americans who was being held. Both the rescue operation in Yemen and the one in Syria apparently failed due to problems with the intelligence used to plan the raids, a recurring issue for rescue teams in hostile foreign environments. Another big problemis that it can be hard to protect the hostages while fighting their captors:Linda Norgrove, a Scottish aid worker kidnapped by the Taliban in 2010, was killed during theU.S. operation to rescue her. A joint investigation between the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that a grenade thrown by amember of the rescue team had killed Norgrove. Even in successful raids, the rescuers may well end up dead themselves. These rescue missions may well cost more than many ransom demands. ""In terms of cost, this is almost going to be an impossible figure,""Brian Michael Jenkins, aSenior Adviser to the Rand CorporationPresident and terrorism expert told The Post.""It will depend on exactly how you want to do the accounting."" Jenkins said that estimates could range between hundreds of thousands in the minimum to tens of millions of dollars, though he cautioned that cost wasn't the issue. ""It is not a matter of cost effectiveness,"" Jenkins says. The United States is far from alone in finding hostage rescue attempts extremely difficult. In 2013, French commandos failed to rescueintelligence agentDenis Allex from his Somalian captors, and Allex was executed in response. A 2012attempt to rescuea Briton and his Italian colleaguefrom Nigeria's Boko Haram failedwhen their captors killed the hostages. Ultimately, hostage rescues are always going to be difficult.""There's a lot of luck involved in this,"" Peter Ahearn, a formerFBI agent, said of the failed attempt to rescue Foley last summer. ""But you'd rather be lucky than good in some of these things."" In popular culture, however, the successful hostage rescues are the ones that are well-known. Israelis are proud of the daring 1976 Operation Entebbe, which saw 102 hostages rescuedin a Ugandan air field. The British love to talk about 1980s Iranian Embassy Siege in London, which saw all but one of the hostages being held rescued in front of live television cameras. Two of the biggest American films of the past few years, ""Captain Philips"" and ""Argo,"" dealt with successful U.S. hostage rescues. History is filled with failed attempts, too, however. The events depicted in ""Argo"" were preceded by one of the most notorious hostage rescue attempts ever: 1981's Operation Eagle Claw, a failed attempt to rescue diplomats being held in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran that ended in a helicopter crash in the desert that left eight troops dead. That was the first mission by theU.S. militarys Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, which often deals with hostages held by terror groups. Tactics have surely improved since then. Jenkins ofRand Corporation says that in 1980, almost 80 percent of U.S. hostage rescues resulted in at least one hostage dying. In the past few years,a little more than half of U.S. attempts were successful. That's still a high number, but given that the United States refuses to negotiate with terrorists, and that most Americans support that policy, there may be no betteroption. ""If a country is going to adopt a no ransom policy,"" Jenkins says, it must be willing to ""take every reasonable effort to bring about their release without making concessions, and that includes, when feasible, a rescue attempt."""
The Washington Post,L,"For Jay Gruden, the best place for Robert Griffin III is elsewhere - The Washington Post","     Despite a decent performance, Colt McCoy could not pull out a victory for the Redskins, as they lost, 49-27, against the Indianapolis Colts. The Washington Post's Gene Wang and Dan Steinberg discuss how the lackluster defense was mostly to blame. (Kyle Barss/The Washington Post)      By Jason Reid Columnist December 4 at 10:41 AM  Follow @JReidPost     Jay Gruden wanted Robert Griffin III to succeed, but he felt he had no choice last week other than to bench the Washington Redskins once-apparent franchise savior despite the wide-ranging consequences. And while its unclear whether owner Dan Snyder and President and General Manager Bruce Allen are in lock step with their coach, its helpful to examine what convinced Gruden that the franchise must part ways with the 2012 offensive rookie of the year. By making the bold move, Gruden has set the tone for Griffins future as the offseason draws near, and the power of Grudens assessment will be crucial as he tries to persuade Snyder and Allen to follow him. Although Gruden had doubts about Griffin before coming to Washington in January, Griffin was his unquestioned starter from the offseason workouts through training camp to Week 1 of this season. After working with Griffin for more than 10 months, however, Gruden is now done with him, according to people within the organization.  Jason Reid is a sports columnist with the Washington Post. He joined the Posts Redskins team in 2007 after 15 years covering many beats at the Los Angeles Times. View Archive   Google+ RSS   Through three preseason games and five starts in the regular season, Gruden has seen enough to realize Griffin at best is a long-term project as a pocket passer. Griffin was too deliberate reading defenses and displayed poor footwork and an alarming lack of pocket presence for a signal-caller in his third NFL season. Also, Grudens assessment goes deeper than Griffins play. He has major concerns about Griffins decision making off the field, which has come to light through conversations with team officials at Redskins Park. To Gruden, Griffin seemed more concerned about enhancing his brand than about honing his pocket skills. Often, Gruden rolled his eyes after being informed about the life lessons the 24-year-old offered on social media. Gruden became frustrated that Griffin, even after Gruden benched him, failed to acknowledge his role in his failure.         1 of 37       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                       Skip Ad              NFL Week 13: Washington loses to Indianapolis, 49-27    View Photos   Redskins drop to 3-9.

Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.       If it were up to Gruden, the Redskins would make a clean break in the offseason, taking whatever they could get for Griffin in a trade. But despite Griffins awful performance  he hasnt won a game in more than a year while being benched in successive seasons  the situation may not be so clear-cut for Snyder and Allen, who had key roles in the decision to trade four high-round draft picks for the opportunity to select Griffin. It wouldnt be surprising if Snyder and Allen were tempted to give Griffin another shot at reclaiming the starting job. Or they could take a hard-line approach in trade talks, hoping to recoup a portion of the kings ransom it took to get Griffin. In either scenario, the Redskins would wind up as losers. In the NFL, the head coach-quarterback relationship is the most important on the team. A productive one can help provide the foundation of a championship organization. Conversely, its a bad idea to force a coach to work with a quarterback in whom he has no confidence. If Gruden were merely aggravated about Griffins miscues, Gruden could work through that. Early in Brett Favres career with the Green Bay Packers, Mike Holmgren often wanted to strangle Favre for his blockheaded play. During their days with the New York Giants, Bill Parcells repeatedly blasted Phil Simms on the sidelines. Terry Bradshaw and Chuck Noll had such a contentious union that they barely spoke for 20 years after Bradshaw retired. But Holmgren, Parcells and Noll all believed they were working with quarterbacks capable of achieving greatness. Gruden does not share that view about Griffin. If Griffin were willing to remain in the background, perhaps Gruden could tolerate having him on the roster as a backup next season. But Griffin craves attention. The spotlight always finds him  or he makes sure it does. The belief around the league is that for Griffin to have any hope of reviving his career, he must get his priorities in order. To say the least, the Redskins wont have a ton of leverage in trying to trade Griffin.     View Graphic    The team has played 14 players this season in the back end of the defense with varied results.  Considering Grudens firm stance, though, trading Griffin is the logical option. And if Snyder and Allen drag their feet or tell Gruden he must give Griffin one more chance, then Gruden may have to come up with an exit strategy even faster than Mike Shanahan did. Realizing he faces a formidable challenge, Gruden is eager to roll up his sleeves. To help Gruden get the job done, Snyder and Allen should remove the albatross around his neck.

The Washington Post,L,Residents of Prince Georges have waited too long for improved medical facilities - The Washington Post,"   Maryland and Prince George's County are planning a $645 million regional hospital campus in Largo. (Courtesy of Prince George's County)   By Editorial Board December 4 at 8:53 PM   PRINCE GEORGES County is a place on the move. Violent crime has plummeted, competent officials hold office, the FBI is considering building its headquarters in the county and one of the worlds biggest gaming companies is building a casino and resort complex worth nearly $1 billion at National Harbor. Amid all that dynamic change, Prince Georges long-standing effort to build a first-class hospital remains stuck.  More than three years after county and state officials struck a deal with the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), a highly regarded nonprofit hospital network, to revamp Prince Georges run-down health-care facilities, final approval is still pending for a facility in Largo that could offer first-rate care to a community where it is still lacking. A three-way funding deal is in place for the $650 million, 200-bed medical center, with the state, county and a partnership of UMMS and Dimensions Healthcare System each on the hook for a third of the tab. Its important that Gov.-elect Larry Hogan (R), who grew up in Prince Georges County (and whose father served as county executive), reaffirm the states support for this badly needed facility. Prince Georges County is Marylands second-largest jurisdiction. Its population exceeds that of San Francisco, Detroit, Seattle, Denver, Boston  and the District. Without a first-rate hospital, many of the countys 900,000 people seek health care elsewhere. Of some 32,000 Marylanders who were admitted to out-of-state hospitals in 2011, about three-quarters of them were Prince Georgians who were treated at hospitals in the District. Many others sought care in Montgomery County and other neighboring localities. That exodus of patients from the county is the result of years of decline and decay at county-owned health facilities  principally Prince Georges Hospital Center. With the heavy burden of nonpaying and uninsured patients who seek treatment in the emergency wards, the facilities have been on life support, subsidized by the state and county to the tune of $30 million annually. Meanwhile, county residents in search of top-flight medical specialists and ambulatory care go elsewhere for the kinds of treatment that generate revenue for hospitals, such as heart surgery and other complex procedures. The proposed regional medical center on a 26-acre site in Largo Town Center would improve the quality of health care available in the county. With room for a research facility and medical offices, it would be a catalyst for economic development. The project is awaiting final approval by state regulators, who want to ensure that its costs and prices will be manageable. At least two large hospital systems in neighboring jurisdictions, which would face new competition for patients and profits, are opposing the facility. Still, county officials remain hopeful that it is on track for approval early next year. It deserves approval. Prince Georges ratio of primary-care physicians to population lags every neighboring jurisdiction. The countys residents are badly underserved. The new medical center would go a long way to addressing that shortcoming and accelerating Prince Georges already impressive transformation.

The Washington Post,L,"The remarkable collapse of our trust in government, in one chart - The Washington Post"," By Chris Cillizza December 4 at 10:31 AM  Follow @thefix   No one likes -- or trusts -- the government. At this point, that's accepted conventional wisdom. And most people assume it has always been like that. (We have a tendency to assume whatever is happening to us right now has always been happening.) But that lack of trust hasn't always been a part of the American experience -- as this awesome chart from our friends at the Pew Research Center shows. The line below charts the percentage of people who have told Pew they trust the government ""just about always"" or ""most of the time"".     The downward trajectory is stark. The collapse began during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, which, not coincidentally, overlapped with the Vietnam War. The 1970s -- thanks to Vietnam and Watergate -- sped up the loss of faith in the government. And, after a quasi-resurgence during the 1980s, the trend line for the past few decades is quite clear. With the exception of relatively brief spikes that overlap with the first Gulf War and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the number of people who trust the government has been steadily declining; the last time Pew asked the question, in February, just 24 percent said they trust the government ""always"" or ""most of the time"". Exit polling from the 2014 midterms makes clear that things haven't improved in the trust department since that Pew poll. Just 20 percent said they trusted the government to do what's right ""always"" or ""most"" of the time, while 79 percent said they trusted the government only ""some"" of the time or ""never."" The collapse of our collective trust in the government -- and, by extension, its ability or willingness to help solve problems -- has massive reverberations for politicians. They are considered less-than-honest brokers by large numbers of the American public, meaning that everything they say or do is viewed with suspicion. That's a tough starting place for any pol. But, if the chart above is any indication, it's the new normal."
The Washington Post,L,"DARRIN BELL: From Ferguson to New York cases, Candorville cartoonist draws deeply from the personal [Q&A] - The Washington Post"," By Michael Cavna December 4 at 10:32 AM  Follow @comicriffs      Political cartoons by DARRIN BELL (courtesy of the artist/WPWG)   FOR DARRIN BELL, the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and Tamir Rice at the hands of police strike a personal chord. When he draws cartoons about such tragic incidents, he remembers the talk he once had with his mother  and anticipates the talk he will one day need to have with his own son. My mother, whos white, had the talk with me when I was around 6 or 7, Bell, a political cartoonist and creator of the stripCandorville, tells The Posts Comic Riffs. She was terrified because shed caught me playing with a water gun another kid had loaned me. It looked like a real gun. She told me Im a lot more likely to be shot by police than my friend was if they saw me with it, because police tend to think little black boys  even light-skinned ones  are older than they really are, and less innocent than they really are. We have studies now that prove this, Bell continues, but at the time, that was her perception, growing up as she did in the 50s and 60s, I thought she was living in the past. As Bell reads about, and editorially responds to, the recent high-profile killings of black males by officers, he is reminded that more than one cycle continues. Its personal because Im going to have to have that talk with my baby boy in about seven or eight years, about how to behave when police are around, so as not to provoke them  , the Southern California-based cartoonist says, and thats the kind of talk a parent should only have to have with his child with regard to pitbulls. Comic Riffs caught up with Bell (author of the Trayvon Martin-alluding Does the Afterlife Have Skittles?) to talk about his personal experiences and professional responses in the wake of the latest no-indictment decision involving a white officer and a black man turned fatality: MICHAEL CAVNA: Youre so adept at turning around editorial ideas, and art, quickly. Could you walk us through how you approached thus cartoon once you heard [Wednesday's] Eric Garner/NYPD no-indictment news? DARRIN BELL: There was so much I wanted to say. So many points I wanted to make. I wanted to comment on the difference between how authorities arrest white-collar criminals and the average suspect  especially when that suspect is an average minority. I wanted to address how body cameras will be useless if even a high-quality video of a senseless killing by police doesnt sway a jury. I wanted to compare it to Ferguson and say it doesnt matter whether a large, unarmed black man is moving toward the cop  as [Officer Darren] Wilson alleged Brown did  or moving away from the officer, as Garner clearly did in the video. The officer just might see him as a mortal threat either way. I wanted to follow up on the Ferguson grand jury cartoon [I drew] by showing that graffiti being etched in stone, because its possible the Ferguson ruling set a precedent  raised the bar significantly from discovering probable cause to discovering guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Its not a trend yet  three would make a trend  but these two rulings at first glance seem to encroach on the duties of trial juries. I wanted to comment on how far we wouldnt have to travel along the jackboot spectrum to cover the distance between unaccountable law enforcement and police state. I wanted to comment on all that. But whenever I have several competing ideas I want to get across, that tells me my ideas are just planets orbiting a star, and its really the star I should be commenting on. Thats when its time to (at the risk of mixing metaphors) put it all in a crucible and burn away everything until Im left with the common denominator. Thats how I arrived at this cartoon.       MC:  Your new cartoon of course also speaks to Ferguson. You had a verbally spun Ferguson cartoon the other day [above]. Do you find yourself having a sad and unfortunate wealth of ideas lately on this issue? DB: I do, and its one of those times when I really, really hope I wont have a chance to make use of any of my ideas. But then people keep giving me more chances. MC:  Sometimes I draw editorial cartoons from the head, sometimes from the heart  some are methodical, some are emotional  depending on my connection to the material. How personal, or not, are these Ferguson and NYPD cartoons to you as subject matter? DB: Theyre personal, because every time police brutality and police killings of unarmed black men make it into the news, the reaction is the same: Some people reflexively argue that the guy mustve had it coming. Raising your arm to deflect the blow of a baton becomes an aggressive movement. A screwdriver in your backpack becomes a burglary tool. Everything youve ever done wrong  including ever having been suspended from school  is dug up and becomes proof, in some quarters, that you were a scumbag  a rabid animal who needed to be put down. Its personal because I know that if I were ever to be killed by police, I would receive the same treatment. Even though Im the kind of guy who smiles, says, Yes, officer, makes no sudden movements, gives them whatever documents they ask for and keeps his hands in plain view at all times.  If one of them shot me, plenty of people would assume I provoked it somehow. And the cop would almost certainly not be held accountable. Its personal because Im going to have to have that talk with my baby boy in about seven or eight years about how to behave when police are around, so as not to provoke them. And thats the kind of talk a parent should only have to have with his child with regard to pitbulls. MC: You lived in the L.A. during the Rodney King verdict, and your [late] granddad might have spoken [to you about] the areas Watts Riots. In what sort of historical context do you put recent riots over police actions and justice in relation to those key times in L.A. history?  DB: Riots are insane. But the thing is, when you know theres a historical pattern of this sort of thing happening  when you see it happen again and again before your eyes and so many people not only dont care, but blame the victim  and you know that tomorrow it can be you or your child that it happens to, and that the ones who do it can do it with impunity, that drives you a little crazy. Rioting is wrong. Rioting is self-defeating, and far less effective than sustained, nonviolent protest. But its also a natural reaction to being abused by authorities and having nowhere to turn for justice. America has a LONG history of rioting, by white people as well as black. The LA Riots were one of those spontaneous eruptions of frustration and rage, and then opportunists swooped in to take advantage of the situation and get free stuff. That happened in Ferguson too. Every uprising has that: people who are genuinely outraged and flailing in blind rage at the status quo because they cant take any more  and leeches who come along for the ride. Thats not unique to riots  thats human nature. In politics, youve got statesmen trying to govern, and crooks trying to score. In business, youve got people trying to build a fortune and build up the country, and along for the ride are people trying to build their fortune by stealing what little other people have. In war, youve got soldiers trying to win and live, and youve got those whore out to pillage and loot. And in policing, youve got the majority who are trying to serve and protect, and then along for the ride are those who abuse, steal  sorry, confiscate  and murder. Rioters arent the only ones who take advantage. Theyre not even the most common.    CANDORVILLE (2012 courtesy of Darrin Bell/WPWG)  MC: You created an especially memorable Candorville week of Trayvons post-life train ride. Do you have any plans to handle these two police deaths from the summer, and the no-indictments, in future strips?  DB: Yes, but not those two in particular, because those two arent isolated incidents. MC: What do you hope to most communicate to your readers about the state of things on this issue, as a commentator  if not also as a citizen and father? DB: The reason those incidents in particular  and all the incidents that happened in this long, hot summer and fall  provoked such frustration and anger is, theyre representative of what happens regularly in this country. It happens to white people, too, but white people tend to trust the police more than black people do, so they assume in those cases that it was either justified, or an awful mistake that was nobodys fault. When the Arizona police executed that homeless man who was trying to gather his belongings and leave, as theyd told him to, I expected outrage, and I was ready to comment on it. But America paid attention for a few hours and then shrugged its collective shoulders and forgot about it. Outrage only happens when you notice that abuse of power  which encompasses an entire spectrum from unfair traffic stops, to confiscation of valuables and cash without cause, to cops in your neighborhood thinking they have a right to poke their heads out of their windows and demand to know where youre going, to brutality and finally killing  happens regularly. Outrage happens when you realize that isolated incident and happens regularly are mutually exclusive concepts. Most police, from what I can tell, are honorable and genuinely trying to just do their job, help people and make it home at the end of the day. But the problem is, they protect their own. Theyre comfortable being part of a system that protects the bad apples among them from accountability. They dont snitch. Thats why plenty of people whove grown up around gangs view the police as just another  better-armed  gang. But its wrong to stereotype cops, to profile them all based on the actions of just a few. Just as its wrong to profile people like Eric Garner, to consider a black man to be potentially a violent threat you have to erase just because hes large and has sold untaxed cigarettes in the past. MC: Anything youd like to add, from opinions to [personal] anecdotes? DB: This is something I never told my mother, because I was certain shed never let me go play outside alone again. In light of all thats happened, I think its relevant here: My mother, whos white, had the talk with me when I was around 6 or 7. She was terrified because shed caught me playing with a water gun another kid had loaned me. It looked like a real gun. She told me Im a lot more likely to be shot by police than my friend was if they saw me with it, because police tend to think little black boys  even light-skinned ones  are older than they really are, and less innocent than they really are. We have studies now that prove this, but at the time, that was her perception, growing up as she did in the 50s and 60s. I thought she was living in the past. And I resented what happened next: She took me to the corner store and bought me a bright-green, transparent plastic water gun. It was humiliating. But she said it would keep me alive, because the police would never mistake it for a real gun. A few weeks later, I walked by myself to the pizza parlor around the corner to play some video games. Along the way, I decided I was Han Solo and I kept shooting the bushes, the fire hydrant  and every other inanimate object I could pretend was a Stormtrooper  with my water gun. The only time I stopped shooting was when I knelt down by the side of the road to reload my bright-green, transparent gun in a puddle. I dont recall the sound of the voice that said PUT IT DOWN, but I still remember the officers sunglasses, his tie clip, and his hand on his unholstered weapon. I remember standing and freezing. I remember it seemed like it took forever before he holstered his weapon and walked toward me. I remember him saying something about complaints, asking me where I was going, asking me over and over where I lived and what I was doing here. I remember him taking away my bright-green, transparent water gun, saying something else to me, and leaving. I remember running home; and I remember wanting to thank my mom for taking away that realistic gun, but instead going straight to my room because I didnt want her to decide I could never leave home alone again.

The Washington Post,L,The loss of Rep. Mike Rogers as head of the House Intelligence Committee is a blow to bipartisanship - The Washington Post,"   FILE - In this May 17, 2013 file photo, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington. Republicans retained control of the House in this weeks election, but because of retirements and party-imposed term limits on committee chairmen, more than half a dozen committees will be getting new chairmen. (Charles Dharapak/AP)     By David Ignatius Opinion writer December 4 at 8:09 PM  Follow @ignatiuspost     The House intelligence committee, a rare island of bipartisanship in recent years, may soon become a more confrontational arena with the retirement of its chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers. Rogers (R-Mich.) is scheduled to be replaced by Rep. Devin Nunes, a conservative California Republican whose critical comments about Benghazi made him a favorite with Fox News. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) announced the Nunes appointment two weeks ago in what appeared to be a concession to right-wing Republicans who want a more adversarial role for this key committee.  David Ignatius writes a twice-a-week foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog. View Archive   Facebook RSS   A sign of what may lie ahead is that Nunes hasnt publicly endorsed the intelligence committees report last month that cleared the CIA, the military and top Obama administration officials of wrongdoing in the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi. This report, by Rogerss committee, was the latest debunking of the Benghazi issue, but it did little to convince conservative Republicans. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called the report a C.Y.A. attempt designed to protect incompetent politicians and government agents. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN: I think the report is full of crap. In November 2013, Nunes sent Boehner a list of critical outstanding questions about Benghazi, including such explosive issues as possible witness intimidation. But, perhaps unknown to Nunes, sources say the committee had already received evidence that rebutted those allegations. The leadership change on the House panel comes at a delicate time, as the intelligence community is coping with severe challenges, including the Islamic States takeover of northern Iraq and Syria and Russias aggression in Ukraine. Intelligence agency officials worry that if bipartisan cooperation is lost in the House, the oversight process may become politicized again, as it often was under previous chairmen. Rogers has been a noteworthy exception to the culture of dysfunction on Capitol Hill. When he became committee chairman in 2011, he made a pact with Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, the ranking Democrat, to avoid the political grandstanding that had paralyzed the committee for years. By working together, Rogers and Ruppersberger (Md.) managed to pass an intelligence authorization bill in 2011, the first such legislation in six years, and to do so every year since. They began by stripping politically charged amendments from the measure, including language on climate change, use of contractors and Guantanamo. He insisted on joint budget briefings by Republican and Democratic staff members. Boehners decision to pick Nunes over other Republicans who wanted the job surprised some members, given that the speaker had chosen Rogers and defended him from right-wing criticism. A Nunes spokesman said that the new chairman intends to consult closely with Democrats. He said that Nunes hadnt taken a position on the Benghazi report because the committee had to operate one chairman at a time. Rogers, a former FBI agent, decided to retire from the House this year and become a radio talk-show host, perhaps in part to build a broader political base. He has become one of the most prominent Republican voices on foreign policy and intelligence issues, appearing 27 times on the Sunday TV interview shows in 2013, more than any other guest. Rogers has often criticized President Obama on foreign policy issues, but he has generally backed the intelligence community. He has been especially supportive of James Clapper, a career intelligence officer who is director of national intelligence. In an interview this week, Rogers said Clapper had performed the best of any DNI since the job was created in 2005. Rogers said that, in his view, the jury is still out on CIA Director John Brennan. Can he shake off the umbilical cord to the White House? Rogers asked. Brennan served as Obamas adviser on intelligence for four years before becoming CIA director. Rogers said that he hoped Brennan wouldnt rush into a new plan for reorganizing the CIA that would merge analysts and operators into geographical units. Its important that the House and Senate intelligence committees operate effectively, with bipartisan trust, because the intelligence community badly needs constructive oversight. When the members and staffs work together, they can hold the agencies accountable; when they bicker, its harder to maintain that accountability. Rogers has been a pragmatic committee chairman of the sort that once dominated Congress but has become a disappearing species. The inertia of todays Washington troubles him. Weve gotten to the place where people would rather have zero progress than 75 percent. I dont understand that, he told me. Unfortunately, this voice for adult supervision of intelligence is about to hand in his gavel.

The Washington Post,L,Bill Cosbys honorary title revoked by U.S. Navy - The Washington Post," By Amy Argetsinger December 4 at 2:30 PM  Follow @AmyArgetsinger      Bill Cosby, center, is recognized as an honorary Chief Petty Officer by Master Chief Petty Officer Rick West, left, and Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus on Feb. 17, 2011. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)  The thing about honorary titles is that theyre just that  honorary. They come with no salary, no responsibilities, just clap on the back and maybe a plaque. So even when the honoree turns out to be less than worthy, usually no demotion is in order. But the U.S. Navy is taking the honorary title it bestowed upon Bill Cosby in 2011 very seriously  seriously enough to revoke it. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Michael Stevens announced Thursday that they are revoking Cosbys title of honorary Chief Petty Officer after multiple accusations of sexual abuse by the comedian made news. In a press release, officials explained that the Navy is taking this action because allegations against Mr. Cosby are very serious and are in conflict with the Navys core values of honor, courage and commitment. Cosby served for four years in the Navy as a young man, never making it past hospital corpsman third-class. But his fond recollections of his long-ago service impressed military brass. In September 2010, he accepted a Lone Sailor Award from U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation, which annually honors vets who achieved greatness in their post-military careers. The often-cantankerous comedian delighted the gala crowd by unexpectedly doing several minutes of stand-up about his sailor days. Five months later, he returned to Washington and did an extended version of that riff for an audience of both enlisted folks and brass at the Navy Memorial. In a brief ceremony, Mabus and Rick West, who then held the post of master chief petty officer, attached shoulderboards to his shirt, signifying that he was a CPO, and helped him into a dress blue jacket. Of course, the military, too, has grappled with a wave of sexual assault reports that have been under close scrutiny from the White House and Congress recently; and as other organizations cut their affiliations with Cosby, the military community was buzzing last week about his Navy connections. Navy officials did not respond to the Posts Checkpoint blog for comment last Friday. Heres the full statement released by the Navy on Thursday: Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Michael Stevens today said the Navy is revoking Bill Cosbys title of honorary Chief Petty Officer, originally presented in 2011. The Navy is taking this action because allegations against Mr. Cosby are very serious and are in conflict with the Navys core values of honor, courage and commitment. Cosby enlisted in the Navy in 1956 and served for four years as a hospital corpsman before being honorably discharged in 1960 as a 3rd Class Petty Officer.  See earlier on Checkpoint blog: Former sailor Bill Cosby and the Navy have history together. Now its complicated. "
The Washington Post,L,"This flu season could be a bad one, CDC says - The Washington Post"," By Lenny Bernstein December 4 at 3:48 PM  Follow @LennyMBernstein      A flu virus binds to cells in the respiratory tract. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)  This post has been updated. Anticipating a severe flu season, the government on Thursday recommended immediate vaccination for anyone who hasn't taken that precaution and urged people who come down with the flu to seek anti-viral medication from their doctors. The flu has already killed five children, and the predominant strain of the virus circulating now was associated with severe outbreaks, including larger than normal numbers of deaths and hospitalizations, during three flu seasons over the past 11 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced. The anti-viral medications oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) may be particularly important this year. A CDC study of the flu viruses now circulating showed that the vaccine may have limited effectiveness against more than half of the most common one, H3N2, the CDC said. Yet fewer than 1in 6people infected by the flu virus are treated with anti-viral medications, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. Anti-viral drugs ""aren't a substitute for vaccine. Vaccine prevents flu,"" Frieden said. ""But anti-virals are an important second line of defense and this year treatment with anti-viral drugs is especially important."" That is particularly true for children under age 2, adults older than 65, pregnant women and people with other health conditions that leave them more vulnerable to the flu, including asthma, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Residents of nursing homes and the morbidly obese also should receive the treatment. Frieden noted that anti-viral drugs work best if they are taken within two days of infection and urged patients and doctors to turn to them quickly. He also emphasized that people with the flu should stay home to avoid spreading it. Before each flu season, experts try to predict the kinds of virus that will circulate in the United States and drug companies produce vaccines with three or four components to combat them. But the effort is always something of a guessing game and this year, tests are finding that more than half the H3N2 viruses are antigenically different from the vaccine component, or ""drifted"" from it, in CDC parlance. The vaccine still should provide some protection against those viruses and will be effective against the others, according to the CDC. The ""drifted"" virus was first detected in March, too late to be included in this season's vaccine, Frieden said. H3N2 viruses predominated during the flu seasons of 2003-2004, 2007-2008 and 2012-2013, when the largest number of deaths were recorded over the past decade. The flu is still at low levels in the United States, but 1,228 confirmed cases were reported to the CDC during the week that ended Nov. 22. ""The flu is unpredictable,"" Frieden said. This is ""likely to be an H3N2 predominant season  and H3N2 predominant seasons tend to have more hospitalizations and more deaths."" "

The Washington Post,L,The racial divide in America is this elemental: Blacks and whites actually breathe different air. - The Washington Post," By Max Ehrenfreund December 4 at 10:49 AM  Follow @MaxEhrenfreund      American Lung Association  There's a profound truth to one of the mottoes ofprotesters in New York who areupset about agrand jury's decision not to indict an officer in the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island this summer.""We can't breathe,"" they have been chanting. And in New York, as in most American cities, the air itself has been tainted by decades of disparity inpublic policy. The motto paraphrases Garner's words as Officer Daniel Pantaleo held him in an apparent chokehold on the sidewalk. Pantaleo told the grand jury he did not intend to choke Garner and tried to let go of him when Garner said, ""I can't breathe,"" but the asthmatic Garner suffered a heart attack and died severalminutes later in the back of ambulance. Amedical examiner ruled the death a homicide. We'll never know if Garner would have survived the altercationif he hadn't had asthma. We also don't know what caused the asthma, which he developed as a child. What we do know is that asthma is much more common among blacks than whites, andthat air pollution is much worse in communities of color nationwide. Asthma was one among many factors correlated with racein Garner's life that led to thefatal situation, said Eddie Bautista, director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance. ""There are number of ways that racism plays out,"" he said. ""The asthma is just one more example."" A recent study found that members of racial and ethnic minorities are exposedto levels of nitrogen dioxide, a common pollutant associated with asthma and heart disease, that are 38 percent higher than in the air whites breathe. Advocates say that authoritiesoften decide to dump waste in minorityneighborhoods, and to locate highways and industrial facilities away from the higher-income areas wherewhites live. Garner lived in Tompkinsville, a neighborhood on Staten Island's north shore where zoning regulations have concentratedshipping and industry, Bautista said. The north shore of the islandis one of six areasthatNew York Cityhas designated formarinefreight. Bautista's group analyzed the demographics of these zones and found thatabout two-thirds of the people living in them were not white. Historically, he said, immigrants and people of color moved to these waterfront neighborhoods becausethey could live and find work there despite a lack of money and qualifications. More recently, as the city has converted industrial land elsewhere into gentrifying residential and commercial neighborhoods, industry has further concentrated in the waterfront districts,likely leading to moreasthma-causing pollutants. ""The more industrial land you take off the table, the less land you have, the greater the potential for clustering. It's a vicious cycle,"" Bautista said. In one neighborhood, Hunts Point and Mott Haven in the Bronx, the rate at which children are hospitalized for asthma is about twice the city's average. Pollution is not the only cause of asthma. Psychological factors play a role as well, including anxiety, stress and exposure to violence. Children who live in neighborhoods where crime is high have been shown to have higher rates of asthma.For people living in old, poorly maintained houses,exposure to cockroaches is another risk: the insects produce allergens that mightcause asthma in children.

The Washington Post,L,"New York Mayor, police union officials clash after grand jury decision in Eric Garners death - The Washington Post"," By Elahe Izadi December 4 at 5:48 PM  Follow @ElaheIzadi      New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks at a press conference after watching police being retrained with new guidelines at the Police Academy on Thursday in Queens. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)  Tensions between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and some in the citys police force came into full view Thursday, as police union officials accused the mayor of throwingthe departmentunder the bus in his response to a grand jurys decision to not indict a white officer in Eric Garners killing. Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus, Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmens Benevolent Association, said at a Thursday press conference. Look, last night, the protesters  we may not agree with their message, but we were protecting their right to do it. Thats what they should be saying. De Blasio pushed back, thankingprotesters for an overwhelmingly peaceful protest on Wednesday night that resulted in 83 arrests, and praisingofficers. The response by the New York Police Departmentwas exactly the right one. It was smart, it was strategic, it was agile. A lot of restraint was shown, the mayor said as he announced a massive refresher training for the nations largest police force in the wake of Garners death. This is a sign of respect for the professionof policing, de Blasio said of the training. We put so many other professions on a pedestal andput a huge amount on training. This is a profession that deserves more support. RELATED: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio pens an open letter after the Eric Garner decision: There is much more to be done. Starting this month, all20,000 members of the citys patrol force, including 2,500 sergeants and 900 lieutenants, willundergo a three-day training course that will include learning conflict-resolution skills and how to deescalate situations with methods other than force. Fundamental questions are being asked, and rightfully so, about how we respect peoples rights, how we reduce the use of force and the relationship between police and community, de Blasio said. The mayor declined to comment on whether such training would avoid a repeat of what happened between Garner and Officer Daniel Pantaleo, but he said that it will lead to a very different reality. This will protect our officers, protect lives of our citizens, de Blasio said. I have no doubt that some tragedies will be averted because of this training.    A man distributes fliers to police officers at a protest in New Yorks Union Square on Wednesday. (Kena Betancur/Getty Images)  After the grand jury declined to bring charges against Pantaleo, de Blasio met with clergy and others in Staten Island on Wednesday and then spoke about his personal fear that his African American son would fall victim to police brutality. Lynch said Thursday thatthe mayorinstead should have beentelling residents to not resist arrest because itcan lead to dangerous and sometimes tragic outcomes for officers and civilians alike. An internal department review will begin into whetherPantaleo violated department conduct policies, just as the Justice Department launches a civil rights probe into the death of Garner, a 43-year-old unarmed black man, which was captured on video obtained by the Daily News and sparked mass outrage and an eventual investigation. Ajudge also ordered the release of a verylimited amount of information about the grand jury investigation, per a request fromRichmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan. That information includes the fact that jurors sat for a period of nine weeks; heard from 50 witnesses, with 22 being civilians and the rest officers, emergency personnel and doctors; and considered 60 exhibits, which included four videos. The judge noted that much of that information had already been widely reported in the media.      The president of the union that represents New York City police officers praised Wednesday's grand jury decision in Staten Island not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the choking death of Eric Garner last summer. (AP)   Donovan had not asked for transcripts of testimony or the exhibits to be made public.In a statement,Donovan said he had no further comment on the grand jury investigation. Union officials and de Blasio did agree on one thing: that more information related to the grand jury decision should be released. Pantaleo has no qualms if that information is released, because its the truth, Lynch said. He would like everyone to hear what the grand jurors heard. "

The Washington Post,L,Expect large crowds for downtown events - The Washington Post," By Robert Thomson December 4 at 9:15 AM  Follow @RT_Thomson    Two separate events near each other in the heart of downtown Washington will put crowds on the streets and add to traffic congestion, particularly during the Thursday afternoon rush. Many Metrobus routes will be detoured or delayed. Drivers who just want to get through the area should steer clear of the John A. Wilson Building (A on the map) on Pennsylvania Avenue and the Ellipse (B on the map) south of the White House. Here are the travel details for each event. John A. Wilson Building The body of former D.C. mayor Marion Barry will lie in repose at the Wilson Building until midnight in the first of three days of remembrance ceremonies. The Wilson Building is on the south side of Freedom Plaza, on Pennsylvania Avenue between 13th and 14th streets NW. See more from Mike DeBonis about plans for the memorials. Metrorail is likely to be the easiest approach for those attending. The stations nearest to the Wilson Building are Federal Triangle and Metro Center. This page on the Parking Panda Web site can help drivers who want to find and reserve garage parking nearby. The transit authority said it expects the activity around the Wilson Building to disrupt service on these Metrobus routes: 30N, 30S, 32, 33, 36, 37, 39, A9, D1, P17, P19, W13. See this page on Metros Web site for details on route changes and skipped stops. The Ellipse The annual lighting ceremony for the National Christmas Tree is set to begin at 4:30 p.m. on the Ellipse. The event usually lasts till about 7 p.m. Several street closings for the event setup are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. Thursday and continue till 10 p.m. The streets to be closed are 15th and 17th between Constitution Avenue and E Street NW. This alone would be enough to disrupt the evening rush hour, but those closings will be extended from 4 p.m. through the end of the ceremony. During those hours, 15th Street NW will be blocked to vehicles between New York and Constitution avenues, 17th Street NW will be blocked between Constitution Avenue and New York Avenue/State Place, and 18th Street NW will be closed to vehicles between D and E streets. The diverted traffic will make congestion even worse than normal throughout the area near the White House and Ellipse. The nearest Metrorail stations are McPherson Square, Farragut West, Metro Center and Federal Triangle. For paid parking options in the vicinity, check this page on Parking Panda. But remember that the closer you get to the Ellipse, the more likely you are to be caught in extra heavy rush hour traffic. Metrobus delays because of the extra traffic can be widespread, affecting routes that link the District with Maryland and Virginia. The transit authority expects these routes will be subject to delays and unplanned detours: 3Y, 7Y, 11Y, 16X, 16Y, 30N, 30S, 32, 36, 37, 38B, 39, 42, 43, 52, 53, 54, 80, D1, D3, D5, D6, G8, H1, L1, N2, N3, N4, P6, P17, P19, S1, S2, S4, S9, W13, X1 and X2. Routes H1, L1 and N3 will begin service at C and 18th streets NW. The X1 will begin service at the 10th Street terminal. Routes 11Y, G8, P17, P19, W13 and X2 will begin service at Franklin Square. Some S2 and S4 buses will turn back near Franklin Square. See more details about the disrupted schedules on Metros Web site. The OmniRide commuter bus service plans to make these adjustments on Thursday afternoon: Beginning at 2 p.m., buses will pick up passengers only from the Franconia-Springfield Metro station for eastern Prince William County and at Tysons Corner Metro station for Manassas, Gainesville and Linton Hall. All the regular drop-off points will be served. Service from the Metro stations will continue until 7:30 p.m. except for Prince William and Manassas Metro Direct buses, which will continue operating until their last published departure time. The Maryland Transit Administration advises its riders to expect significant delays through downtown, especially on routes near the White House and the Wilson Building."
The Washington Post,L,"Plunging oil prices spell trouble for Alaska, Americas own petro-state - The Washington Post"," By Steven Mufson December 4 at 10:10 AM  Follow @StevenMufson      Low oil prices are bringing a mountain of budget troubles to Alaska's state government. (Photo by Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)  What U.S. state is as hooked on oil revenues as Venezuela, Iran, or Russia? Alaska. Plunging oil prices have blown a huge hole in the budget of the oil-rich state, where in recent years taxes on oil production have covered more than half the total budget ($13.5 billion including federal funds and capital projects) and 90 percent of the state's discretionary spending ($6.5 billion to run agencies and schools). Now, with prices under $70 a barrel, the budget deficit could balloon to more than $3 billion, about half of the states discretionary spending level. In his inaugural address earlier this week, Gov. Bill Walker recounted his impoverished childhood and his familys determination to make ends meet after losing almost everything in the 1964 earthquake. It was an allegory for Alaska's current situation. Today, oil is hovering around $70 a barrel, he said. Were heading into some lean times. There is no reason we cannot turn that around. Turning it around could be difficult. Ever since the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field starting production in 1977, Alaska has relied heavily on oil revenues. Les Gara, a member of the Alaska state legislature, said that the oil price would have to hit $110 a barrel for the state government to break even. ""No one wants to pay high prices for gasoline, but at the same time we want to fund our roads and schools and opportunities for young people,"" Gara said. Alaskans, especially those in remote areas, pay some of the highest prices in the country for basic goods, such as milk or gasoline. And before oil prices jumped to record high levels over the past four years, Alaska was running far behind on maintenance projects and provided little education aid for its residents. ""While low oil prices are very good for consumers whether in rural Alaska where people rely on diesel fuel or across the country, it is terrible for finding ways to fund disadvantaged kids, foster youth programs, or pre-kindergarten education,"" said Gara. ""So its a mixed bag for Alaskans."" The new governor Walker has said he would review several controversial expensive projects such as the Knik Arm Bridge, Juneau Access, and Susitna Dam. He also favors taking federal money for Medicaid, which his predecessor opposed. But don't cry for Alaska too much. The state has built up three different rainy day funds  two of which are dedicated to covering deficits in lean years and the third a sacrosanct $51 billion Permanent Fund, which every year writes checks to every person living in Alaska. On Oct. 2, payments of $1,884 each werepaid out. The wisdom of building up such funds was supposed to make Alaska look more like Norway, which has a huge oil-financed investment fund, and less like Venezuela. However, the Permanent Fund is not supposed to be touched to fill budget gaps; it is supposed to help Alaskan families as production in Prudhoe Bay declines. And the two rainy day funds are running a little dry. The Constitutional Budget Reserve was worth $11.8 billion on Oct 31 and the Statutory Budget Reserve was worth $3.7 billion. But the state legislature has voted to transfer $3 billion from those funds to cover part of a $12 billion gap in state's pension funds; Alaska has the seventh worst pension funding shortfall in the United States, according to a Bloomberg News report. Another $3 billion will go to cover the deficit in the fiscal year that will end June 2015. That will leave the Constitutional Budget Reserve with about $9.5 billion, barely more than the remaining pension fund shortfall. ""And thats assuming todays oil prices continue, which is a wild card,"" said Gara. "
The Washington Post,L,Many liberals and conservatives find themselves on common ground following the Garner decision - The Washington Post," By Katie Zezima December 4 at 7:45 PM  Follow @katiezez   Controversial court rulings are often followed by protests. Or confrontation. Or social unrest. This week's decision by a grand jury not to indict a New York City police officer in the death of a Staten Island man added an unexpected entry to the list: rare bipartisan consensus. Opinions on a grand jury's decision not to bring charges against a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager were largely split along party lines. Republicans generally approved the decision, while many Democrats did not. The political reaction to a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in thedeath of Eric Garner, who died after the officer put him in a choke hold, has resulted in a rare consensus, with both conservatives and liberals reacting with outrage to the decision. ""There is no excuse that I can think of for choking a man to death for selling illegal cigarettes,"" wrote Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. ""This is someone being choked to death. We have it on video with the man pleading for his life. There is no excuse for that I can even contemplate or imagine right now."" Garner, who died July 17, was being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes on Staten Island. An officer, Daniel Pantaleo, used a chokehold to bring Garner down. His actions were caught on a video, with Garner repeatedly saying, ""I can't breathe."" He later died, and a medical examiner determined the chokehold and compression to Garner's chest had caused his death, which was ruled a homicide. Pantaleo told the grand jury thathe had used a wrestling move and did not meant to cause Garner harm. The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Garner's death. So why has this case sparked outrage among some conservatives? First, there's the video evidence -- the dramatic footage showing Garner telling police that he cannot breathe. ""From looking at the video, the grand jurys decision here is totally incomprehensible,"" conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said on FOX News Monday. Krauthammer also pointed to another source of conservative dissatisfaction with the case. ""[Garner] was selling loose cigarettes, which is in and of itself almost absurdthat somebody has to die over that."" Conservatives oppose what they see as government over-regulation, and excessive taxation -- and to many of them, the Garner case represents both. More than a few on the right say the sale of loose, untaxed cigarettes should not be a crime, pointing to New York's extremely high cigarette tax, which has driven a sizable chunk of the market underground. New York City increased penalties for selling loose and untaxed tobacco earlier this year. The results of big government, #NannyStateEnforcement, and @MikeBloomberg s excise tax > #EricGarner . Appalling and obscene.  Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) December 3, 2014 The reaction on Capitol Hill has also been strikingly similar from many on both sides of the aisle. Clearly excessive force against #EricGarner. I pray that peace and justice will prevail.  Justin Amash (@repjustinamash) December 4, 2014  Sen. Rand Paul, speaking on ""Hardball"" Tuesday, said he was ""horrified"" by the video. But, as he did following the Ferguson decision, he placed much of the blame on politicians: those who enacted New York's high cigarette tax, and others who directed police to arrest those selling individual, tax-free cigarettes. On Wednesday he told CNN he was ""shocked"" by the grand jury's decision in New York. ""I don't think it's justified what the police did, but I also think it's bad policy that puts the police in an untenable position. The War on Drugs"" -- which he pointed to in the Michael Brown case as well -- ""does that, and so does an erroneous and excessive tax policy as well,"" he said. Rep. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-Wash.), the House's fourth-ranking Republican, said she thinks the body should hold hearings into Garner's death. We all have a lot of serious questions that need to be addressed and we need to understand what happened, why this decision was made, she said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Thursday. ""I would call for the House to have those hearings so that we can better understand. But we need to take action, appropriate action, making sure our local law enforcement have the training, that they're using appropriate force, which  I think we all recognize these are tragedies and it has raised a lot of questions."" Sean Davis at conservative publication The Federalist wrote, ""The grand jurys decision not to bringanycharges against the officer who killed Garner is inexplicable. It defies reason. It makes no sense."" New York's Democratic congressional delegation railed against the decision. ""The decision by a grand jury not to indict in the death of Eric Garner is a miscarriage of justice, its an outrage its a disgrace, its a blow to our democracy, and it should shock the conscience of every single American who cares about justice and fair play,"" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said. Noah Rothman, associate editor at hotair.com, noted the strikingly similar reactions coming from across the political spectrum -- at least for now.  This is one of those moments where left and right could unite. Few seem comfortable with this outcome. Unless recriminations start flying.  Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) December 3, 2014     "
The Washington Post,L,New York police union official blames media over Eric Garner case - The Washington Post," By Erik Wemple December 4 at 7:12 PM  Follow @ErikWemple      Visitors gather at amemorial in Staten Island where Eric Garner died during an arrest in July. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)  MSNBC host Tamron Hall this morning interviewed Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, in an enlightening conversation about the case of 43-year-old Eric Garner, who died in July after a New York police department officer put him in a chokehold. The news yesterday that a Staten Island grand jury didnt indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, has ignited protests and fresh questions about policing in American cities. Mullins told Hall that the current conversation over the case is missing something: Whats not being discussed anywhere across the board is the totality of whats involved in policing, said the police union official. After discussing how the chokehold is banned under NYPD rules and other legal permutations of the case, Mullins said, Unfortunately  this conversation you and I are having is covering a lot of ground related to the law  and a lot of media is not educating everyone as to what the law is, and what the duties of a police officer are.  Not to put any blame on any one individual, but in accordance with law, he was given a lawful order that he didnt comply with. Please, no media-bashing on the Eric Garner case. The only piece of media that matters here is the videotape that shows a white officer (Pantaleo) taking down an unarmed black man (Garner) over some petty offense (selling loosie cigarettes) in what should have been a routine and innocuous interaction.

The Washington Post,L,"Washington state man accused of making threats against Darren Wilson, ex-Ferguson cop who shot Michael Brown - The Washington Post"," By Sarah Larimer December 4 at 4:53 PM  Follow @slarimer      Officer Darren Wilson is pictured in this undated evidence photo from the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. (St. Louis County Prosecutors Office/Handout via Reuters)  About a week after a Missouri grand jury declined to indict a former police officer for the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager, a Washington state man has been arrested for making threats against the 28-year-old. What this indicates is the need for vigilance, attorney Neil Bruntrager told MSNBC in an interview this week, while discussing threats against his client. And were going to maintain vigilance. Bruntrager is an attorney for Darren Wilson, who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August. Browns death sparked unrest in the St. Louis suburb, which continued after the grand jurys decision was announced in late November. Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department on Saturday, a few days before Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar was taken into custody for allegedly making threats against Wilson. He takes them seriously, Bruntrager said of any alleged threats against his client. His concern is not for him, its for his family. In the months after the shooting, few details of Wilsons life were publicly known. Those tracking the case mostly knew him from a blurry photograph taken earlier this year. In recent days, he has participated in a televised interview, however, and more photos of Wilson circulated after grand jury documents were released. According to an eight-page complaintfiled by the Department of Justice, Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, allegedly started posting about Ferguson on Facebook five days after the Brown shooting, and continued to post comments and news stories as the investigation continued. Wanted For Murder of Mike Brown, read a graphic that Abdul-Jabbaar posted in September, which showed Wilson in uniform, the complaint said. Under the graphic, Abdul-Jabbaar wrote: This dude needs his house sprayed. We need to kill this white [expletive] and anything else that has a badge on, Abdul-Jabbaar wrote on Facebook the day that the grand jury reached its decision, states the complaint, which identifies Wilson by his initials throughout. The complaint, filed before theU.S. District Court for Western District of Washington in Seattle,states that in November, Abdul-Jabbaar began posting that he wanted to go to Ferguson. The day the decision was announced, according to the complaint, he wrote: Ready to go kill some cops. Abdul-Jabbaar was arrested without incident at his home in Kirkland, Wash., about 22 minutes outside of Seattle, according to a news releasefrom the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Washington. Although we each have the right to express our views about the decision reached by the state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, we cannot tolerate violence or threats of violence that are intended to intimidate, and ultimately silence debate, acting U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes said in the release. Such threats are crimes, and the individuals who make them must be held to account. "
The Washington Post,L,Hagel says resignation followed series of conversations with president - The Washington Post," By Craig Whitlock December 4 at 3:19 PM  Follow @craigmwhitlock        Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday that he and President Obama had ""no major differences"" that led to his resignation. (AP)   Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday that he decided to resign after he and President Obama agreed that fresh leadershipwas needed at the Pentagon, but he dismissed reports that he was forced out or that there were rifts between him and the WhiteHouse. We both came to the conclusion that I think the country was best served with new leadership, Hagel told reporters in his first extended remarks since he submitted his resignation Nov. 24, after less than two years in the job. But I think youhave to know when to leave, too. Before Hagels comments on Thursday, neither he nor Obama had given a detailed explanation of what prompted his resignation, saying only that it was the culmination of a series of private discussions between the two leaders since October. White House aides have hinted that Obama had lost confidence in Hagels ability to oversee the war against the Islamic State and U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria. Hagel loyalists, meanwhile, have suggested that he had become fed up with White House officials trying to micromanage the Pentagon and that he felt his policy recommendations were being ignored. At Thursdays press conference at the Pentagon, Hagel downplayed reports of discord, saying there were no major differences in any major area. Sure, there are always issues of style, and how you get things done, and are things moving fast enough, but this country, as Ive said, is well served to have a president like President Obama. Still, Hagel steadfastly declined to elaborate on why he and Obama felt that new leadership was necessary, or to reveal details of his conversations with the president. With all the speculation and all the smart people figuring out what was said and what wasnt said, only two people know what was said, he said. Thats the president and me. When Obama nominated Hagel in January 2013, he made clear that he was picking the former Nebraska senator to help wind down the war in Afghanistan, oversee a retrenchment in defense spending and ensure that troops who had served multiple tours in war zones were being taken care of. Although Hagel was a Republican, he and Obama had gotten along well in the Senate, where both had been critical of the Iraq war and pushed for a speedy end to the conflict. As a veteran of the Vietnam War, where he served as an enlisted soldier and was seriously wounded, Hagel spoke with authority about the human toll of combat and how the nations leaders should send troops into battle only as a last resort. Hagel still carries shrapnel in his chest from when he was nearly blown up by the Vietcong. During his time as defense secretary, he has occasionally referred to his time in the Army, but perhaps due to his Midwestern roots, he is usually modest and never dwells on the personal hardships he endured. On Thursday, however, he choked up briefly when he volunteered that it happened to be the 46th anniversary of the day when he returned from Vietnam to the United States, having survived a year of the war. If anybody would have told Sergeant Hagel walking off that plane with my duffel bag where Id be 46 years down the road, that would have been pretty hard for me to believe it, he said, just before he ended the press conference. I mean, the privileges Ive had have just been tremendous."

The Washington Post,L,Jay Gruden could consider adding quarterbacks coach to staff next year - The Washington Post," By Mike Jones December 4 at 4:57 PM  Follow @mikejoneswapo      Quarterbacks Robert Griffin III, left, and Colt McCoy with offensive coordinator Sean McVay on Sunday. (Darron Cummings/Associated Press)  Redskins coach Jay Gruden said that he could consider adding a quarterbacks coach to his staff in the offseason. But the first-year head coach added that he doesnt believe the lack of a coach with that title has hurt his passers this season. Yeah, we are going to revisit everything next year, but that is a position we could revisit, Gruden said when asked if he still felt good about his decision not to have a quarterback coach on his staff. When forming his coaching staff this season, Gruden tabbed Sean McVay as his offensive coordinator, Chris Foerster as offensive line coach, Randy Jordan has running backs coach, Ike Hilliard as wide receivers coach and Wes Phillips as tight ends coach. But Gruden didnt hire a quarterbacks coach. He did, however, also hired an assistant offensive line coach, a special projects and an offensive quality control assistant. Gruden went without aquarterbacks coach, something that only the Redskins and Patriots have opted to do his season, largely because he is very hands-on with the offense, and the quarterbacksoverall. The former quarterback also serves as his own play-caller, although McVay also has a role in the game planning, play selections and coaching of that unit. McVay helps run quarterbacks through position drills, handling the same tasks that Washingtons previous quarterbacks coach, Matt LaFleur, did the past four seasons. And offensive quality control assistant Jake Peetz also helps Gruden and McVay with some of the drilling of the quarterbacks.    Head coach Jay Gruden. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)  McVay and Gruden also share duties in running the quarterback meetings. Quarterback Robert Griffin III struggled this season and has been demoted to second string. Kirk Cousins had some bright spots as the starter with Griffin injured for five games earlier this season, but he played his way out of the job because of his inability to minimize turnovers. Colt McCoy has proven to be the most steady of the three quarterbacks. But Gruden said that he doesnt see those struggles as a byproduct of not having an official quarterback coach. I dont regret it, no, Gruden said about the decision. Because I work closely with the quarterbacks also, and [McVay], and I figured I didnt want to have too many voices preaching. But I think next year, if we have a spot on staff, there is a possibility we could add another guy to that area. But I think we have enough people in-house that are coaching the quarterbacks. Thats not an issue. But if we have a spot next year, then we can address it, like we will at every other position.

The Washington Post,L,Winona State gymnast Brooke Baures dies following accident in food-service elevator - The Washington Post," By Matt Bonesteel December 3  Follow @MattBonesteel   Brooke Baures, a member of the gymnastics team at Winona State University in Minnesota, died Monday following an accident at the restaurant at which she worked. [More details emerge about how the gymnast died] According to a report in the Winona Daily News, Baures was found dead Monday night in a food-service elevator at the WingDam Saloon & Grill in Fountain City, Wis., which is a short drive away from Winona States campus. The Buffalo County Sheriffs Department received a 911 call shortly before 8 p.m. Monday from the WingDam Saloon & Grill, and when first responders arrived they discovered Baures body in the restaurants food service elevator, according to the Fountain City Police Department. Baures was an employee at the restaurant. Baures was pronounced dead at the scene, said Fountain City Police Chief Jason Mork.  Mork said the food elevator, commonly referred to as a dumbwaiter and located off the kitchen, runs between the first and second floors of the restaurant and is generally used to transport bulk food for parties and other events in the space. The opening to the elevator is about three feet by three feet, he said, and was not designed for employees to enter. The lifting mechanism works similar to an electric garage door, he said. Mork told KMSP-TV in Minneapolis that foul play was not believed to be involved. Reached for comment this afternoon, Jason Mork, the only cop in Fountain City (population 859), tells Fox 9, I highly doubt [Baures] was using [the elevator] to move herself. She was likely using it to move food, he adds. Pressed for more specifics, Mork says, I wont get into that I would need to speculate. Mork did say, however, that first responders found Baures trapped inside the elevator she was found by first responders to have passed away. Winona State officials spoke highly of Baures, 21, who was a senior from Chetek, Wis. Brooke had a magnetic personality and a smile that would light up the gym, WSU gymnastics coach Beckie Rolbiecki told the Winona Daily News. She was a sparkplug of a competitor and an ambitious, dedicated teammate. She was one of those athletes who warmed your heart when youd see her walk into the gym. Its so hard for all of us to comprehend."

At about 6:50 p.m., police said that the protesters had left the bridge and were marching west on Constitution Ave., causing street closures as they moved. And later in the night, several hundred protesters marched from D.C. police headquarters on Indiana Avenue NW to the Wilson Building on Pennsylvania Avenue, where former D.C. mayor Marion Barrys remains are lying in repose.

Protest is the language of the unheard. Hewitt said he began attending rallies after Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012. As a young black man, he said he has lost faith in the U.S. justice system. So now art is my weapon, he said, gripping his sign tighter. Washington has been the scene of marches and demonstrations  organized by a fragmented set of activist groups and advertised mainly by social media  almost every day since a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson for shooting Brown, an unarmed black teenager in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

The Washington Post,L,Fixing the conflict of interest at the core of police brutality cases - The Washington Post,"   Dena Wessel stands near police officers during protests in Seattle, Washington, USA, 03 December 2014. Approximately 50 people gathered to support solidarity with other protests around the country after a police officer who killed Eric Garner in New York was not indicted by a grand jury. (Matt Mills Mcknight/EPA)   By Jay Sterling Silver December 4 at 1:44 PM     Jay Sterling Silver is a professor at the St. Thomas University School of Law in Miami.     The lesson to be learned from the refusal of two grand juries, in Missouri and New York, to indict police officers in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner is not that police can get away with murder. Nor is it that the grand jury vending machine can be programmed to return a no bill of indictment in addition to the true bills it normally dispenses. Weve known that all along. The real lesson, at least in terms of criminal procedure, is that there is an inherent conflict of interest in giving local prosecutors so much control over the decision whether to charge police for allegations of bias or excessive use of force  and a compelling need for an independent special prosecutor to handle such cases from start to finish. Thats true in states such as Missouri, where prosecutors can choose to initiate charges either directly or via grand jury, and in states such as New York, where felonies must be charged through the grand jury process.  In the case of Brown, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCullochs clumsy effort to shift responsibility for the decision not to charge Wilson from his office to the grand jury underscored the universal need of local prosecutors to maintain smooth relations with the police  the ones, after all, who arrest and collect evidence against the bad guys those prosecutors are trying to put away. It would have been biting the hand that feeds him for McCulloch to have obtained a homicide charge against Wilson. Instead, McCulloch seems to have opted for what he saw as the lesser of the inevitable evils: public disapprobation for the lack of police accountability in Browns killing. Its the same logic that prosecutors follow whenever they overlook police perjury on the witness stand or, as cops themselves sometimes term it, creative writing in police reports. In a rambling, Orwellian announcement of the grand jurys decision, McCulloch did his best to divert attention from the failure to indict, first blaming the media for disrupting the grand jury process and then seeking to shift responsibility to the community to reduce police killings: I think the people in the community, they need to make their voices heard and they need to address those issues ... so that were never in this position again. He neednt have bothered. From the moment the first car was set on fire after McCulloch announced the grand jurys decision, the media focused primarily on the looting in Ferguson. To promote fairness and confidence in the process, cases of suspected police bias and brutality should automatically be transferred to independent prosecutors whose ability to do their jobs is not dependent upon their standing with the local police. Just as we wouldnt allow prosecutors to decide whether charges will be lodged against a member of their family, we must not continue to permit prosecutors to guide that decision for members of their occupational family. We dont know many details about the grand jury proceedings in Staten Island, but even if a local prosecutor is as fair and objective as the day is long, when it comes to conflicts of interest, appearances count. The mere appearance of a conflict in the charging process diminishes the communitys belief that justice will be done, which in turn shapes attitudes about the legitimacy of law enforcement and the judicial process and, ultimately, influences the nature of police-citizen encounters. Shifting the charging function in such cases to a special prosecutor would have a positive effect on the police side of such encounters, too: Bad actors could no longer operate with impunity in poor and minority communities. Who would choose the special prosecutor? There are many ways it could be done, but given todays hopelessly partisan political climate, perhaps the appointment would best be made by a standing commission of lawyers, judges and state lawmakers  with the lawmakers being drawn in equal numbers from both sides of the aisle. The members of the commission could be appointed by a bipartisan panel of state lawmakers. The specifics can be worked out, but the larger lesson is clear: The conflict of interest at the core of the grand jury process and the pass given to police who kill civilians are an abuse of authority of a kind that, a long time ago, our system of government was established to allay. The question now is: How many communities must ignite before we fix the problem?

The Washington Post,L,U.S. contractor has spent five years in a Cuban prison for distributing Internet equipment - The Washington Post," By Nancy Scola December 4 at 1:41 PM  Follow @nancyscola      Five years to the day after his arrest in Cuba on espionage charges, former U.S. contractor Alan Gross, shown in a file photo with his wife, Judy, is threatening a hunger strike, refusing almost all visitors and predicting he will die in prison if he isnt freed by his 66th birthday in May, relatives and backers said Wednesday. (AP Photo/Courtesy Gross family, File)  The Obama White House has once again called for Cuba to release 65-year-old Alan Gross, a U.S. citizen who is being described in widely-distributed press reports as an ""American government contractor."" But on the fifth anniversary of Gross's imprisonment on a 15-year sentence, it's worth remembering the nature of the crimes against Cuba's ""independence or territorial integritywith which Gross has been charged. Gross, working with the U.S. Agency for International Development, distributed equipment intended to get Jewish Cubans online, including laptops, Wi-Fi routers and satellite phones. Those devices look to Cuban authorities to be the tools of subversion. (They look that way to other governments, too, as the new Freedom House report on the state of online freedoms in 2014 makes plain.) The Internet is a particularly fraught question for the Cuban government, which has long believed that it is part of the country's technological sovereignty to limit how Cubans go online. On Wednesday, the White House said in a statement: Five years ago today Alan Gross was arrested for his efforts to help ordinary Cuban citizens have greater access to information through the Internet. The Administration remains focused on securing Alan's freedom from a Cuban prison, and returning him safely to his wife and children, where he belongs. We remain deeply concerned for Alan's health, and reiterate our call for his release. The Cuban Government's release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba. Gross, in should be noted, was in Cuba as part of a controversial pro-democracy program, and he represented himself not as a U.S. government contractor but as being in Cuba to do philanthropic work. But any discussion of Gross's imprisonment is incomplete without a recognition that he wasn't in Cuba distributing guns or tank parts. He was passing outequipmentso that people could getonline, which is something that the Cuban government considers quite dangerous enough."

When are reverse mortgages due? What triggers early withdrawal penalties? What exactly is covered by Medicare again?
Retirement planning is hard, and most people struggleto understand the fundamentals,according to a new report by the American College of Financial Services, a nonprofit that educates financial advisers. Only 20 percent of people in or near retirement who were surveyed by the group passed a quiz about the basics of retirement planning.
The group quizzed more than 1,000 people, ages 60 to 75, who had at least $100,000 in assets. The goalwas to get a sense of how informedpeople areas theyapproach retirement, saysDave Littell, a director at The American College. In some ways we expected people wouldnt do that great on the test, Littell says. We were surprised at just how bad they did.
People were most stumped by questions about thestrategies that could help their money last longer inretirement. For instance,more people said they would get thebiggest boost totheir retirement income bysaving more when they were close to retirement, but in reality pushing back retirement bya few years or delaying Social Security would have a bigger impact, Littell says. (Savings set aside at that stagedont have as much time to benefit from investment growth,he says.)
Indeed, people often misunderstand the rules about drawing down their assets in retirement, saysGary Koenig, vice president of financial security for the AARP Public Policy Institute. People forget that they need to start taking required minimum distributions from their individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s after age70 1/2, says Koenig, who was not involved in the study. Othersdont know that taking Social Security benefits at 62 leads to a permanent reduction in benefits, assuming incorrectly that they would start receiving full benefits once they reach full retirement age, he says.
Some of the 38 questions asked in the quiz were far from elementary, hitting on complicated retirement products like annuities. Some were more focused on investing topics like interest rate risk and mutual fund costs. (Do you know what a PE ratio is? Orwhat is the average lifetime payout for a 65-year-old male getting an immediate income annuity?) Some of the terminology may have tripped people up, Littell says. Jargon is a challenge, he says, adding that it can be tough to avoid such complicated terms.
But the confusion also highlighted another risk  people may be over confident about their retirement security. Whilemost people struggled to answer the questions on retirement strategy, more than half, or 55 percent, said they felt they were prepared to meet their income needs in retirement. Ninety-one percent said they were moderately confident they would have a secure retirement.
The quiz also highlighted one thing that people often get wrong that could increasetheir chances of running out of money in retirement  how long they are likely to live. Most people underestimate their longevity, putting them at risk of drawing down their savings too soon, collecting Social Security benefits too early and taking a lump-sum payment from a pension plan when they might be better off with an annuity, Koenig says.
What do you think, are you smart enough to retire? Test your luck withthis excerpt of the quiz:

The Washington Post,L,"What percentage of politicians support same-sex marriage, by state - The Washington Post"," By Hunter Schwarz December 4 at 5:33 PM  Follow @hunterschwarz    About 45 percent of all governors and members of Congress across the country support same-sex marriage,and in all but 10 states there is at least one member of Congress or the governor who does. The percentage of politicians who support marriage for same-sex couples is slightly lower than the percentage of Americans who do. A SeptemberPew poll found that 49 percent of respondents were in favor of gay men and lesbians being allowed to legally marry, while 41 percent were opposed and 10 percent didnt know. Using information from the Human Rights Campaign and governors public statements, the percentage of elected officials who support marriage for same-sex couples was mapped out. Vacant seats were not included in states total, and elected officials whose views on marriage were not clear were not counted as being supportive. In Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont, 100 percent of governors and members of Congress support marriage for same-sex couples. In Maryland, there is more than 90 percent support, and in Maine, New Hampshire and New York, there is at least 80 percent support."
The Washington Post,L,The surprising origins of the #CrimingWhileWhite movement - The Washington Post," By Drew Harwell and Danielle Paquette December 4 at 8:13 PM  Follow @drewharwell Follow @dpaqreport    As outrage spread nationally over a grand jurys decision not to indict a white New York police officer in the death of black man, a professional writer for Jimmy Fallon sent a half-joking tweet Wednesday ridiculing white privilege under the hashtag #CrimingWhileWhite. It exploded, and soon white people were confessing to crimes they got away with at a rate of 600 tweets a minute: A white drunken driver given only a speeding ticket. A man, after shoving a police officer, told to go home and sleep it off. By Thursday morning, the online campaign that some saw as a show of solidarity had become another source of division. Many African Americans on Twitter began to see it as a belittling, self-serving failure to grasp the daily discriminations confronting blacks. I know it was well-intentioned, said Jamilah Lemieux, a senior digital editor at Ebony magazine, who launched a response hashtag, #AliveWhileBlack. For white people to say, Hey, these are all the things Ive gotten away with it starts feeling more hurtful than productive. As social flashpoints expand from the streets to online, #CrimingWhileWhite became the latest sign of how racial tensions can boil over in a digital age. The result was at turns organic, chaotic and raw  a flurry of expression that captured the best and worst of how Americans talk about race. The tweets helped pull a whispered universe of racial privilege onto a national, share-able stage, and #CrimingWhileWhite became Twitters most shared topic in the United States and a trending topic across the world. But some questioned whether it had undermined its own message by pushing moments of privilege into performance art. It can be the start to something great if there are extensive conversations beyond the 140 characters, if theres real action and work beyond just what we post on our Twitter or Facebook status updates, said Stephany Rose, an assistant professor of womens and ethnic studies at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. It can be useful. But it just cannot remain as this performance  this distraction from what people of color need right now when it comes to justice in their community. At best, the tweets were untold and deeply personal, stemming from a broad section of Americans who might not otherwise take to the streets in protest. Paired with #AliveWhileBlack, the vignettes provided a baffling look at racial inequality in the wake of the recent deaths of Eric Garner, 43, and two other black males, 18-year-old Michael Brown and 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Acknowledging it first of all goes a real close way to understanding. That is tangible, that is progress, said Christopher Parker, an associate professor of social justice and political science at the University of Washington. It has that domino effect: The more involved you feel with something, the more passionate you feel with it, the more you identify with it. But at worst, some said, the tweets amounted to a bragging board, another point of isolation over which blacks and whites stood irrevocably apart. Like many protests, the venue contributed to the chaos: on Twitter, the boundless flurry of 140-character sentiment appeared detached from conversation and context-free. Its always this problem with the evolving nature of online media, the way social movements have used it, evolving their own form of protest, said Cliff Lampe, an associate professor of information at the University of Michigan. Raising awareness, does that do any good? Does that create any meaningful change? It would not be the first online social movement criticized as shallow clicktivism, with participants more concerned about affiliation with a popular cause than meaningful protest. A similar movement, #FirstWorldProblems  a tongue-in-cheek meme of petty issues facing only the healthy and well-off  was later ridiculed for encouraging the kind of whining it was made to lament. Jason Ross, the Tonight Show writer and former Daily Show writer, launched the #CrimingWhileWhite hashtag Wednesday, tweeting, Busted 4 larceny at 11. At 17, cited for booze + caught w gun @ school. No one called me a thug. Cant recommend being white highly enough. He encouraged other white people to share their stories of being under-punished. When reached, Ross said he sent the tweet from his personal account and was not acting as a representative of the Tonight Show. He declined to comment further. Though hard to verify, the ensuing tweets appeared in many cases to be genuine attempts to share anger over how differently blacks and whites are treated in modern life. Mary Pierce, 39, a special education lawyer in Boston, said she was pushed by guilt to type her story Wednesday on her iPhone as she scrolled through the stories from both hashtags: When I was 21 I was pulled over drunk and crying from a break up. Wasnt arrested. #CrimingWhileWhite. Pierce said she probably reeked like beer that day as she sped through Phoenix, mascara smeared. The officer didnt even give me a sobriety test, she said. He almost looked apologetic. Im not trying to cause any more pain or brag with this story  just acknowledge theres privilege. That its wrong. But the sensitive racial dimensions of #CrimingWhileWhite, some said, made it all the more painful to accept. Elon James White, a blogger, radio host and founder of This Week in Blackness, said the tweets showcased another America with which he could never play a part. It was a hard pill to swallow, reading those. You people were talking about drugs, causing accidents and getting off scot-free, White said. Id be arrested just for thinking about it. White shared his own story of #AliveWhileBlack: Having forgot his wallet at work, he jumped a New York subway turnstile, only to find himself immediately arrested, jailed overnight and interrogated over other crimes. Such tales of disparity arelargely what led Lemieux, the Ebony editor magazine, to launch #AliveWhileBlack from her home in Brooklyn. Lemieux thought of her father, a police officer, who carefully instructed our family and friends in how to deal with police officers.  Unfortunately, there are skills you need to survive the police. Even agreeing on the singular message from hundreds of thousands of disparate stories became a sticking point. Ethan Zuckerman, the director of the Center for Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he supported the hashtag as a movement for racial justice but was worried by the implicit problem of whites feeling comfortable posting about past crimes. The absurdity of persistent racism in America means that white Americans rarely think about privilege, Zuckerman said, and black Americans are forced to think about vulnerability and targeting all the time. But Zuckerman said, in a conversation, Sherrilyn Ifill, a director of the NAACPs Legal Defense and Education Fund, told him that she saw the #CrimingWhileWhite hashtag as an encouraging sign that whites were both acknowledging the privilege and recognizing its implications. She told me she was happily retweeting, Zuckerman said."
The Washington Post,L,I refuse to post a single picture of my baby on Facebook - The Washington Post,"  By Emily Kaye Lazzaro December 4 at 12:17 PM Follow EmilyKayeLa  Emily Kaye Lazzaro is a writer, actor, and playwright based in Somerville, Massachusetts.      iStock  In my Facebook newsfeed, its common for brand-new parents to post pictures of their babies as a modern-day birth announcement. I love these posts. I love getting updates on how the baby and mother are doing, and I love cute pictures because I am a human being with a beating heart in my chest. But bad news for my Facebook friends: I wont be posting pictures of my baby on Facebook. There are pros and cons to this policy. Pro: The smugness of privacy It always felt to me that people who really value their privacy are very important and also have a huge amount of self-control. Like the really cool celebrities. Or people who dont even have Facebook. Oh man, I wish I could be one of those people. Instead, I periodically pretend like I dont have Facebook, feel like a million bucks for a week, then cave like that scene in Flight and binge on my newsfeed for a few hours. I am not important, and I constantly overshare. I have almost posted baby pictures a few times, but the thing that stopped me, more than my husbands insistence and my own fear of his image being misappropriated, is the delicious smugness I feel. I think Buster said it best:  She gets off on being withholding. Con: Whats the use of feeling smug if people dont even know how cute he is?  Beyonc probably feels great about people not seeing pictures of Blue Ivy because everybody knows about Blue Ivy. If nobody knows about my baby, theres no way for them to be impressed that I havent posted pictures of him. This reminds me of when I started college. I sent a lot of e-mails to my close high school friends, detailing all the new friends I was making and experiences I was having. I was obsessive about communicating the minutiae of my college experience because I felt like if my old friends didnt know about it, it didnt happen. Now this is true on a much larger scale. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to Instagram it, did it really happen? I also feel this way about sunsets and times when my dog and cat snuggle and things I bake. Of course sunsets and animal snuggles and baked goods exist, but all of those things, like this time in my babys life, are ephemeral. Isnt this why weve been photographing things since the camera was invented? To hold on to moments even as they slip through our fingers? Thats a bit of a reach. Maybe its just that I want to share the nice moments with my network because there are so many not nice moments, especially in parenthood. Or maybe its because Im super self-involved and my baby is just an extension of myself. Who knows! Pro: Nobody from the Internet will appropriate pictures of my precious infant to make me look like an idiot. This is a real and personal issue for me, as I made the grievous error of being a blogger and writing about pregnancy and money. Turns out, many people dont like what I have to say. And some have decided to illustrate their distaste by stealing pictures of me and writing not so nice things. In fact, a tabloid found a piece Id written and decided to write something about me. To illustrate it, they used Facebook pictures of me, my husband, and my dog (taken from my husbands account). I was wearing a silly hat in one of them. In another, Im grimacing and petting my dogs belly. Using images of me and my husband is bad enough, but my beagle? That is especially low. She already has emotional problems, she doesnt need this on top of it. Now, granted, my husbands Facebook privacy settings were pretty weak, and weve remedied that since, but the whole situation spooked me good. So, not posting pictures of my baby on Facebook means no Internet strangers can use his image against me. This is the world we live in. Con: It is less easy for people to see how cute my baby is. He is very cute! But nobody knows. Refusing to post pictures of him on the Internet means I am forgoing the dozens of likes and comments and accompanying surges of validation and satisfaction that I have come to expect with major life moments. Its not even that my close friends cant see him, I still allow myself to text pictures to close friends and family. Its the peripheral acquaintances, the people I went to high school with, guys I had crushes on in college. They are my real concern. They will never see how cute my baby is, and thus will never know how great Im doing and how happy I am. Can I live with that? This, of course, touches on the issue of cultivating our online personas, only revealing the good and hiding the everyday struggles. But whatever, when other people post smiley baby pictures it makes me want to post them too. Forget about the fact that I am still 35 pounds overweight, thats not part of my image. My personal brand does not include the revelation I had last night that the biggest challenge of new parenthood is not murdering your own baby when he wont stop crying. Facebook is for happy times. Cute outfits and first smiles and those chubby arms with the rubber-band wrists. If I dont post cute pictures of my baby on Facebook, that means I have to rely on myself to be impressive. I have to look good and accomplish things in my career and that is hard. At the very least, I have to make jokes in my status updates, without accompanying photographs. As if I dont have enough going on. Pro: There are other ways The night my son was born, my husband, in a terrified, sleep-deprived haze, spent hours looking for an app we could use to share baby pictures with family and friends. We use 23snaps; it doesnt let other users copy your pictures or use them on other platforms. And it almost feels like we have freed ourselves from the shackles of Facebook, at least a tiny bit. And it feels less like we are forcing baby pictures down peoples throats and more like were sharing with people who actually give a crap, which is nice. Look, Im certainly not saying this is how every new parent should behave. Im not even sure how long Ill last. If it makes you happy, post pictures of your kids wherever you damn well please. This is America. But I will say one thing. Two days ago, we took our seven-week-old son to the beach for the first time. We let our dog off her leash and my husband carried the baby snug on his chest. We smelled the ocean and felt the sand under our shoes and we forgot to take pictures, which initially sent me into a small panic. My babys first time at the beach and there is no record of it! Was it reckless of me to not have documented this fleeting bliss? But maybe part of being a parent and the growing up that comes with that will be the ability to just enjoy a moment of peace and happiness with my family, even if the Internet doesnt know about it.

The Washington Post,L,Weve reached a tipping point when Charles Krauthammer is more outspoken on police abuses than Barack Obama - The Washington Post," By Emily Badger December 4 at 10:51 AM  Follow @emilymbadger      Protestors shout at Times Square after it was announced that the New York City police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner is not being indicted, Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2014, in New York. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)  It's a common condolence for politicians to urge angry communities to ""have their voices heard"" in response to signs of systemic injustice. Barack Obama has used the phrase since Ferguson. So has Eric Holder, and even St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch, the night he announced that a grand jury would not indict the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown. The idea, of course, is that a voice is a potent tool for creating change, particularly for people who possess little other power. But the more accurate reality is that change starts to feel imminent not when the likely voices grow louder, but when the unlikely ones start to speak up. This is why it's a big deal  if an awkward commentary on whose words matter most  that conservatives seem appalled, too, by Wednesday's news that a New York Police Department officer won't be indicted in the death of Eric Garner. Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said this on MSNBC in response to the latest grand jury announcement: ""They tell us, at least, a prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich. Well clearly a black man's life is not worth a ham sandwich when you put these stories together.""  Here is Senator Rand Paul, a potential Republican presidential candidate, saying that it's hard to watch the video of Garner's death and ""not be horrified by it"":  And here is conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, on Fox News, calling the latest grand jury decision ""totally incomprehensible"":  Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com For reasons that Aaron Blake points out over at The Fix, the politics around Eric Garner's death have been different from those around Michael Brown's. In the New York case, caught on tape, there are fewer details to dispute, leaving bare some painful points of consensus: An unarmed black man died after an NYPD officer apparently wrapped an arm around his neck, deploying a tactic banned by his department. The man's alleged crime was selling illegal cigarettes. He repeatedly cried that he couldn't breathe as he was dying. That this story has drawn bipartisan condemnation is what makes it feel like a tipping point. The fact that Michael Steele has been more blunt than Barack Obama thus far makes it seem as if liberals and conservatives are finally watching the same event, staring down the same problem, not opposing versions of it. This isn't to say that the voices of protesters aren't meaningful, too. But protest is largely the expression of people who knew that police bias and excessive force were problems before Michael Brown and Eric Garner died. When partisans who haven't said much about these issues before start to speak up, too, that's a sign that a larger swathe of America may be waking up to that reality, too."
The Washington Post,L,The glaring problem with #CrimingWhileWhite - The Washington Post," By Caitlin Dewey December 4 at 2:37 PM  Follow @caitlindewey      (Twitter)  #CrimingWhileWhite, the explosive Twitter hashtag that trended worldwide Thursday morning and racked up more than 300,000 tweets since Wednesday night, is a well-intentioned attempt to expose the different ways whites and people of color are treated by police. It is also an enduring testament to an unavoidable fact: White people can make absolutely anything about them. The ostensible purpose of the hashtag, per its creator, Tonight Show writer Jason Ross, is to document racial injustice in policing  from the perspective of white people. As such, the hashtag consists mostly of Twitter usersconfessing to minor crimes for which they were never charged. Its a head-shaking list, particularly following the deaths of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Here are people shoplifting, driving drunk, swearing at police  and always getting away with it, because they look nice. I shoplifted when I was 14 and they let me go because my parents came down and we looked like a nice family. #crimingwhilewhite Joel Watson (@hijinksensue) December 4, 2014  Got pulled over while driving 115MPH, only got a $80 tickt instead of a felony 4 being cooperative n wearing my seatbelt #CrimingWhileWhite eli skipp (@skipp) December 4, 2014  At 13 I stole a car with my friends & drove it 2wks before we got busted. Only one charged was black. #CrimingWhileWhite Cecily Kellogg (@Cecilyk) December 4, 2014  Its really important to note these inequities, of course. Its critical that we record and analyze and criticize white privilege, that oft-confounding, abstract concept that describes the pack of unearned advantages you get in life, just by virtue of your race. But theres profound privilege built into even #CrimingWhileWhite, which is supposedly such a force against it. Consider how fortunate and secure you must be, to feel entitled to talk about yourself in the face of someone elses overwhelming pain and grief. To be comfortable flinging around light-hearted anecdotes about the police, because those interactions dont represent any kind of ongoing threat to you or your family. To type 100 characters and stamp them with a trendy hashtag, unafraid of any blowback  because, as per usual, you rule the narrative; yours is the dominant voice. To top it all off, #CrimingWhileWhite has earned fawning, uncritical write-ups on virtually every news site out there, a scale and tone of coverage we rarely see for #BlackLivesMatter or #DyingWhileBlack or any other non-white social media narrative on race. #CrimingWhileWhite is the only thing you need to read to understand white privilege, Think Progress proclaimed. But #CrimingWhileWhite doesnt just document white privilege  it is white privilege, manifest. Dont get me wrong: Im sure these tweeters truly do mean well. Im sure they are genuinely outraged by the polices treatment of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and other black men killed by white police under polarizing circumstances. But there are subtle shades of difference between being outraged by something  a sort of luxurious, twice-removed feeling  and actually living that something, yourself. That doesnt mean that you, as a white person, are not allowed to discuss what just happened in New York and Ferguson, and it doesnt mean youre not allowed to talk about issues of race in this country. It just means that  maybe this once! dont talk about yourself. Several hours after #CrimingWhileWhite began to trend, the writer Jamilah Lemieux started a competing hashtag: Its called #AliveWhileBlack, and its meant to document white privilege, in the justice system and elsewhere, from theperspective of people of color. As of this writing, its earned only a sixth of the tweets that #CrimingWhileWhite did. I was stopped 29 times by cops in E. Europe during my 18 months as a Fulbright Scholar.

The Washington Post,L,Huge shakeup at The New Republic: What does this vanity publisher want? - The Washington Post," By Erik Wemple December 4 at 6:46 PM  Follow @ErikWemple      Sean Eldridge, president, Hudson River Ventures, and Chris Hughes, editor in chief and publisher of The New Republic and a founder of Facebook, attend the Paris Review Spring Revel in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, April 3, 2012. The benefit celebrated the literary magazines 200th issue. (Amanda Gordon/Bloomberg)  There was a telling moment at the New Republics centennial celebration last month in the stately Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium. NewCEO Guy Vidra, recently appointed by owner (and Facebook co-founder) Chris Hughes, took the podium to discuss the magazines challenges and opportunities in a digital age, just as any modern-day media mogul would do. When he referenced the name of The New Republics top editor, however, he mispronounced it: Frank FOY-er, he said. Thats indicative of his familiarity and interest in Franks impact on the magazine, on the website, says a TNR editorial staffer familiar with the disconnect between the magazines new leadership and Foer himself, who has served as editor since 2012, his second stint in the position. This afternoon, a shower of memos sprung from New Republic e-mail accounts, announcing a significant shakeup, as first reported by Politicos Dylan Byers: Foer was out as editor-in-chief, to be replaced by Gabriel Snyder of Bloomberg Media, and formerly editor of Atlantic Wire and Gawker. In his memo, Vidra wrote of his new top editor, He is committed  as am I  to The New Republics mission of impact, influence and persuasion, but understands that fulfilling that mission in todays media landscape requires new forms, reads the memo. He truly reflects the straddle generation of journalists and editors who remain deeply rooted in the qualities of traditional journalism  having worked with brands such as the New York Observer and The Atlantic  but also understands what it takes to create content that will travel across all platforms. We believe he is the right person to help us to maintain the core DNA of The New Republic, while propelling us forward to the 21st century. In that same missive, Vidra announced that the frequency of the New Republics print edition would drop from 20 to 10 issues a year. In conjunction with the print reduction, Vidra promises something chilling: [W]e will also be making some changes to staff structure. This is not a decision we make lightly, but we believe this restructuring is critical to the long-term success of the company. Are layoffs coming? Nobodyknows. According to oneinternal source, there was chatter in the office of a mass departure, in large part because the staff was loyal to Foer. Everyone loves Frank, says the internal source. Staffers saythat Foer found out about his ouster not fromHughes and Vidra but rather through the grapevine, as word of Snyders hiring seeped into his socio-professional network. More big news in the memo: The New Republics New York arm is moving to a newly re-designed, expanded office in New Yorks Union Square. New York was the original home of The New Republic, and were thrilled to further expand our presence here. (The D.C. office will remain put). And in case you havent heard, famed literary editor Leon Wieseltier is out in the purge. A newish, tech-oriented New Republic in a sleek New York office wont surprise staffers whove interacted with Vidra, a former general manager of Yahoo News and former head of business development at The Washington Post, since his announcement as the New Republics CEO in September. According to an informed source, Vidra introduced himself to the staff in a meeting where he spoke grandly of the digital imperatives of the magazine. What was absent from the session was any nod to the work of Foer. There was no deference to Frank, says a source. Vidras insertion comes after some strategic shifting at the New Republic. In 2012, multimillionaire Hughes bought a majority stake in the magazine and determinedly set out to pound Washington with its relevance. He doubled the editorial staff of 15; he hired Foer; he opened a New York office; and he talked big: I want everyone from Michael Bloomberg to Zadie Smith to Sheryl Sandberg to read The New Republic, he told the New York Times. Though Hughes had come from the world of technology, his magazines initial strategy came from the world of media. The staff build-out created separate and unequal fiefdoms of youngsters who toiled away primarily on NewRepublic.com and more experienced writers who did good, big piecesfor the print edition (and which also did well on NewRepublic.com). The websters didnt stick around: Lydia DePillis left the New Republic for the Washington Posts Wonkblog; Noreen Malone left for New York Magazine; Molly Redden left for Mother Jones; Marc Tracy eventually left for the New York Times. According to three sources, the Hughes regime realized in mid-2013 that it couldnt sustain a great print magazine and a great web project at the same time. Its efforts to boost print subscriptions werent producing the dividends it needed, nor was it pulling in enough print advertising. So it started to pivot toward a more web-trafficky approach. For this tack, it grabbed the prolific Brian Beutler from Salon.com as well as Danny Vinik and Rebecca Leber, from ThinkProgress. As part of the turn towards webbiness, the New Republic started imitating otherslast June, launching QED, a boutique-y version of Wonkblog-Vox.com, FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot  you know, smart people explaining stuff with a bit of opinion thrown in. The push toward a digital emphasis hit a new level with Vidras hiring. In a recent New York Times interview, Vidra touted a focus on storytelling approaches that travel well on the Internet. Seeking a bit more explanation on that topic, the Erik Wemple Blog last month received this explanation from Vidra: Our aim is to find forms of storytelling that resonate with online audiences, not just to drive traffic, but to have readers engage deeply with The New Republic. Our long form journalism is one form of storytelling that readers consistently flock to. Pieces that challenge, provoke, and elevate the discourse perform extremely well online. For example, William Deresiewiczs cover story on the Ivy League (our most read story of all time), Noam Scheibers cover story on Valerie Jarrett, and Franklin Foers cover story on Amazon are some of our most read articles this past month. A very relevant example of extending our storytelling into new formats that travel well online is our 100 Thinkers project. We brought 100 Thinkers to life on the web earlier this week after having our developers, designers and writers work collaboratively from ideation to execution. The results have been very positive with readers engaging deeply, spending a significant amount of time navigating through the microsite and sharing it broadly on Facebook and Twitter. While not a 5,000 word essay, it challenges our readers assumptions about the world and well continue to experiment with storytelling forms like this. Those are telling words, in hindsight. For one, Vidra cites as aspirational the work of a guy whose firing he just effected (Foers Amazon piece, that is). And for another, he lauds Scheibers excellent piece on Jarrett, titled The Obama Whisperer: No one has understood Valerie Jarretts role, until now. Had he cared to include other examples of that New Republic genre, he might have cited Alec MacGilliss stunning September 2013 investigation of Bill Clinton aide Doug Band; MacGilliss in-depth profile of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Jonathan Cohns investigation into the barely regulated, unsafe business of looking after our children; and a whole lot of Julia Ioffe reporting on Russia. Those, and others like them, are the hallmarks of Foers second go-round at the New Republic. At the centennial gala, Foer and others, including Wieseltier, waxed grandiose about the New Republics history as a journal of ideas, of great debates, of concepts and blah blah blah. The celebration, the costs of which the New Republic wouldnt divulge, offered as party gifts a large tome of great New Republic essays going back to its beginnings. The Erik Wemple Blog spent Thanksgiving break with the book and enjoyed the thinking of Walter Lippmann, Margaret Talbot, Wieseltier and many others. Indeed, the featured works align with the notion of an idea-centric New Republic. Yet Foer in recent years has tacked away from pure thinkiness with his idea-investigative pieces  pieces that have clothed the publication in recent glory. The Jarrett piece, for instance, hopped all around social media, leaving the Erik Wemple Blog absolutely no choice but to open it up. Similar surges of interest around other deeply reported stuff had to delight Hughes. Wasnt this precisely the stuff that a status-conscious vanity publisher wanted to generate? Yes, says one staffer: He was totally into it. He was basking in the prestige he was getting from it. This is why it seemed like things were going to be fine. Now theres concern that under this staff restructuring and continuing web pivot, such stories wont be coming out too often: Its mystifying that hes doing something thats about to make him look deeply unserious, says the staffer. Perhaps Vidra and Snyder can thread straddling operation. Well have to wait and see. As they go about their business, theyll be doing it without the guidance of Wieseltier, who by his own admission isnt the most webby guy: Leon says he doesnt do Twitter but he loves you all.  Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe) December 4, 2014  Whether you call him the magazines conscience, its guiding light, its curmudgeon or much, much worse, one thing is clear: Wieseltier has been a constant at the New Republic, having served as literary editor since 1983. Upon Hughess accession as publisher, Wieseltier struck a tone of conciliation, sounding very hopeful of holding on to his longtime perch: He has no interest in blogging, which, I have to say, sounded like Mozart to me, said Wieseltier of Hughes to the New Yorker back in 2012. In acquiring a new owner, the thing you worry about, its the continuities and the discontinuitieswhat will be continuous and what will be discontinuous. Its pretty clear that the continuities here are going to be the essential ones. Im really confident that that includes our politics. Those continuities held on Wieseltier on staff for a couple of years. Despite all the chatter about web vs. print and thinky vs. investigative, his departure isthe big story here. After all, regular old editors commonly get tossed from their New Republic offices, while Wieseltier kept on writing, thinking, lecturing.And then a tech upstart booted a Washington institution."
The Washington Post,L,Black males and the cops who kill them - The Washington Post," By Jonathan Capehart December 4 at 6:02 PM  Follow @capehartj      Demonstrators walk together during a protest Dec. 3, 2014 in New York. Protests began after a Grand Jury decided to not indict officer Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner. (Yana Paskova/Getty Images)  Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Michael Brown have something in common: All were unarmed African American males killed by police officers. Now, we are learning that the cops who killed them have something in common. Either they or the department they worked for had serious problems. That these men were still given a gun and badge and were in a position to take the life of a black male without being held accountable is whats rubbing the nerves raw of African Americans, all Americans. Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner with a chokehold caught on video last July. The death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner. The grand jury opted not to indict him. The Daily News and the Staten Island Advance have reported on two lawsuits involving Pantaleo and racially motivated conduct. A 2012 suit involved two black men who alleged their testicles were tapped during an out-in-the-open strip search. According to the Daily News, the allegations were deemed unsubstantiated  it could not be proven or disproven. Each accuser got $15,000 when the case was settled out of court. The charges against them were dropped. Another suit against Pantaleo is still pending. According to a July 20 story in The Advance, Rylawn Walker accuses Pantaleo of arresting him on Feb. 16, 2012 even though he was committing no crime at that time and was not acting in a suspicious manner.    Undated photo of Tamir Rice provided by his familys attorney. (Courtesy of Richardson & Kucharski Co. L.P.A./AP)  Timothy A. Loehmann is the Cleveland police officer who killed Rice in a Cleveland park on Nov. 22. The video shows that the police cruiser had barely stopped and Loehmann was barely out of the car before he shot Tamir dead. Now comes word that Loehmann resigned from his last police job because his supervisor recommended he dismissed because, I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct the deficiencies. Issueswith a girlfriend were part of the problem. According to NBC News, the deputy chief cited a report from a firearms instructor who said Loehmann showed up for training distracted, weepy and unable to communicate clear thoughts, as a result of which his handgun performance was dismal. Oh, the irony. And then there is Darren Wilson, the unindicted killer of Brown. As The Post reported last August, in his job before joining the Ferguson, Mo., police force, Wilson kept a clean record without any disciplinary action. But that force in Jennings, Mo., was so bad the city council disbanded it in 2011. Jennings is 89 percent African American. A city council member told The Post that there were one or two black members on the force of 45 employees. Wilson was among the officers let go. What [Wilson] found in Jenningswas a mainly white department mired in controversy and notorious for its fraught relationship with residents, especially the African American majority, The Post story notes. It was not an ideal place to learn. Perhaps this informed the guilt-by-association mindset he revealed at the grand jury looking into his killing of Brown. Its really bad when Im overseas and more worried about your safety, a white American friend who is working in the Middle East wrote in an instant message this morning. Then, in one line, he articulated what African Americans have known for a long time: Cops have more influence over the administration of your constitutional rights than any judge or elected official [not to mention] your life. The only bright side to the horror of the past seven days is that more and more white people seethat black lives matter. Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj"
The Washington Post,L,"After Brown and Garner, limiting the downside of police body cameras - The Washington Post"," By Stephen Stromberg December 4 at 8:04 PM Follow @strombergsteve      A New York City police officer wears abody camera during a news conference abouta pilot program. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)  Its inevitable that more police officers will be wearing body cameras in the coming years. The question should be, under what standards? After a grand jury declined to indict New York City policeofficer Daniel Pantaleo for putting Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold, despite shockingfootage of the incident, some have questioned whether more video evidence will matter much. Meanwhile, the Atlantics Uri Friedman pushed back Wednesday against the strong post-Ferguson movement to deploy officer body cameras,noting that experts still lack definitive proof that they live up to their hype as policing tools. They make logical sense, body camera expert Barak Ariel told Friedman  but researchers are still collecting evidence. Thats not to say, though, that there isnt any. There are several strong indications that body cameras can improve a range of law enforcement activities, including confrontations that have the potential to turn violent. One sign is the success of police dashboard cameras, which have increased officer safety and accountability and reduced agency liability, a recent Justice Department analysis reported. Another is psychological research that shows people tend to be more responsible when they are being recorded. Yet another is on-the-ground experience from early-adopting police departments in the United StatesandBritain. The Justice report warns that its not yet clear why body cameras seem to help. The decline in complaints and use of force may be tied to improved citizen behavior, improved police officer behavior, or a combination of the two. It may also be due to changes in citizen complaint reporting patterns (rather than a civilizing effect), as there is evidence that citizens are less likely to file frivolous complaints against officers wearing cameras. Butany of these causal explanations would be positive. These considerations and logical sense seem to be enough for policymakers. President Obama has asked Congress for $263 million in federal funds to help equip police departments. That would accelerate a transition that has already begun. If the question of whether the country will put body cameras on more officers already seems to be answered, however, there are still plenty more questions that police departments will have to address from there. For example: Where will they store their recorded video? Will officers be trained well enough to know when its appropriate to record and when its not  and reliably act on that knowledge? Will public disclosure practices be geared toward effective transparency, witness protection and other worthy goals, or toward shielding officers? And how will police departments ensure that stored, unreleased video  on the cloud, say  is protected from unauthorized access? Homeland security consultant Paul Rosenzweig put it to me this way: If youre wondering whether storing sensitive police images in the cloud is a potential privacy hazard, ask Jennifer Lawrence. Officers a lot of times are seeing people on the worst day of their lives, an Albuquerque police sergeant told Justice Department analysts, and were capturing that on video thats now a public record. Police departments will have to figure out how various privacy and evidence laws apply to body camera footage. They will also have to fill in gaps. The Body Worn Video Steering Group, an international association of police organizations using body cameras, has developed a policy template that departments can adapt for themselves. Better yet, the Justice Department should produce its own model standards. And before the federal government starts distributing hundreds of millions of dollars, Congress should think about requiring all police departments that get money to take some basic care."
The Washington Post,L,Dangerous Super Typhoon Hagupit on collision course with Philippines - The Washington Post," By Angela Fritz December 4 at 11:31 AM  Follow @angelafritz      Infrared satellite image of Super Typhoon Hagupit on Thursday morning. Hagupit is expected to make landfall somewhere in the Philippines between Saturday and Sunday, though the potential track remains uncertain. (NOAA/NASA and RAMMB/CIRA)  Super Typhoon Hagupit, which exploded in intensity on Wednesday evening, is on a collision course with the Philippines. The only question that remains is where exactly the dangerous storm will make landfall. In the six hours between 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Typhoon Hagupits winds ballooned from 115 mph to 150 mph, pushing the storm into super typhoon status. It didnt stop there, continuing to intensify into a 180 mph storm overnight. On Wednesday morning, Super Typhoon Haguput was still boasting sustained winds of 175 mph, with gusts over 200 mph.    Super Typhoon Hagupits eye on Wednesday night. (NOAA/NASA and RAMMB/CIRA)  Hagupit has likely peaked atits maximum intensity, though will remainan extremelydangerous storm as it approaches the Philippines over the next couple of days. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center forecasts Hagupit to be the equivalent of a category 4 hurricane as it roars ashore between Saturday and Sunday. While the track forecasts have come into somewhat better agreement since Wednesday, there is still a large amount of uncertainty about exactly where the center of the typhoon, containingthe most destructive winds, will come ashore.    Track forecasts on Thursday morning from the three agencies forecasting Typhoon Hagupit. (CNN/Brandon Miller)  The Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which produces forecasts for the U.S. Navy,continues to forecast a track farther north than the other two agencies. The JTWC suggests Hagupit will brushover Northern Samar before making another landfall in the Bicol Region. The forecasts from the other two agencies covering the storm are much more dire for the region of the Philippines that is still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. Both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Philippines weather service are forecasting a trackthat brings the typhoon ashore closer to the still-devastated city of Tacloban. The threat of Hagupit comes just one year after deadly Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines with sustained winds up to an incredible 195 mph. Tacloban itself felt the worst impacts of the storm, being just north of the eye. Haiyan isthe deadliest typhoon on record for the country, having killed at least6,000 people.    Forecast track as of Thursday morning for Typhoon Hagupit from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. (JTWC)  No matter theagency you rely on, the potential error in each of the forecast tracks is huge. The cone of uncertainty in the Joint Typhoon Warning Centers track, for example, extends across nearly all of the islands, putting millions on high alert.      Residents in the central Philippines fled coastal homes and stocked up on supplies as an approaching powerful storm brought back nightmares of last year's deadly onslaught from Typhoon Haiyan. (AP)   GMA News in the Philippines reports that 21 regions in the Philippines have been placed under storm signal alerts, illustrating the uncertainty in the typhoons potential landfall location: The following areas have been placed under Storm Signal No. 2: Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Samar, Biliran, Leyte, Southern Leyte, Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Island, and Siargao Island. Signal No. 1 is raised over Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate including Ticao Island, Cebu City, Northern Cebu, Bantayan Island, Camotes Island, Bohol, Surigao del Sur, Camiguin Island, and Agusan del Norte.    Super Typhoon Hagupits outer bands have already reached the Philippines on Thursday. Landfall is not expected until Saturday or Sunday. (Weather Underground)  Super Typhoon Hagupits outer bands have already reached the Philippines on Thursday morning. However, as forecast, Haguput has begun to slow down as it approaches the island nation, increasing the duration of the storms impacts, and with it the potential for widespread flooding. The center of the typhoon is not expected to make landfall until Saturday or Sunday. In other words, the Philippines will be lashed by Hagupit for multiple days before its impacts finally wane."
The Washington Post,L,The real fight is among the Democrats - The Washington Post,"   FILE  In this May 9, 2013, file photo Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., left, confers with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as the Senate Judiciary Committee meets on immigration reform on Capitol Hill in Washington. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)     By Charles Krauthammer Opinion writer December 4 at 7:54 PM  Follow @krauthammer     Old habits die hard. The media are so enamored of the continuing (and largely contrived) story about the great Republican civil war that they fail to appreciate that the real internecine fight is being waged on the other side of the aisle. I grant that theres a lot of shouting today among Republicans. But its a ritual skirmish over whether a government shutdown would force the president to withdraw a signature measure  last time, Obamacare; this time, executive amnesty.  Charles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays. View Archive   RSS   And it will likely be resolved with the obvious expedient of funding the government through next year, except for a more short-term extension for homeland security. That way, defunding the executive order could be targeted to just the issue at hand, namely immigration, and would occur when the GOP holds the high ground  control of both houses of Congress. Its a tempest in a teapot, and tactical at that. Meanwhile, on the other side, cannons are firing in every direction as the Democratic Party, dazed and disoriented, begins digging itself out of the shambles of six years of Barack Obama. The fireworks began even before Election Day with preemptive back-stabbing  of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, by fellow Democrats. This was followed after the electoral debacle by bitter sniping between Obama and Harry Reid when Reids chief of staff immediately  and on the record  blamed the results on Obama. In turn, Obama got his revenge last week by sabotaging a $450 billion tax extender deal that Reid had painstakingly negotiated. But the Democrats civil war goes far beyond the petty and the personal. Its about fundamental strategy and ideology. The opening salvo was Sen. Chuck Schumers National Press Club speech, an anti-Obama manifesto delivered three weeks after Election Day openly denouncing Obamaism, its policies and priorities. In essence: Elected with a mandate to restore the economy and address the anxieties of a stagnating and squeezed middle class, Obama instead attacked, restructured, reorganized and destabilized a health-care system that was serving the middle class relatively well. Eighty-five percent of Americans already had health insurance, argued Schumer. Yet millions have suffered dislocations for the sake of a minority constituency  the uninsured  barely 13 percent of whom vote. This has alienated the Democrats traditional middle-class constituency. Indeed, in a 2013 poll cited by the New York Times Thomas Edsall, by a margin of 25percent, people said Obamacare makes things better for the poor. But when the question was, does it make things better for people like you, Obamacare came out 16 points underwater. Moreover, for whites, whose support for Democrats hemorrhaged in 2014, 63percent thought Obamacare made things worse for the middle class.  Thats how you lose elections, Schumer argued . And forfeit large chunks of the traditional Democratic coalition. Health care was not a crisis in 2009 (nor in 1993 when Hillarycare led to another Democratic electoral disaster); it was an ideological imperative for Barack Obama and the liberal elites in charge of Congress  their legacy contribution to the welfare state. As are Obamas current cherished causes  climate change and amnesty for illegal immigrants. These are hardly the top priorities of a working and middle class whose median income declined as much during the Obama recovery as during the Great Recession.  The underlying Schumer challenge is that catering to coastal elites and select minorities is how you end up losing 64percent of the white working class   which, though shrinking, is almost 50percent larger in size than the black and Hispanic electorates combined.  While Schumer lobbed artillery at Obamas faculty-room liberalism, the left  through Elizabeth Warrens progressive populism  kept up its fire on the party center. Warren is looking beyond Obama to Hillary Clinton, cozy as Clinton is (Schumer, too) with Wall Street, the bte noire of the party base. Which is why Clinton actually said: Dont let anybody tell you that, you know, its corporations and businesses that create jobs  a stupendously clumsy attempt to parry Warren by parroting her. From opposite sides of the (Democratic) spectrum, Schumer and Warren are trying to remake and reorient the Democratic Party post-Obama. So while Republicans are debating the tactics of stopping presidential lawlessness  an inherently difficult congressional undertaking, particularly if you still control only a single house  Democrats are trying to figure out what they believe and whom they represent. Which do you think is the more serious problem?  Read more from Charles Krauthammers archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

The Washington Post,L,Knox County cop fired immediately after photos show brutal choking of student - The Washington Post," By Nick Kirkpatrick April 28  Follow @n_kirkpatrick   Usually, after charges of police brutality, police officials take their time reacting while they follow procedure to determine who did what. But this episode in Knoxville, Tenn., was so extreme and well-documented that the local sheriff fired the officer immediately. Frank Phillips, a Knox County Sheriffs officer, was fired Sunday night after a series of pictures taken by photographer John Messner were published in the Daily Mail in Britain. They showed an officer identified by the Sheriffs Office as Phillips grabbing 21-year-old college student Jarod Dotson around the neck and squeezing him until he fell to his knees.    An officer identified by the Sheriffs office as Frank Phillips is seen choking college student Jarod Dotson while he was being arrested for public intoxication and resisting arrest. (John Messner)  WBIR reportsthat law enforcement responded to a disturbance near the University of Tennessee where a house party with about 800 people had reportedly become unruly and spilled out into the street. According to a police report, Dotson ignored repeated instructions to go inside,the Knoxville News Sentinel reported. Deputy Brandon Gilliam wrote in the official report that Dotsonbegan to physically resist officers instructions to place his hands behind his back, and at one point grabbed on to an officers leg. Messner, a freelance photographer who documented the incident, told The Washington Post that Dotson showed no signs of resisting arrest. Messners still pictures, arranged by The Post in the GIF below, show two officers cuffing Dotsons hands behind his back when Phillips came over and choked Dotson until he collapsed to his knees. Messner said that as Dotson was being pulled up he was smacked in the back of the head, a snap-out-of-it kinda smack under the circumstances.    An officer identified by the Sheriffs Office as Frank Phillips is seen choking college student Jarod Dotson while he was being arrested for public intoxication and resisting arrest.

Jones said: In my 34 years of law enforcement experience, excessive force has never been tolerated. After an investigation by the Office of Professional Standards, I believe excessive force was used in this incident.

The Washington Post,L,"Defense spending bill passes, sequester must now go - The Washington Post"," By Jennifer Rubin December 4 at 6:30 PM  Follow @JRubinBlogger   The National Defense Authorization Act passed the House today with a huge, bipartisan majority of 300 to 119. The bill to fund the military (in the amount of $585 billion) now goes to the Senate where it has bipartisan support. In an emailed statement, majority leader Kevin McCarthy (R- Calif.) summarized its key provisions: The bill funds troop readiness and also supports our military operations against ISIL in Iraq and Syria, while ensuring increased Congressional oversight on these activities. It also explicitly prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States and denies funding for any terrorist detention facilities on American soil. Notably, the bill also prohibits another round of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process from being carried out in 2015.    Representative Howard Buck McKeon, a Republican from California and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, top right, chairs a hearing with Chuck Hagel, U.S. secretary of defense, not pictured, during a House Armed Services Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, June 11, 2014. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  It did not include a bipartisan measure from Sen. Kristian Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Susan Collins (R-Me.) and others that would have taken investigation and punishment of sexual assaults outside the chain of command. The measure drew harsh objections from the Pentagon and pro-defense lawmakers. A GOP aide sneered, saying senators were in essence giving a sloppy kiss to an amendment that takes authority out of the hands of military commanders, the guys who know their troops the best, and puts it in the hands of government bureaucrats. (Building on past legislation, further reforms supported by the military are included in the House bill.) With regard to the substance of the bill, the House Armed Services Committee summary observed: This years budget request reflects years of compounding resource cuts to national security. Indeed, PresidentObama has directed over $1 trillion in cuts to the military since he took office. The Presidents FY15 basebudget request is $31 billion less than called for in his FY14 budget. His request paid for the cuts bydramatically reducing the size of the military, increasing out of pocket expenses for military families, and cuttingvital programs. Armed Services Members are not prepared to accept a smaller less capable force at this time.Members from both parties worked hard to find savings in less critical areas that do not pose the threat ofirrevocable damage to the force or the potential to harm recruiting or retention. Still, at current resource levels,tough choices must be made. On military readiness the HASC warned: Our military is experiencing ever growing challengesmaintaining readiness as a result of sequestration, leading to a system of tiered readiness where onlydeploying military personnel are fully trained and ready to deploy. To address this concern the NDAA builds onthe work done by Chairman Rob Wittman (R-VA) and the Subcommittee on Readiness to provide over $212billion for operation and maintenance requirements funding activities such as ship refueling and overhaul,depot maintenance, and facilities sustainment. The NDAA further addresses critical readiness gapsassociated with depot maintenance, flying hour programs and base operations support caused bysequestration and repeated resource cuts. These are achieved by diverting funds from lower priority items.Members remain concerned however that if resource trends are not reversed soon, any tentative gains in theseaccounts will be diminished or eliminated. Consistently failing to meet appropriate levels of combat readinessplaces our troops at risk. In a moving goodbye speech, retiring chairman Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) admonished his colleagues to end the sequester limits. Asking them to think of the troops, he deplored the shame in failing to adequately equip, prepare, pay and care for them. Indeed, the next Congress will need to address the knotty issue of the sequester in order to put the military on sound footing and allow it to plan for the future. Sequester is Latin for politicians doing dumb things, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) likes to say. In a Capitol Hill interview with me he vowed to take on the sequester cuts. He was candid that refunding defense will require both sides to give something. He said, There is no social security without national security. . . A strong government starts with a strong national defense. His idea is to buy back most of the sequester with a combination of entitlement reform and closing tax expenditures aimed at discrete businesses. Without opening up all entitlement reform he wants to consider eliminating the Medicare Part D drug subsidy for those making $200,000 or more and extend the budgeting window to stretch out and lessen the yearly reductions. But he will also insist on Pentagon reforms on personnel, acquisition, and retirement to eliminate waste and excess. I will be leading that fight, he says. Graham has been consistent on the sequester.I voted against the sequester, Graham recalled. My concern was that when it comes to Congress expect the worst and you wont be disappointed. As he predicted, the super-committee failed and we are now cannibalizing our own defense. Now here we are and everything I feared would come to pass has. I would say to libertarians in my party [who likely will want all tax loophole savings to go to tax rate reduction] security is the first and biggest obligation of the federal government. The tax code is not going to keep ISIL at bay. He adds, If we cannot buyback the sequester we have lost our way. New pro-defense senators will join Graham, but they will be tested with hard votes. They may imagine they can force the president to take all the savings out of domestic items, but they can stick to that position or solve the problem, but not both with this president. They will need to decide if their rhetoric on the primacy of national security outweighs ideological purity on revenue. McKeon has been exemplary in highlighting the need to replenish the military; now it will be up to Graham and his old and new colleagues to get that job done. "
The Washington Post,L,Denard Span has sports hernia surgery (updated) - The Washington Post," By James Wagner December 3  Follow @jameswagnerwp      (Patrick Smith/Getty Images)  Denard Span underwent sports hernia surgery, the Nationals announced on Wednesday morning. The minor surgery was deemed successful, and the center fielder is expected to be ready for spring training. Span said he tweaked that area toward the end of the season but didnt consider it serious. When he recently started offseason workouts, the injured area felt better but had not improved to the point where he felt it needed to be. He was evaluated and had the surgery.

The Washington Post,L,"In the global struggle for Internet freedom, the Internet is losing, report finds - The Washington Post"," By Nancy Scola December 4 at 12:30 PM  Follow @nancyscola    The year 2014 marks the moment that the world turned its attention to writing laws to govern what happens on the Internet. Andthat has not been a great thing, according to an annual report from the U.S.-based pro-democracy think tank Freedom House. Traditionally, countries eager to crack down on their online critics largely resorted toblocking Web sites andfiltering Internet content, with the occasional offline harassment of dissidents. But that has changed, in part because online activists havegotten better at figuring out waysaround those restrictions; Freedom House points toGreatfire, a service that takes content blocked in mainland China and hosts it on big, global platforms, like Amazon's servers, that the Chinese government finds both politically and technologically difficult to block. In the wake of these tactics, repressive regimes have begun opting for a ""technically uncensored Internet,"" Freedom House finds, but one that is increasingly controlled by national laws about what can and can't be done online. In 36 of the 65 countries surveyed around the world the state of Internet freedom declined in 2014, according to the report. Russia, for example, passed a law that allows the country's prosecutor general to block ""extremist"" Web sites without any judicial oversight. Kazakstan passed a similar law. Vietnam passed decrees cracking down on any critiques of the state on social media sites. Nigeria passed a law requiring that Internetcafeskeep logs of the customers who come into their shops and use their computers. There's a bigger worry at work, too, Freedom House says: the potential for a ""snowball effect."" More and more countries, the thinking goes, will adopt these sorts of restrictive laws. And the more that such laws are put in place, the more they fall within the range of acceptable global norms. Also shifting those norms? According to Freedom House, ""Some states are using the revelations of widespread surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as an excuse to augment their own monitoring capabilities, frequently with little or no oversight, and often aimed at the political opposition and human rights activists."" Indeed, in the United States, too, 2014 has been a time of writing rules about the Internet into law. The Federal Communications Commissionwill not manage to wrap up work on so-called net neutrality rulemaking by Dec. 31, but there's no doubt that this year marks the first timethe American public got hugely engaged in thedebate over how the Internet should operate within our borders. It's worth noting that there were afew bright spots elsewhere in the report. India relaxed a rule on online access and content that it had put in place last year afterriots in the country's northeast. Meanwhile, Brazil passed an ""Internet bill of rights"" -- calledMarco Civil da Internet -- that has both net neutrality and privacy protections. This year also saw the start of a global attempt to create a set of pro-Internet model laws under the banner of the NETmundialInitiative, with the support of Brazil and the nonprofit Internet governance organization ICANN. But that effort is only just now getting off the ground. And as the Freedom House report shows, world leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and others aren't waiting around for its guidance."
The Washington Post,L,Body cameras wont stop police brutality. Eric Garner is only one of several reasons why. - The Washington Post,"  By Justin Hansford December 4 at 2:02 PM Follow @Blackstarjus  Justin Hansford is a human rights activist and law professor at Saint Louis University School of Law. He is a graduate of Howard University and Georgetown University Law Center.      Video evidence of the fatal chokehold that killed Eric Garner didnt help indict the police officer. (NY Daily News via Getty Images)  President Obama announced this week a proposal to spend $75 million onbody cameras for50,000 police officers nationwide. He framed this as a solution to widespreaddistrust of law enforcementin minoritycommunities. But the failure to indict the New York City police officer whose chokehold killed Eric Garner an incident vividly capturedon video proves just how ineffective Obamas plan would beincurbing epidemic police violence and racial profiling. Theofficers who forcibly pushedGarners body into the ground knew awitness was recording the incident, andat least oneof themspoke to the videographer. And yet, the police were undeterred. Theycontinued using the bannedchokehold on Garner as he repeatedly said, I cant breathe! In the Garner case, the cellphonevideo provided a far superior view of what happened than a body camera would have, and still police suffered no criminal consequences. Its not the first time this has happened. In September, an Ohio grand jury failed to indict the police officers who killed John Crawford in a Wal-Mart, where he had picked up an air rifle from the shelf. And earlier this year,a man in Oklahoma stopped breathingin a movie theater parking lot after several police officersforced him to the groundwhen he refused to hand overhis ID. His wife filmed the fatal incident on her cellphone, but the district attorney said the officers actions were justified. Officers are rarely charged in these kinds of incidents, whether theres video evidence or not. Duringthe seven years ending in 2011, just 41 police officers werecharged with murder or manslaughter aftershootings, according to FBI statistics compiled by TheWall Street Journal. Meanwhile, more than 2,700 homicides by law enforcement were deemed justified.Few entities aregiven so much authority with so little accountability. Ultimately, body camerascoulddo more harm than good to the cause of protecting citizens from police violence. Pinned to officers chests, thesecameras face outward  capturing the behavior of citizens, but not of the police. Their footage provides a one-sided view of the interaction, allowing outsiders to scrutinize the citizens every move, but leaving them blind to the police officers behavior. For instance, while protesting in Ferguson, I witnessed police pointing guns at nonviolent citizens. Mediacameras and citizens cellphones captured some of that behavior, as well. But policebody cameras only would have shown citizens angry reactions out of context, missing the officers provocation. Body camerasdomuch more tocapture evidence against citizens than to protect them. Its lax laws that prevent us from holding police accountable, not a lack of evidence.Butthe presence of police bodycameras will simply lullthe country into believingthat wecansolve the problems of racial profiling and police violence without holding police accountable for their actions. In an environment where state excessive force laws make criminal conviction of police officers for murder almost impossible, a police officer literally has nothing to lose by killing unarmed black men. Even in civil suits,officers are never personally financially responsible for paying for damages  state and local governments cover itfor them. For the officers involved, there is a miniscule chance of either serving time in jail or paying a dime in damages, regardless of whether or not the incident is recorded. This is the textbook definition of impunity. In addition to their ineffectiveness, the information captured by body cameras raises serious questions about citizen privacy. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure and many jurisdictions prohibit recording of a person without his or her consent if the surveillance takes place in an area of expected privacy. Police enter areas of this type every day. Also, the recent scandals surrounding NSA surveillance of telephone and Internet activity has already demonstrated the nations uneasiness about the proliferation of digital surveillance capacity among law enforcement under the guise of keeping us safe.We have yet to fully explore the Fourth Amendment ramifications of this type of constant recording of citizens by police officers. The big brother state stands in direct contradiction to the freedom from unreasonable searches that the Fourth Amendment guarantees us. President Obama isnt alone in his misguided approach. Across the country, local police departments are considering the use of body cameras andperpetuating the view that this will end police brutality.But if this country wants to get serious about this problem, we should do what government always does when it wants to alter behavior on a systematic level  impose financial penalties. For example, the proposed End Racial Profiling Act would mandatepolicies that prohibit racial profiling byfederal law enforcementand bystate and local agencies thatreceivefederal funding. Thats a start on the racial profiling side. Another proposal that has gained traction locally is the creation of mandatory personal liability insurance for police officers. Even if cities decide to pay the base premiums for police, the increased premiums for officers prone to violence and brutality would provide a measure of accountability. Thats a start on the police violence side.In the absence of accountability, financial or criminal, we can expect no changes in police behavior. The roots of the problem are too deep. For real change to happen, it has to cost them something. More from PostEverything:  What caused the Ferguson riot exists in so many other cities, too Filming police is the American thing to do. As a federal prosecutor, I know how hard it is to charge officers like Darren Wilson"

The Washington Post,L,"The strength, and limits, of de Blasios speech about Eric Garner - The Washington Post"," By Jena McGregor December 4 at 9:18 AM  Follow @jenamcgregor      (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasiogave a poignantand powerfulspeech on Wednesdayin the wake of a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer who putEric Garner in a chokehold that led to his death in July. His remarkspreceded a night of protests throughout the city that blocked traffic on the city's West Side Highway, prompted ""die-ins"" at Grand Central Terminal, and inspired hundreds of protestors to march through the streets chanting ""I can't breathe,"" Garner's last words. De Blasio's speech is unlikely to blunt criticism of the ""broken windows"" policing approach that may have played a role in what happened to Eric Garner  orin the simmeringdistrust of police in Ferguson, Mo., where teenager Michael Brown's death sparked riots and nationalprotests. But de Blasio'swords, as well as hisdecision to cancel a bill signing and anappearance at the Rockefeller Center tree lighting eventto insteadhead to Staten Island, stood in stark contrast to the public officials in Ferguson who often seemedabsentas the crisis unfoldedthere. In the speech, de Blasiospoke of the fear too many young people have of police. He sent a signalto those angry on social media, in their homes and in the streets, by echoing the line ""black lives matter""  a refrain from the protests ""that should never have to be said,"" but that ""our history, sadly, requires."" And, movingly, de Blasiosharedhis own personal story:the challenges of raisinga biracial son in communities wheredistrust of the policehas only grown. ""We've had to literally train him, as families have all over this city for decades, in how to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers,"" de Blasio said. He spoke of the worry, and the very real pain, of being that parent today. Again, he made his remarks personal while also repeating that his concerns are shared by millions of other families.""WasDante safe each night? There are so many families in this city who feel that each and every night. Is my child safe? And not just from some of the painful realities  crime and violence in some of our neighborhoods  but are theysafe from the very people they want to have faith in as their protectors?"" That ability to empathize may be a unique advantage de Blasio possesses. It's a ""rhetorical strength,"" as the New York Timeswrote, that made him appear to be ""trying to preside over the day's events, rather than to steer them."" His wife isAfrican American, his children are biracial, and he can speak about the fear and challenges of parenting them with a credibility that many other elected leaders cannot. Andhe used that perspectiveto great effect, speaking as a fatherandsharingwords that had the power to resonated with grieving, angry families. Whatever goodwill his speech engendered will not, of course, be enough to quiet critics who question the policing approach that is associated with thepolice chief he hired, William Bratton. De Blasiocampaigned on ending the police department's controversial""stop-and-frisk"" tactics, and brought on Bratton a year ago this week to helphim do so. Butmanysee the controversial ""broken windows"" approach, which has police aggressively go after small crimes in order to prevent bigger ones, aspart of the problem. Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) has called it ""just a cousin to stop-and-frisk."" At the very least, de Blasio should initiate acritical review of the real effectiveness,versus potential damage,of policies that focus on petty crimes.And he should ensure that Bratton's earlier callfor a ""fundamental shift in the culture of the department,"" as well as his promises to rid the force of officers ""who [are]'brutal,' who are 'corrupt,' who are 'racist,' who are 'incompetent,'"" are followed up by palpable changes. De Blasio's speechwas poignantbecause it waspersonal, credible andempathetic. He demonstrated that he understands this is a timeof searing pain for many communities. It was the right speech for the moment. But thenext one needs to outlineaccountableaction in reforming a police department that is still much in need of real change.

The Washington Post,L,"Catherine Rampell: Men want women to be equal, but the system defeats them - The Washington Post","    (BIGSTOCKPHOTO/BIGSTOCKPHOTO)     By Catherine Rampell Opinion writer December 4 at 7:43 PM  Follow @crampell     Most men aspire to be egalitarian. They really do.  Its just that life  by which I mean employers, social pressures and tax policy  gets in the way.  Catherine Rampell is an opinion columnist at The Washington Post. View Archive   Google+   Harvard Business School recently released some heavily dissected survey data on the career paths of 25,000 alumni. The findings that got the most attention related to womens initial expectations  ultimately dashed  of achieving family arrangements that would allow their own careers to flourish. But the most interesting results, in my opinion, related to the men surveyed. While Harvard women said they had (often wrongly) expected to land in egalitarian partnerships, Harvard men said theyd known all along that they would end up in relatively traditional, 1950s-style nuclear families. Majorities of men said that, at the time of graduation, they expected that their own career would take precedence over their spouses and that their spouse would take primary responsibility for the kids. So whats going on here? Are Crimson men just sexist jerks? They certainly look more chauvinistic than American men more broadly. At least at first blush.  In 2011, CBS News polled Americans on which kind of marriage offered the more satisfying way of life: one where the man works and the woman takes care of house and children, or one where both spouses have jobs, do housework and take care of the kids. Perhaps unsurprisingly, men were more likely than women to say they preferred the more traditional arrangement. Heres what was surprising: Even among the men, the marital traditionalists were a small minority. That is, two-thirds of men professed a preference for egalitarian marriage.  In fact, at every income level and age group (even the Mad Men-era types!), a majority of men said they preferred marriages in which both partners worked and shared household and child-care responsibilities. This is perplexing. In reality, such marital arrangements are not the norm. Women are far more likely to be the primary caregivers and to be out of the labor force than men are when in two-parent households (which are on the decline, by the way). Somehow these egalitarian aspirations are not materializing. Economists often distinguish between stated preferences and revealed preferences. (You might say you love salads, but if youre ordering burgers every meal, youve revealed a different preference.) Maybe survey respondents are just trying to sound enlightened. Im inclined to think their answers are genuine, though; their ideals are just not compatible with the institutions and social norms around them.  Truly egalitarian fathers have to make sacrifices at work, says Kathleen Gerson, a New York University sociology professor and author of The Unfinished Revolution. Thats something theyre not always prepared to do.  After decades of rhetoric validating womens choices to opt in or opt out, women often resolve work-life conflict by pulling back from work. Thats less often true for men, who are still plagued by a masculine mystique that says they need to be strong breadwinners. Bosses and co-workers frown upon men who request flexible schedules or parental leaves, too. Perhaps as a result, survey data show that fathers today report greater levels of work-life tension, along with anguish about not being home enough, than mothers do. Men usually earn more than their wives, too, which makes it especially financially painful for them to ratchet back at the office. (This calculus amplifies the gender pay gap, of course.) Whatever their preferences for a satisfying marriage, spouses deal with the constraints they face by reverting to traditional, specialized and frequently unsatisfying gender roles.  Which brings me back to the Harvard results. I suspect the real reason these elite men seek out traditional male-breadwinner families is not that they believe the Second Sex deserves to stay barefoot, house-coated and pregnant. Its that theyre practical. They spent two years studying how to develop successful careers and businesses, which includes understanding both how real-world companies work and what kind of team (at work, and at home) one needs to thrive financially.  Theyre also members of a socioeconomic class that invests substantially more time in their children today than in the past, meaning they may feel they need a spouse who has time to be an active parent. Sure, Harvard MBAs may have greater resources to hire help so both spouses can work in demanding careers, but the tax system, through both the marriage penalty and nanny taxes, often discourages them from doing so.  Such institutional obstacles to equality can reinforce normative ones, of course (like that masculine mystique I mentioned earlier). But our norms are already evolving. Its the institutions that are standing in the way of real progress.   Read more from Opinions:    Ruth Marcus: For pregnant women, a needed accommodation   Lauren E.

The Washington Post,L,"The standing problem in Zivotofsky, revisited - The Washington Post"," By Will Baude December 4 at 3:43 PM   Teaching Zivotofsky yesterday I found myself wondering: why havent any members of the Court questioned Zivotofskys standing to sue? Zivotofsky is of course the Jersualem passport case pending before the Supreme Court, which is being asked to decide whether Section 214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act is constitutional. But has Zivotofsky suffered theinjury in fact required by the Courts standing doctrine, and thus required for the Court to decide the case? The district court initially said no. It took the Courts decision in Lujan (and now one could add Summers) to say that a violation of a statutory right isnt adequate for standing. And it didnt think that there was any other concrete injury outside of the legal injury. The D.C. Circuit disagreed with the first point, concluding that in general violations of statutory rights do create standing. Co-blogger Eugene K. and Steve Vladeck went back and forth about this earlier this year. Eugene argued that the statute does not create a right and therefore that it cant support standing. Steve responded that this objection really goes to the existence of a cause of action; the statute does create a right. Im slow to the party, but Im wondering about something slightly more basic. What about the district courts objection, that even if the statute does create a right, that right isnt a cognizable injury under Article III standing doctrine? In his post, Steve had written I dont think theres any question, as Ive explained in the surveillance context, that Congress may create non-common-law rights as a general proposition, and then confer standing upon a wide array of private individuals who, through an appropriate cause of action, may enforce them. And while Im sympathetic to Steves views here, it seems to me that some members of the Court have questioned that general proposition. This was discussed most fervently during the oral argument in First American Financial v. Edwards. Heres Chief Justice Roberts: Can I  Im sorry to interrupt you, and I want to pause on that question. You said violation of a statute is injury-in-fact. I would have thought that would be called injury-in-law. And when we say, as all our standing cases have, is that what is required is injury-in-fact, I understand that to be in contradistinction to injury-in-law. And when you tell me all that youve got or all that you want to plead is violation of the statute, that doesnt sound like injury-in-fact. And again: You say so long as the harm is a violation of the law, a legally protected interest. Our standing cases always say injury-in-fact as opposed to injury-in-law. And yet, youre saying if you violate the law, you have sufficient injury. Now First American Financial was eventually dismissed. The Court has called for the views of the SG in a new case that looks to me like it might raise the question again, Spokeo v. Robins, but it seems to remain an open question whether the injury-in-law skepticism will prevail. In any event: for those Justices who are skeptical, and who dont accept Steves limited reading of Lujan, shouldnt Zivotofskys standing actually be in serious doubt? The standing issue doesnt seem to have been raised in the principal briefs, although I did find this amicus brief which raises the issues (and relies on Eugene Ks post too). But because standing is jurisdictional, each Justice is supposed to satisfy himself or herself that it exists before they go on to consider the merits. It seems to me that each Justice who doubts standing in First American Financial or Spokeo ought to doubt standing here too. And if not, at a minimum they ought to explain why not. On the other hand, if recent practice is any guide, the Court will just ignore the issue. "

In a three-decade career at The Post, Robinson has been city hall reporter, city editor, foreign correspondent in Buenos Aires and London, foreign editor, and assistant managing editor in charge of the papers Style section. View Archive   Facebook RSS   In the depressing reality series that should be called No Country for Black Men, this sick plot twist was shocking beyond belief. There should have been an indictment in the Ferguson case, in my view, but at least the events that led to Michael Browns killing were in dispute. Garners homicide was captured on video. We saw him being choked, heard him plead of his distress, watched as no attempt was made to revive him and his life slipped away. This time, there were literally millions of eyewitnesses. Somebody tell me, just theoretically, how many does it take? Is there any number that would suffice? Or is this whole equal justice before the law thing just a cruel joke? African American men are being taught a lesson about how this society values, or devalues, our lives. Ive always said the notion that racism is a thing of the past was absurd  and that those who espoused the post-racial myth were either naive or disingenuous. Now, tragically, you see why. Garner, 43, was an African American man. On July 17, he allegedly committed the heinous crime of selling individual cigarettes on the street. A group of New York City police officers approached and surrounded him. As seen in cellphone video footage recorded by an onlooker, Garner was puzzled that the officers seemed to be taking him into custody for such a piddling offense. He was a big man, but at no point did he strike out at the officers or show them disrespect. But he wasnt assuming a submissive posture as quickly as the cops wanted. Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a chokehold, compressing his windpipe  a maneuver that the New York Police Department banned two decades ago. Garner complained repeatedly that he was having trouble breathing. The officers wrestled him to the sidewalk, where he died. An emergency medical crew was summoned, but officers made no immediate attempt to resuscitate him. The coroner ruled Garners death a homicide. He suffered from asthma, and Pantaleos chokehold killed him. The Staten Island prosecutor presented evidence against Pantaleo to a grand jury; the other officers involved in the incident were given immunity in exchange for their testimony. On Wednesday, it was announced that the grand jury had declined to indict Pantaleo on any charge. This travesty  theres no other word for it  came just nine days after a St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson for Browns death. Demonstrators took to the streets across Manhattan. What else was there to do but protest? Set aside the signs that say Hands Up, Dont Shoot. Bring out the signs that say I Cant Breathe. There are two big issues here. One involves the excessive license we now give to police  permission, essentially, to do whatever they must to guarantee safe streets. The pendulum has clearly swung too far in the law-and-order direction, at the expense of liberty and justice.  As I wrote Tuesday, we are so inured to fatal shootings by police officers that we do not even make a serious effort to count them; the Brown case illustrated this numbness to the use of deadly force. Garners death is part of a different trend: The broken windows theory of policing, which holds that cracking down on minor, nuisance offenses  such as selling loose cigarettes  is key to reducing serious crime.     Protests erupted after a grand jury cleared a white police officer Wednesday in the videotaped chokehold death of unarmed black man Eric Garner. Garner had been stopped for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. (AP)   Police officers, whose brave work I honor and respect, are supposed to serve communities, not rule them. The other big issue, inescapably, is race. The greatest injury of the Brown and Garner cases is that grand juries examined the evidence and decided there was no probable cause  a very low standard  to believe the officers did anything wrong. I find it impossible to believe this would be the result if the victims were white. Garner didnt even fit into the young black male category that defines this nations most feared and loathed citizens. He was an overweight, middle-age, asthmatic man. Now were told that the man who killed him did nothing wrong. Eric Garner was engaged in an activity that warranted no more than a warning to move along. But I recognize that he also committed a capital offense: He was the wrong color.  Read more from Eugene Robinsons archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

The Washington Post,L,Investigation: Afghan shooter ambushed slain Army general at close range - The Washington Post," By Dan Lamothe December 4 at 9:15 AM  Follow @danlamothe      Then-Brig. Gen. Harold Greene addresses a crowd in 2011. He was killed in a shooting in Afghanistan on Aug. 5. (U.S. Army photo)  Themass shooting that killed a two-star Army generaland wounded 18 other people in Afghanistan on Aug. 5 was carried out by a lone Afghan soldier who did not have any apparent ties to the Taliban and who simply seized a target of opportunity, according to a U.S. military investigation.    This photo of Rafiqullah, 22, is included in a U.S. Central Command report released Thursday. He opened fire on coalition and Afghan troops in Afghanistan, killing Army Maj. Gen. Harold Greene. (Photo released by the U.S. military)  The investigation, released by U.S. Central Command on Thursday, found that Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, of Falls Church, Va., died immediately after being shot multiple times in the pelvis, head and neck by an army private named Rafiqullah, 22, who also was killed in the incident. The report found that Rafiqullah opened fire from a bathroom window in a military police barracks less than 15 meters away from the nearest person he targeted. He had previously expressed disdain for Americans. Greene was the highest-ranking U.S. officer killed in a combat zone since the Vietnam War. The others wounded in the shooting included German Army Brig. Gen. Michael Bartscher and Afghan Brig. Gen. Miyan-Yar Gulalm Sahki. The names of the others wounded are redacted from the newly released documents, but they include 10 Americans, three Afghans and two individuals from Britain. The attack occurred at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University. The facility, in the Qarga district of Kabul province and west of the city, was known as the Afghan National Defense University until this year. Greene, the deputy commanding general of Combined Security Command  Afghanistan, and the others were at the academy to review and discuss a construction project that was underway and highlight the schools potential to train Afghan officers. The report said that Rafiqullah was not believed to have been a member of the Taliban or any other extremist group. He may have been self-radicalized or had a mental illness, investigators found. He fired between 27 to 30 rounds from an M-16 that carried up to 30 in its magazine, and was killed by coalition service members. It appears the shooting was not premeditated, and the shooter simply took advantage of a target of opportunity provided by the close gathering, according to the investigation report, completed by Army Brig. Gen. Donald E. Jackson Jr. An Afghan interpreter for a contractor at the academy told investigators that Rafiqullah had expressed dislike for Americans before. The shooter had previously challenged the interpreter on why he worked for Americans, and the interpreter responded that in doing so, he also was helping the Afghan National Army. The answer seemed to satisfy Rafiqullah, the interpreter recalled. The shooter also had grievances with his own Afghan military commanders. He had been denied time off recently, and was frustrated after working a double shift recently while other Afghan soldiers relaxed, Afghan troops said. Some Afghan soldiers expressed surprise about his involvement in the attack, saying he was well liked in their unit. Photographs included in the report released Thursday underscore how close together the ambushed troops were when Rafiqullah began shooting. The photographs were likely available because the shooting occurred during a meeting of senior officers. This image released by CENTCOM shows he attack site afterward. Investigators labeled the window used by Rafiqullah with a red dot:    This photograph shows the site of the Aug. 5 mass shooting in Afghanistan that killed Maj. Gen. Harold Greene and wounded 18 others. (Photo released by U.S. Central Command)  This image, taken 10 minutes before the shooting, shows how close Americans and Afghans were standing at the training academy before the attack. Investigators labeled those who were later wounded with a red dot:    This image released by U.S. officials shows the scene of the Aug. 5 shooting in Afghanistan that killed Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, 10 minutes before it occurred. (U.S. Central Command photo)  The window the shooter used opened outward, limiting the angles at which he could shoot. This photograph released by U.S. officials shows it riddled with bullet holes after American troops returned fire and hit Rafiqullah:    The window Rafiqullah used to open fire on U.S., coalition and Afghan troops on Aug. 5. (Photo released by U.S. Central Command)  Coalition troops cleared the building that Rafiqullah used to make sure that there werent any other threats, and found him barely breathing while slumped in a bathroom shower stall. They checked him for explosives, and he died moments later, the investigation found. Some witnesses said they heard shots from within the bathroom after Rafiqullahs attack, raising the question whether Afghan soldiers inside the building shot at him. Investigators could not determine who fired the fatal shots."
The Washington Post,L,Obama to nominate next secretary of defense tomorrow - The Washington Post," By Missy Ryan December 4 at 2:15 PM  Follow @missy_ryan      Ashton Carter, who is widely expected to be President Obamas nominee as secretary of defense, testifies on Capitol Hill in February 2013. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  President Barack Obama will nominate a new defense chief on Friday to replace Chuck Hagel, who is departing the Pentagon as the United States expands its fight against Islamic State militants in the Middle East, the White House said on Thursday. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters the announcement would be made on Friday but declined to say who the presidents nominee would be. Current and former officials say that Obama will nominate Ashton B. Carter, a physicist and former academic who previously served as the Pentagons second highest ranking official, for the job. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, announced that he would depart the Pentagon following weeks of speculation about a rift between the Pentagon leadership and the White House. Hagel, a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war, took over in early 2013 charged with reforming the Pentagon budget and ushering the U.S. military out of a dozen years of war. But senior officials indicated that Obama wanted a change as the U.S. military broadens its operations in Iraq and Syria against the extremist group that captured a wide swathe of territory in both countries. Senior lawmakers have indicated their support for Carter, who as deputy defense secretary oversaw the massive Pentagon budget and its weapons procurement."

The Washington Post,L,Could Barry sue Lena Dunham over her memoirs? - The Washington Post," By Eugene Volokh December 4 at 5:55 PM  Follow @volokhc      Actress Lena Dunham holds her memoir, Not That Kind of Girl, ahead of a book signing in Piccadilly in central London in October. (Joel Ryan/Invision via Associated Press)  A reader writes: I think  VC/Wapo readers (including those sympathetic to Ms. Dunham) would be interested in your thoughts on whether Barry One (as the  Breitbart article refers to him) has a potential cause of action against Lena Dunham and/or Random House for negligence, [intentional infliction of emotional distress], false light, libel, whatever (assuming he can prove that he did not rape or otherwise have sex with Ms. Dunham as described in her memoir). At least to me, the question of whether an author can be held liable (consistent with the First Amendment) for intentionally or unintentionally (but negligently, if proved) ruining an innocent persons reputation or life, is very interesting . And in the Breitbart article, it mentions that Barry has hired a lawyer, so legal action may be being contemplated (in the Kevin Williamson piece in National Review  Barry expresses that this is taking an immense, negative toll on him and his family). A very interesting question, to which it turns out that theres a good legal answer (assuming we can figure out the facts). 1. Lena Dunhams memoir describes her having sex with someone named Barry, whom she labels as Oberlins resident conservative. Her description seems to me to leave it somewhat ambiguous as to whether Barry raped her, but it does describe some sexual behavior by Barry that at the very least reflects badly on him. There are two passages in which she describes the incident: one in which it comes across as consensual but unsatisfying, and another one that she begins by saying, Im an unreliable narrator. Because I add an invented detail to almost every story I tell about my mother. Because my sister claims every memory we share has been fabricated by me to impress a crowd. Because I get sick a lot. Because I use the same low duhhh voice for every guy Ive ever known, except for the put-off adult voice I use to imitate my dad. But mostly because in another essay in this book I describe a sexual encounter with a mustachioed campus Republican as the upsetting but educational choice of a girl who was new to sex when, in fact, it didnt feel like a choice at all. The pages that follow, which thus seem to purportedly describe what happened in fact, give a good number of details of Barrys alleged sexual behavior toward her; see the Breitbart News story (John Nolte, Big Hollywood) for some of those details. 2. The Breitbart News story states that there was indeed a well-known conservative student at Oberlin named Barry and that he could easily be identified by people who want to figure out who he is and that he has indeed been so identified by many people. (I indeed managed to do this easily myself.) Kevin Williamson (National Review), a prominent critic of Dunhams, reports the same. But the Breitbart News story also alleges that the other details in Dunhams story, such as Barrys appearance (e.g., his mustache) and campus job (e.g., his having hosted a radio talk show called Real Talk With Jimbo), seem to be inaccurate. And the story alleges that there was no one else named Barry who was a prominent campus conservative. From there, Breitbart News expresses doubts that Dunham actually was involved in such an incident with a conservative named Barry. 3. So those are the facts (item 1, which I can attest to personally, having looked at Dunhams memoir) and the allegations that Dunhams account is incorrect (item 2, the substance of which I cant verify personally). Assuming that the Breitbart allegations are correct, would Dunhams statements be legally actionable, if Identifiable Conservative Barry sues? The answer doesnt require us to delve into negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress, because this would be a classic defamation case. Identifiable Conservative Barry would argue that  Dunham said things about him that injured his reputation with some people because some people reasonably identified him as the Barry she mentions and yet, those statements were false, in that no conservative Oberlin student named Barry actually did to her what she says was done to her, even if someone else with another name or other identifying characteristics did this, and Dunham knew that the statements were false, in that she knew that no conservative Oberlin Barry did this to her.  Nor does it matter that Barrys last name was not used. As the Restatement (Second) of Torts says (emphasis and some paragraph breaks added), A defamatory communication is made concerning the person to whom its recipient correctly, or mistakenly but reasonably, understands that it was intended to refer. Comment b. Person mistakenly but reasonably believed to be intended. If the communication is reasonably understood by the person to whom it is made as intended to refer to the plaintiff, it is not decisive that the defamer did not intend to refer to him. It is not enough however, that the defamatory matter is actually understood as intended to refer to the plaintiff; the interpretation must be reasonable in the light of all the circumstances. It is not necessary that the plaintiff be designated by name; it is enough that there is such a description of or reference to him that those who hear or read reasonably understand the plaintiff to be the person intended. It is not necessary that everyone recognize the other as the person intended; it is enough that any recipient of the communication reasonably so understands it. [T]he defamer is subject to liability if he knew that the communication would be understood by the recipient to refer to the plaintiff or was negligent in failing to recognize that this might happen. If the recipient reasonably understood the communication to be made concerning the plaintiff, it may be inferred that the defamer was negligent in failing to realize that the communication would be so understood. To be sure, if this sort of misunderstanding happens without fault on the speakers part, or when its unreasonable for people to assume the statement is about the plaintiff, there would be no liability. If I write accurately about something bad done by someone I identify only as Bill, that isnt a basis for every Bill in the world to sue me, claiming that the statement libels him. I accurately reported the facts, its unreasonable for people to assume just based on the name Bill that my statement is about any Bill in particular, and its therefore reasonable for me just to call him Bill. Likewise, if I write an obviously fictional story that mentions someone named Cathy, and even give quite a few details, its generally unreasonable for people to assume that this is about any particular Cathy (even one who happens to share the description I offered in my fictional work). At least this is so unless theres some indication that the reference really isnt entirely fictional; theres actually some interesting and controversial case law on facially fictional accounts that are nonetheless seen as implicitly making factual claims. But say I write something that on its face seems to be, and is reasonably perceived to be, a factual claim that someone did something bad to me. And say I use a first name coupled with identifying characteristics that would lead reasonable people to perceive that the person is a particular person. People do so reasonably perceive, but it turns out that my account was wrong the incident actually involved someone with a different first name, or different identifying characteristics. Unless I made a reasonable mistake, I would be potentially liable for defamation. And that would be the Dunham story, if the Breitbart assertions are correct, and Dunham knew (or at least should have known) that the incident didnt involve an Oberlin conservative named Barry. To be sure, people who knew Identifiable Conservative Barry very well would realize that her story couldnt be about him (again, assuming the Breitbart report is right), since he never had the mustache that Dunham described and never worked on the radio show that Dunham mentioned. But people who know some details about Identifiable Conservative Barry he was named Barry, he was conservative, he was at Oberlin at the same time Dunham was whether because they know him personally or because they track him down using those details, would perceive him as the Barry that Dunham was talking about. And the damage to his reputation in those peoples eyes would be sufficient for a libel claim (again, assuming the facts are as Breitbart reports). 4. But theres one important twist: Any such libel lawsuit is dangerous for plaintiffs in this situation, even if they are entirely innocent. Right now, only a relatively few people link Identifiable Conservative Barrys name to Dunhams story, precisely because his last name wasnt used. If Identifiable Conservative Barry sues, he becomes Identified Conservative Barry, and many more people will link his name to Dunhams story. Then, even if he prevails in court, or gets Dunham to publish an apology, some people will have learned of the accusation but wont hear (or remember or believe) the vindication. This, for better or worse (or perhaps sometimes for better and sometimes for worse), is one of the costs of libel litigation: It amplifies the original accusation, and sometimes it takes a statement that injured the plaintiffs reputation only among a few people and turns it into a statement that injured his reputation among many again, even if he ultimately wins the case. Sometimes a sad reality, but a reality nonetheless."
The Washington Post,L,Orion test flight scrubbed due to valve problems - The Washington Post," By Christian Davenport December 4 at 10:06 AM  Follow @_chrisdavenport        NASA officials delayed the scheduled launch of the Orion space capsule until Friday due to a last-minute technical problem. (Reuters)   The historic launch ofOrion, NASAs much-heralded, next-generation spacecraft, was scrubbedThursday because of faulty valves. The decision came afterrepeated delays caused by strong winds and even an errant boat that appeared to move too close to the launch site. Up until the final minutes before the close of the launch window,NASA officials held out hopes oftesting thecraft designed to ultimately bring humans to Mars. But after a tense morning, several fuel and drain valves that did not function properly finally forced officials to postpone the mission. The next launch window is Friday at 7:05 a.m. EST. But officials said there was only a ""40 percent chance of favorable weather conditions"" for a launch Friday morning. The uncrewed spacecraft had been scheduled tolift off at 7:05 a.m.Thursday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket, en route to a 4.5 hour flight that would take it twice around Earth and to an altitude of 3,600 miles-- farther than any spacecraft designed for humans has traveled in more than 40 years. As the morning unfolded, a NASA official had said on the agency's live web stream that there have been a ""number of minor issues,"" but no ""show stoppers."" At one point, theofficial said Orion ""stands ready for launch"" as crews waited for the wind to die down. In a statement, the United Launch Alliance, the joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that makes the Delta IV rocket, said that while ""the liquid hydrogen fill and drain valves...did not properly close within the allotted time,"" the spacecraft ""has no technical or operational issues and remains ready for launch."" Daniel Collins, ULA's chief operating officer, told reporters Thursday afternoon that the valves ""had gotten cold and a little sluggish in their performance."" He said that the team was ""listening to everything the rocket was telling us. And it told us it wasn't ready to go today. So we'll go make sure we have a happy rocket. And as soon as we do that we're going to get back to the pad and send Orion off for a very successful test flight.""           1 of 6       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                       Skip Ad              Awaiting the launch of Orion spacecraft    View Photos   The test flight of NASAs next-generation spacecraft was repeatedly delayed and then canceled Thursday.

Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.       The months-long hype and anticipation leading up to Orion's test flight reached a crescendo this weekas NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden cast the launch in history-making terms, saying that ""Neil Armstrong and the Apollo astronauts paved the way for this day."" Speaking on NASA TV Thursday morning, he said that ""Mars is the ultimately goal for this generation."" The Orion does not have any people on board. That's not expected to happen for another seven or eight years. But the test flight will go a long way to eventually getting humans further than they've every gone before, NASA officials say. One of the key tests will be Orion's heat shield, which will face temperatures of 4,000 degrees when the capsule barrels into the atmosphere at 20,000 mph. Officials from NASA and Lockheed Martin, the massive Bethesda-based contractor that built Orion, will also be watching to see how it performs the various ""separating events,"" and how it handles the extreme radiation of deep space. Another key test will be the series of parachutes that deploy to slow Orion down before it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean, which is expected to occur four hours and 25 minutes after takeoff. Mark Geyer, NASA's Orion Program Manager, said that flying the Orion without a crew wouldallow NASA to test the most risky systems: ""We intend to stress the systems and make sure they behave as we designed them to. The last time a spacecraft designed for human travel left Low Earth Orbit was the 1972 Apollo 17 mission, also the last timeastronauts walked on the moon. Since then, human flights have been restricted to Low Earth Orbit, home to the International Space Station. But Thursday's flight will go 15 times as far. Sometime in the 2020s, NASA plans to capture anasteroid with a robotic spacecraft, then drag it to the moons orbit where it would connect with the Orion. Astronauts would then be able to take samples from the asteroid. The big target, however, remains Mars. And Thursdays test flight will help put Mars within the reach of astronauts in the 2030s, NASA says. While the Orion was initially part of a program, called Constellation, designed to return to moon, its mission changed afterthe Obama administration killed Constellation and made Mars the goal. Thursday's mission would haveused a Delta IV Heavy rocket, made by United launch Alliance, ajoint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But future Orion missions would use the new Space Launch System rocket, which is still being developed. Bolden has called testing Orion""a continuation of what Apollo started."" ""We've taken a 40-year hiatus,"" he said. ""And now we're back on track."" "
The Washington Post,L,"Star Wars, Episode VII: Please, for the love of God, as little politics as possible - The Washington Post","  By Daniel W. Drezner December 4 at 9:39 AM Follow @dandrezner  Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at Tufts University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.      The thought of the next Star Wars film being an allegory of politics makesme as scared as actor John Boyega appears to be in this still from the teaser trailer to Star Wars: Episode VII  The Force Awakens. (LucasFilm/Disney via Associated Press)  Its entirely possible that Ive watched this 20 or 30 times in the past week:  Like a lot of other Star Wars acolytes, the trailer was enlightening in that it proved that, despite his best efforts, George Lucass prequels could not extinguish my enthusiasm for events that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far way. The debutof the very cryptic trailer also has awakened a debate about whether this next trilogy will address political themes. My Washington Post colleague Alyssa Rosenberg began this debatewith a post expressing a new hope that director J.J. Abrams will tackle some political questions head-on: By venturing to a galaxy far, far away, the original Star Wars movies managed to shake looseof the allusions to contemporary politics that shape so many fantasy and science fiction movies today. Butif the most basic step in a heros journey  the decision to leave hometranslated to a dusty little foreign planet of George Lucass imagining, the most basic question of politicshow to have a better lifecan as well. And if J.J. Abrams wants to tell a story about the awakening of an old power and the victory of a new political movement over a sclerotic old system, it is an issuethat ought to inform his story and his new characters. Of course, the political wonk empire strikesback, as always. Over at Bloomberg, Jonathan Bernstein sounds a cautionary note:  Im not sure I agree about wanting more politics. Movies are almost always about individuals. Politics is often about institutions. Thats one reason Mr. Smithism  the idea that all it takes is for one honest person to stand up to corruption  is such a common way of portraying U.S. politics in the movies. Its easier than explaining how institutions work, or how opposing interests can lead to conflict even though neither is inherently right or wrong.  And over at the Washington Monthly, Seth Masket weighs in as well, suggesting that political themes haunt the franchise like a phantom menace:   [J]ust because [inserting political themes into moves] can be done doesnt mean it should be, particularly in a Star Wars film. Politics was never Lucas strength, and its not obvious from his previous work that J.J. Abrams has much interest in the subject. And thats just fine. His 2009 Star Trek reboot had almost no politics in it at all and was one of the better sci-fi films of the last decade, faithful to the old franchise but still charting out new territory. Into Darkness, however, attempted to address some darker political motivations within the Federation, and it was a complete mess. Theres certainly the potential for some interesting political observations in Episode VII. At least some significant remnants of the Empire clearly remain, for example; Im curious to know how they survived the Battle of Endor and what kind of control they exert within the galaxy. But Id be totally fine with little or no explicit political references in the coming films. My fellow bloggers and I will intuit them anyway.  I fear that I have to side with my fellow political scientists here, although there is a middle ground that might be possible between Rosenbergs hopes and Masket and Bernsteins fears. The latter two are correct that past correlations are not encouraging: The Star Wars films that focused more on politics were easily the worst ones in the franchise, and J.J. Abrams has a very poor track record when he concentrates on anything other than lensflares action-packed space opera. Furthermore, a real problem with Lucass prequels is that their narrative arc didnt really leave this galaxy. Revenge of the Sith was so easily viewed as an allegory for the Bush administrations exploitation of the war on terrorism that the number of similar commentaries on the subject made it seem like an attack of the clones. That said, only a vengeful Sith deals in absolutes, so maybe Rosenbergs hopes should not be dismissed entirely. To expand on her point, the one thing that both the original trilogy and the prequels have in common is the central narrative. In both trilogies, an obscure, powerless individual on an impoverished planet is suddenly thrust into the most important and pivotal political struggles of the galaxy. In their journeys, both Luke and Anakin are tempted by the Dark Side of power, andtheir ultimate choices lead to very different outcomes. If John Boyegas character represents that particular narrative arc, there are ways in which this next trilogy can address politics without getting bogged down in them. Thats a big if, however, for two reasons. First, Im worried about what the political landscape of this galaxy will look like 30 years after the return of the Jedi. The politics of the original trilogy were simple and gripping: a rebel movement opposing a totalitarian dictatorship. The politics of the prequels were more complex  at the expense of things like, you know, characterization. The new trailer suggests that the Imperial forces have not exactly disappeared, which means that the politics here probably will be about a Rebel Alliance facing growth pains as it tries to actually govern. Although the political scientist in me is intrigued by that narrative possibility , the sci-fi geek in me is petrified that these questions will bore the hell out of me while Im watching  or, worse, enrage me, like Anakin Skywalkers politicalpontificating. And we all know what happens when fear and anger enter into the political equation. Second, the stone-cold truth about Lucass Star Wars universe is that the politics of it are inherently elitist. The whole concept of the Jedi embraces an elitist, cartelistic view of power. Because the Force is awakening in this next movie, the Jediwill still be an ongoing political project in these films. And Im wary that they can be used to discuss any grand political themes that resonate in our own galaxy. So I hope that Rosenbergs aspirations are fulfilled  but I fear that our destiny as movie-watchers probably lies with Bernstein and Masket. What do you think?"

Dec. 4, 2014 Protesters march toward downtown Minneapolis on Interstate 35W a day after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict the New York police officer in the death of Eric Garner. Garner, a 43-year-old African American, was suspected of selling loose cigarettes in violation of tax laws. Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Star Tribune via AP  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.        By Karen Tumulty December 4 at 9:32 PM  Follow @ktumulty    Two events unfold in a strikingly similar way, just a week apart: After an unarmed African American man dies at the hands of a white police officer, a grand jury declines to bring that officer to trial. Protests ensue. But the political conversations surrounding the two cases have been very different. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., became an inkblot test illuminating the nations deeply rooted political and racial divides. The fatal use of a banned chokehold on Eric Garner, an asthmatic father of six and grandfather of two, in New York City seems to have had the opposite effect  bringing wide condemnation crossing racial, partisan and ideological lines. Conservatives have joined liberals in denouncing the Staten Island grand jurys decision Wednesday as a miscarriage of justice. Sean Davis, founder of the conservative Web magazine the Federalist, tweeted: The Eric Garner murder is pretty much slam-dunk second-degree manslaughter at the very least. But hey: Two Americas. On Ferguson, by contrast, Davis called the situation murky and muddled at best.     New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that those angry with the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer in the death Eric Garner should work for positive change. (Reuters)   And on Fox News, conservative Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer called the Staten Island grand jurys decision totally incomprehensible. It looks as if ... they might have indicted him on something like involuntary manslaughter at the very least, Krauthammer said. The guy actually said, I cant breathe, which ought to be a signal if the guy was unarmed, and the crime was as petty as they come. On July 17, officers approached Garner because they believed he was selling loose cigarettes  an evasion of taxes. His struggle with officer Daniel Pantaleo was captured on amateur video, leaving little doubt about the circumstances and the amount of force applied by police. In contrast, the Ferguson grand jury had to weigh conflicting versions of what occurred Aug. 9, with no similar documentary evidence. Whether any major policy changes result from either episode remains to be seen. Justice Department investigations are underway, with the one in New York being led by U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch, who is President Obamas nominee to replace Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. Obama has also set up a task force on policing and intends to promote the use of body cameras on officers, among other measures to encourage trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. On Thursday, Obama called New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) and discussed ways to repair relations between police and those they are supposed to protect. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said such tensions are not just a problem in New York or Ferguson but in far too many communities across the country. He said Obama and de Blasio pledged to work together to strengthen the trust and bond between law enforcement and the community they serve. A number of African American leaders have urged Obama to be more assertive in leading a national dialogue on the issue. Others say the scope of the initiative is too narrow.     One day after a New York grand jury declined to indict a police officer in the death of Eric Garner, President Obama said, ""Too many Americans feel deep unfairness"" in the criminal justice system. (WhiteHouse.gov)   Law professor Christopher Edley Jr., a former dean of the law school at the University of California at Berkeley, directed a government-wide review of affirmative action programs during Bill Clintons presidency. He argued that the solution must go beyond police practices to looking at the school systems, health-care policies and other programs that devalue minority lives. The very best chance for broadening the power of the moment is if the president leads us in that direction, beyond police behavior to those deeper challenges, Edley said. The responses that people are talking about are overly technocratic and ultimately will have little payoff without this shift in priorities. Many politicians of both parties were muted or silent amid the rioting that followed the St. Louis County grand jury decision in the Ferguson case. But as peaceful protests swelled after the decision in New York on Wednesday, a number of them stepped forward and said that more scrutiny should be given to both cases. Clearly both of these are serious tragedies that weve seen in our society, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said in response to a question at his weekly news conference. I think the American people want to understand more of what the facts were. There are a lot of unanswered questions that Americans have, and frankly I have. Boehner said he would not rule out holding congressional hearings into the cases and the questions they raise about police practices. At an appearance in Boston, where she had been scheduled to speak about womens issues, former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton  the presumed front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination  began by speaking about the cases in Ferguson and Staten Island. Clinton said the U.S. criminal justice system was out of balance, and she added: A lot of hearts are breaking, and we are asking ourselves: Arent these our sons? Arent these our brothers? In a late November poll by The Post and ABC News, public opinion overall was almost evenly split on the Ferguson case. The poll results contained some stark divisions: Blacks, other racial minorities and Democrats largely believed the grand jurys decision was a miscarriage of justice; most whites and Republicans sided with the police officer in the case, Darren Wilson. The Garner case is much clearer in terms of the facts of the case, said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. With Ferguson, there was a dispute on what happened between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson. We dont have access to adjudicate between all these conflicting testimonies, and so in many ways, it was almost as though conversations were being had past one another on Ferguson. But he added that those two cases, plus the fatal shooting in 2012 of Florida teen Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer, brought up many conversations within churches and within our denomination, about experiences that black Christians face that white Christians just dont. Some on the right also saw in the Garner case an argument against big government. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said part of the blame should fall on New York lawmakers for imposing a $5.85-a-pack tax on cigarettes, which invites black-market evasions. I do blame the politician, Paul said on MSNBCs Hardball. We put our police in a dangerous situation with bad laws.  Anne Gearan, Ed OKeefe and Abby Ohlheiser contributed to this report. "

Nine of their next 12 gamescome away from Verizon Center, starting Thursday night here at PNC Arena against the Carolina Hurricanes (8-13-3, 19 points).

Thats up to each of us to figure out on our own. I know Ive had some off nights and I go right back to the drawing board. You try to make it better. Thats all we can really do.

The Washington Post,L,Manila Mart in Beltsville caters to Pinoys and American fanboys alike - The Washington Post," By Tim Carman December 4 at 4:27 PM  Follow @timcarman    Non-Pinoys arent so fond of pancit palabok, the woman at Manila Mart told me as she prepared a fresh batch of the Filipino comfort food. They tend to recoil, like vampires, from all the garlic, she said.  Okay, she didnt drop the vampire reference, but she did emphasize the dish also includes smoked fish flakes called tinapa, which non-natives apparently fear more than death, clowns and Guy Fieris donkey sauce. Well, she didnt say anything about circus performers or equine-named gravies, either, but she did offer to prepare a sample, so I wouldnt waste my money and, by extension, her labors.    Pancit palabok, a pungent noodle dish with egg, shrimp, garlic and pork rinds served at Manila Mart. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  What she handed me was not a tiny Dixie-cup sample, but a decent-sized Styrofoam bowl that would have sold for $15 on 14th Street NW. Manila Marts pancit palabok starts with a tangle of rice noodles coated in a shrimp sauce, garnished with slices of hard-boiled egg, curls of cooked shrimp, scallions and a breadcrumb-like crust of tinapa, crushed pork rinds and fried garlic crumbles. The richness, the funk, the crunch, the pungency, the fishiness: Your palate wont know which way to turn. To prove that non-Pinoys can be fanboys of pancit palabok, I walked back to the prep area to show the employee my Styrofoam bowl, all but licked clean. So you like it? she asked. Not only do I like it, but pancit palabok has become the new romance in my life. Filipino food is enjoying a moment in Washington. Its been dragged from the shadows by such chefs as Katsuya Fukushima (whose izakaya brunch at Daikaya includes a sisig pork hash) and Cathal Armstrong (who features refined Pinoy dishes at Restaurant Eve as a nod to his Filipino-American wife and partner, Meshelle), as well as restaurateurs Nick Pimentel and Genevieve Villamora (whose recent Bad Saint pop-up had a  line of people waiting to try it).    Customers gather around Emma and Antonio Bioc's Filipino food at Manila Mart in Beltsville. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  But for every chef-driven Filipino plate, there must be three home-style Pinoy restaurants laboring in some suburban black hole without media scrutiny and the instant hipster cachet such attention generates. Take, for example, Manila Mart, which is crammed into a strip-center storefront in Beltsville with security bars covering its windows. The facade all but screams: Eat pavement and go elsewhere. Dont be fooled: Owned by Filipino natives Antonio and Emma Bioc, Manila Mart may lack atmosphere, but it radiates kindness. Their cafe, with its small clutch of tables, sits in back of the market. From Wednesday through Sunday, the Biocs and team prepare a rotating menu of Filipino favorites, some of which are not displayed on the steam table where all business is conducted. Emma and/or her daughter, Kate Magno, will happily explain every dish available that day, providing samples as needed to sate your curiosity, if not your appetite.    The steam table at Manila Mart in Beltsville. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  Its easy to understand why chefs have latched onto umami-rich Filipino cuisine. Its cooking borrows from cultures near and far, from China to Mexico, and its blunt flavors are as subtle as Imelda Marcoss shoe closet. Besides, Filipinos love pork more than David Chang and Sean Brock on a weekend bender in North Carolina. Start with Manila Marts pork skewers, which are marinated and grilled, the char darting in and around the sweet-soy flavors. The meats tenderness is derived from the same source as its sweetness: the Sprite in the marinade.    Barbecued pork skewers at Manila Mart in Beltsville. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  The skewers are available every day the cafe is open for business. Same for some other plates, including lechon kawali, a slab of boiled-and-fried pork belly, which sounds like a State Fair dare until you bite into it. The crackly exterior quickly gives way to a lush, fatty interior, as yielding as corn pudding. You will eat more than any doctor would advise. The simmered pork in the dinuguan may be an acquired taste: Known as chocolate meat, because of the porks cocoa-liquor-like sauce, the dish assaults the nostrils with its barnyard aromas and then moves to the palate with its minerally and sour flavors. Dinuguan owes its funkiness to such hardcore ingredients as pigs blood and palm vinegar.    Dinuguan, a traditional Filipino stew made with pigs blood and palm vinegar. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  Filipino cuisine, of course, is not an immutable, impermeable object, identical on every one of the 7,107 islands in the archipelago. Emma Bioc, for example, hails from the Bulacan province, famous for its sweets (some of which, such as puto, these tiny muffin-poppers split at the top and exploding with cheddar cheese, can be found pre-packaged on the counter). But she ventures into other areas, such as Bicol, a major Filipino coconut-producing region and the spiritual home of Bicol express, a stew of semi-spicy pork simmered in coconut milk. In Biocs hands, the dish expertly balances sweet with heat.  The sheer diversity of dishes at Manila Mart is jaw-dropping for such a small operation. The signature sourness in the tender beef steak, or bistek as its known in the Philippines, may taste like lemon juice, but its actually the liquid from the Filipino counterpart, this tart little orb called calamansi. The bone-in oxtail in the kare-kare luxuriates in a peanut sauce enriched with the drippings from that long-braised meat. The dense collardlike taro leaves in the house-made laing dish, another Bicol specialty, add a bitter, earthy element to the coconut milk infused with shrimp paste. And the slices of bitter melon in the ginisang ampalaya are no joke: Theyd curl the tongue of an amari-aholic.     Kare-kare, a dish of beef oxtail in a peanut stew, served at Manila Mart in Beltsville. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  But no matter what you order, heres the thing to remember about Manila Mart: The Biocs want to ease you into Filipino cooking. So they dial down the pungent and pepper qualities that may make non-Pinoys nervous, allowing diners to customize their meal at the table. It may be a courtesy to American customers, but it doesnt taste like a cheat to Filipino cooking.  MANILA MART 5023 Garrett Ave., Beltsville. 301-931-0086.

The Washington Post,L,The rules of engagement: How militarized police units enforce the law around the world - The Washington Post," By Nicole Crowder December 4 at 11:00 AM  Follow @nicolemcrowder      Members of Belgiums special forces at their headquarters in central Brussels. (Yves Herman/Reuters)  In 1993 the Justice Department installed the 1033 program as a way to help law enforcement agencies counter drug activities duringthe United States war on drugs. In 1997, the boundaries of law enforcement expanded after Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, grantingpolice and otheragencies the right to obtain weaponry for specific law enforcement purposes that would help in making arrests. Many U.S. police departments have since acquired surplus U.S. military hardware: armored vehicles, military-grade weaponry. According to Reuters, since 1996the DefenseDepartment has transferred $4.3 billion in military equipment to local and state police through the 1033 program. And after 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security allowedlocal law enforcement to inherit a surplus of military weaponry from wars abroad through federal funds to counter terrorism. The recent clashes between heavily armedlaw enforcementand protesters in the wake of a police officer killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown inFerguson, Mo., have reignited the discussion surrounding the militarization of American police forces. The rules of engagement for police or paramilitary forces abroad allows the use of lethal force using military-grade gear with relatively few restrictions. But with that is a code of conduct, a set of rules, that sharply regulates the wide latitude of law enforcement, and puts into a place a system of accountability. Human rights monitors say police in Belgium are legally entitled to use proportionate force, after a warning, where there is no other means to achieve a legitimate objective. Police may use firearms in self-defense, to confront armed perpetrators, or in defense of persons or key facilities, but never for crowd control. In Afghanistan, the police can use weapons or explosives against a group of people only if they it has  disturbed security by means of arms, and if the use of other means of force  has proved ineffective. And Afghan police are required to give no fewer than six warnings three verbal and three warning shots before using force in this situation. In India, the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are called on for violent disorder that the police are unable to contain. They require an on-the-spot magistrates consent and must issue a warning before each escalation of the use of force, from verbal warning to water cannon and tear gas, then to rubber bullets or baton rounds, and then to firearms. Britains law states that lethal or potentially lethal force should only be used when absolutely necessary in self-defense, or in the defense of others against the threat of death or serious injury. In Italy, police and the paramilitary Carabinieri follow the same guidelines, which say that the use of weapons is allowed only in the line of duty, when it is an unavoidable necessity to overcome resistance, stop violence or prevent a [serious] crime, and that the response must be proportionate to the situation.

The Washington Post,L,Why Apples in court over iPod software it stopped using in 2009 - The Washington Post," By Hayley Tsukayama December 4 at 10:59 AM  Follow @htsuka      Two iPod players circa 2009, when Apple stopped putting rights technology limitations on music. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)  Apple is embroiled in another trial this week, with lawyers spending time in a California courtroom debating whether or not the company was acting in an anticompetitive manner toward music player competitors such as RealNetworks between 2007 and 2009. Here's a primer on the basics of this case and what's at stake. It deals with allegedly anticompetitive behavior on the iPod.The case deals specifically with the way that Apple handled files on the iPod between 2006 and 2009. It's hard to overstate the impact that the success of the iPod had on Apple -- and the strategy that it set for every product the company has released since. The iPod represented the first time that Apple successfully linked hardware and software together by tying the iPod to the iTunes store. The iPod certainly wasn't the first MP3 player, but it did end up being the most successful inlarge part because it was hooked into a store that Apple completely controlled. For many years, users couldn't play songs they'd purchased on other music services on the iPod, and also couldn't play their Apple-purchased music on any non-iPod player. That's the technology being discussed here, though there have been no digital rights management limitations on Apple's music since 2009. But the case has been wending its way through the courts for a decade, and was finally given the go-ahead for trial earlier this year, as the San Jose Mercury News reported. Lawyers say Apple was crazed in its pursuit of market share.The latest accusation lobbed against Apple claims that the company actively erased music purchased from other sites when people updated their iPods. Lawyers arguing against Apple have pointed to this as evidence that Apple was determined to keep iPod users hooked only onits own service, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. That would also keep them coming back to the iPod when it was time to upgrade, since all of the music was locked to Apple's device. According to the Journal's report, attorney Patrick Coughlin said Apple decided to give users' ""the worst possible experience and blow up"" their music libraries in an effort to protect the contracts that Apple worked out with music labels to get music into the iTunes store. Apple says it was just really worried about hacking. Apple has said that the reason that it scrubbed competitors' music off of the iPod was for security. Apple attorney William Isaacson said that hackers had been trying to put files on the iPod that would help them figure out how to hack the system. Allowing software from RealNetworks and other competitors ""posed a danger to the consumer experience and to the quality of the product,"" Isaacson told the court, according to a report from Reuters. But company officials did say that they purposefully did not tell users that their non-iTunes music was disappearing. As the Journal reported,Apple security director Augustin Farrugia testified that Apple didn't want to ""give users too much information"" on how the software worked -- ostensibly to avoid user confusion. And videotaped testimony from 2011 starring Apple's late co-founder, Steve Jobs, does show that the executive wasn't afraid to play hardball with competitors. In the deposition, Reuters reported,Jobs asked if RealNetworks even still existed,in response to an opening question about whether he was familiar with the company. (They did then, and still do.) And, when asked if Apple's statement about RealNetworks's software sounded ""angry"" -- including a draft of a press release that likened the company's software to hacking -- Jobs said that a ""strong response from Apple would be a lawsuit."" There's a lot of money at stake...The class action is asking for $350 million in damages for a class of around 8 million people. If Apple loses the case, customers who bought iPods between Sept. 12, 2006, and March 31, 2009, may be eligible for a small payment. That's a lot of cash -- though maybe not quite as much for Apple, which made $8.5 billion in profits last quarter alone. Still, making big settlements is probably not a habit Apple would like to get into. The company has already agreed to pay up to $450 million to settle a class action over e-book pricing. Half a billion here, half a billion there, and those settlements can add up. ...but it's unlikely to change much, if anything,about Apple's current business.For one, even if a judge does find against Apple in this particular trial, the company has shown in the past that it's not at all hesitant about filing appeals. After all, Apple was found liable in a 2013 Justice Department suit for colluding with publishers to raise the price of e-books in 2013 -- a case the company has appealed and has said it will take all the way up to the Supreme Court, if it has to. And, apart from the fact that the technology in question here was phased out in 2009, it's also a fact that the iPod is much less important to Apple's overall business than it used be. In its latest earnings call, the company disclosed that sales were down 28 percent from the same period last year. Apple has also decided to report iPod sales in a category with Apple TV, accessory and Apple Watch sales from now on; the music players used to have their own category on the balance sheet."
The American Conservative,C,How Privilege Dies | The American Conservative,"Pondering the deeper meaning of Eric Garners killing, food blogger Nishta Mehra writes of her traumatic loss of innocence in the valley of the shadow of grad school:
For many years, I was accused of being a Pollyanna: optimistic to a fault. I grew up inside a lot of privilege, protected for many years from most of lifes truly awful things. Those things existed for me in a mainly theoretical way, in the way of a kid who read a lot, and empathized a lot, and cried a lot, but who didnt have much more than feelings at stake. I cared and despaired and I went about my life.
Much as I liked to think I wasnt nave, I certainly was. And Im probably not alone in saying that it was grad school that disabused me of my self-conception as a worldly and sophisticated person. I went straight from undergrad to an MFA program and quickly became awarewas made aware, by some brutally honest workshop critiquesof my tendency to wrap things up into nice, neat little bows: pat endings & pretty morals, easy answers and everythings going to be okay.
Dear God. It was even worse for one of Mehras fellow grad students, whose raw reaction to the brutally honest workshop critiques was captured on film.
Where would we be without MFA programs to smash the false consciousness of bourgeois privilege? As the Kitchen Krupskaya writes on her food blog about the distressing Garner news, I was planning to blog about turkey pot pie this week, but my God, who the f**k cares about turkey pot pie when we are living inside of, as my friend Mark put it, some kind of midnight?
Right. Some aggressive cops pile on to a fat guy in Staten Island, who dies, and the grand jury fails to indict him  and were in Darkness at Noon territory? What kind of grad school was that, anyway?
This cannot be improved upon.
But seriously, I dont blame Mehra for being upset with the Garner no true bill, especially because she and her partner have an adopted black son. A lot of people are upset about the Garner case. And theyre caring about pot pie too. People cared about pot pie in 1990, when New York had its all-time high murder rate: over 2,200. The city was worse than grad school, if you can imagine it. Here we are in 2014, nearly at the end of the year, and do you know how many murders there have been in the city of New York? 286.
Thats still 286 too many, granted, but its good thing Nishta Mehra was protected by that bubble of privilege in the 1970s-1990s, when the citys crime rate was through the roof. She would never have eaten turkey pot pie in this country again.
You will be happy to learn that Mehra talked her partner out of fleeing America:
Jill turned to me last night in bed and said I would say we should move, but I dont know where to. And I said, No, we have to stay. We have to stay and fight.
Its time for pot pie!
[Thanks to the reader who tipped me off.]
UPDATE: Unsurprisingly, some commentators are missing the point of this post. Its not to diminish peoples anger of Garners death, which is understandable. Nor is it to diminish the problem of police brutality, which is real. Its to marvel at the psychology of this kind of reaction from a privileged person (like, well, me). I would expect Mehra to be particularly upset about the Garner killing, given that she is parenting a black son. What blows me away is her lack of self-awareness in claiming that graduate school, one of the most privileged experiences an American can have, occasioned her awakening to the harshness of existence. Come on. And then to keen over not being able to make pot pie because Eric Garner is dead? This is not a post about Eric Garner, may he rest in peace; this is about the compulsion a certain sort of person has to catastrophize, and to appropriate other peoples tragedies so they can feel an exaggerated sense of drama.
You would actually take seriously the idea that you should flee America because of the Garner killing, as shocking as it was? Really? Last year, a white family who lives down the road from me was beaten at a gas station because, according to their black attacker, they were white and in the wrong neighborhood. It was a horrible crime, and a racist crime. Had I flipped out and said that this reminded me of the time I was in Paris and a mugger slugged me and took my wallet outside of the George V, and how that showed me that we will never live in a world that is just, you would have been justified in poking fun at me. And if my wife had said that crime against that local family just goes to show that we should put away the pie filling and crusts, and talk about fleeing America, and I said no, we must stay and fight for our country, well, I think you would have a moral obligation to poke fun at my hysteria, and to legitimately wonder why someone who lives with as much privilege as I have  and Mehra has  would be so undone by one violent act, as appalling as it may have been.
UPDATE.2:Mehras reaction reminded me of this scene from the black comedy Heathers, in which a grieving father of a football player whose murder (by Christian Slaters character) was staged to look like a gay murder-suicide, joins the communal hysteria surrounding the event by making an artificial gay-affirming speech at his sons casket. The point of the scene is not to make fun of death, or gay people, but at manufactured emotion and their display.
UPDATE.3:Heres the right-wing version of this. I once talked to an Iraq war veteran who told me that he hated people coming up to him in public, when he was in his fatigues stateside, looking at him deeply in the eyes, and saying, Thank you for your service. Why does that bother you? I asked. He said that he knows people mean well, and he feels bad for hating these moments, but he said he finally got the sense that many of these people want so badly to participate in the emotional experience of the war, and felt that by going overboard to empathize with soldiers they were trying to get kind of a contact high, an unearned experience. It was a complicated emotion this veteran had, but I understood what he meant. Its like that passage in All Quiet on the Western Front in which Paul, the protagonist, comes back to his village from the front, and all the older folks are sitting in the cafe cheering for him and telling him how wonderful he and the boys are for fighting, etc., and Paul finds it alienating. I think the emotion that Mehra and many non-black others have over what happened to Eric Garner is real, but theres also a false note in it, or so it seems to me.

The American Conservative,C,Fidelis Ad Mortem? | The American Conservative,"Please read Ross Douthat on the Eric Garner tragedy and the need for reform of Americas policing:

[I]ts worth returning, again, to a groupof data points that bear on these issues.The first is the overall crime rate, which (as many,though not enough, people know) has been falling since the 1990s, with homicide ratesbasically backto pre-1960s crime wave levels. The second is the level of mortal danger faced by policemen in the line of duty, which has been declining steadily since its most recent, 1970s-era peak; accordingto one estimate, American cops are less likely to be killed in the line of duty than at any point since the 1870s. The third is the rate at which civilians are killed by police officers, which has been  well, there the data gets extremely cloudy, becausewe dont have good official statisticson the subject. (Which is why collect better statistics reasonably topsa list of plausible reforms.) At the very least, though, weknow that the overall number of homicideshas dropped over the last decade, and the(again, problematic) statistics we do haveshow an increasein policemen killing civilians over the same period.
If you assume that a free society needs to strike a balance, needs to grant the police sufficient latitude to keep public order without granting them so much latitude that their powers are too easily abused, then these three numbers provide a decent heuristic for figuring out when the balance has tipped too far in one direction or the other. Ina landscape where cops are getting killed in large numbers and the overall crime rate is high basically the landscape of the 1970s its reasonable to assume that your police force needs, maybe desperately, more arms and tools and protections and numbers if its going to adequately do its job. . . .
But given a landscape like ours, where the police are clearlyquitewell armed, police work seems to have become (by historical standards) very safe, crime rates are still falling,andthe police seem to be dealing out death at an increasing rate  well, then you have a situation where generalizing to potential policy reforms from Eric Garners death, or other cases like it, makes a lot more immediate sense.

I dont tend to like discussing policy in terms of anecdote. Eric Garners is a high-profile case that pushes a whole lot of buttons. I have my own opinions about the case based on what Ive seen and read  this Daily News editorial sums them up well  but my opinions of this one case dont matter that much, really, because I dont know about the thousands of cases of alleged police excessive force that arent so high profile. Some of those look like Eric Garners. Many dont.
Thats the reason for policy to be governed by the data. And the data strongly suggest that our society is out of balance in its prioritization of the safety of the police, and the protection of their prerogatives to maintain order, versus the safety of citizens who come into contact with police.
On that subject, heresFrank Serpico:
I remember a guy I worked with back in the 81st Precinct, an ex-Marine named Murphy. He would not turn out for roll call until his shoes were spit-shined, and his uniform was creased.
One night, he was called to a family dispute. There was a man waiting behind the door, and he came out with a butcher knife and slashed Murphys face.
Murphy could have emptied his gun in him. Instead, he disarmed the man and put him in cuffs. Whats happening today in the performance of some officers can only be described as sheer cowardice. They dont belong in the uniform, and they shouldnt have weapons  whether theyre cops or not.
I hear cops saying all the time  and theyre proud of it  shoot first, ask questions later.
They say, Its my job to get home safe. Yes, but not at the cost of a human beingwho never posed a threat to you in the first place.
Note that the last link is to an article about Akai Gurley, an innocent black man shot to death by a jumpy cop  who was also black. The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter highlights the racial aspects of these questions, and I dont mean to belittle that aspect by saying that another way of slicing the question is to say that #SuspectsLivesMatter  which is what columns like this one appear to miss. They matter because they may be innocent, and they matter because even if they are guilty, they are human beings.
Yes, we have reason to worry about how excessive deference to the police facilitates outright abuse- but we have reason to act even if we assume absolute good faith on the part of the cops (as the Staten Island grand jury plainly did). We have reason even if you could prove that changing the way police approach suspects results in an uptick in the number of police injured or killed on the job, even if you could prove that there would be an uptick in crime generally.
Theres no guarantee that you could prove that  stop and frisk has declined dramatically in New York, and street crime continues to fall  but even if you could prove it, that wouldnt end the discussion.Because there is also value to the protection of the suspects well-being, and we cant just ignore that value. It has to be weighed in the balance. And the data suggests that, right now, we are very out of balance.

The American Conservative,C,Rolling Stone Rolls Off Cliff | The American Conservative,"
Rolling Stone magazine apologizes for the UVA rape story. Excerpt:
In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies inJackies account, and we have come to the conclusion thatour trust in her was misplaced.We were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account. We are taking this seriously and apologize to anyone who was affected by the story.
If they were taking this seriously, heads would roll at that magazine. It is staggering that they made such a huge and damaging story rest on the word of a single person, whose point of view they agreed not to subject to questioning. They allowed their cultural politics to take priority over a search for the truth.
Think of the damage to the University of Virginias reputation, and to the accused fraternity! I regret too that I suppressed my own initial questions about the journalistic practices in the reporting of the Jackie story. Kudos again to reader Ryan Booth for calling B.S. on this story from the very beginning.
From the Washington Posts latest report on the unraveling scandal:
Earlier this week, Jackie revealed to friends for the first time the full name of her alleged attacker, a name she had never disclosed to anyone. But after looking into that persons background, the group that had been among her closest supporters quickly began to raise suspicions about her account. The friends determined that the student that Jackie had named was not a member of Phi Kappa Psi and that other details about his background did not match up with information Jackie had disclosed earlier about her perpetrator.
The Post determined that the student Jackie named is not a member of Phi Kappa Psi.
Emily Renda was a U-Va. senior when she first met Jackie in the fall of 2013. In an interview, Renda said she immediately connected with Jackie as they discussed the bond they shared as rape survivors. Renda said she was raped her freshman year after attending a fraternity party.
Jackie told The Post that she bawled as she spoke to Renda about her own sexual assault.
Renda said Thursday that Jackie initially told her that she was attacked by five students at Phi Kappa Psi on Sept. 28, 2012. Renda said that she learned months later that Jackie had changed the number of attackers from five to seven.
An advocate is not supposed to be an investigator, a judge or an adjudicator, said Renda, a 2014 graduate who works for the university as a sexual violence awareness specialist. But as details emerge that cast doubt on Jackies account, Renda said, I dont even know what I believe at this point.
Rolling Stones reporting and editing was so reckless, and the consequences so damaging, that I dont see how the magazine can avoid paying a massive libel settlement to the university and to the fraternity.
So, where do the University of Virginia and Phi Kappa Psi fraternity go to get their reputations back?
Finally, this from a UVA professor:
My more libertarian-leaning friends were right to express concerns about the RS story, and I was wrong to give it credence.
 W Bradford Wilcox (@WilcoxNMP) December 5, 2014

But as a faculty member @UVA & an alum (92), I can attest to the reality of sexual assault here, a reality that still needs to be addressed

The American Conservative,C,The Catos of Old Media | The American Conservative,"
Dylan Byers has a list of which New Republic editors quit this morning rather than submit to the new Chris Hughes regime. It was an absolute bloodbath:
Those who resigned are senior editors Jonathan Cohn, Isaac Chotiner, Julia Ioffe, John Judis,Adam Kirsch, Alec MacGillis,Noam Scheiber, Judith Shulevitz and Jason Zengerle; executive editors Rachel Morris and Greg Veis; digital media editor Hillary Kelly (who resigned from her honeymoon in Africa); legal affairs editor Jeffrey Rosen; and poetry editor Henri Cole and dance editor Jennifer Homans. Contributing editors Anne Applebaum, Paul Berman, Jonathan Chait, William Deresiewicz, TA Frank, Ruth Franklin, Jack Goldsmith,Anthony Grafton, David Grann,David Greenberg,Robert Kagan, Enrique Krauze,Damon Linker,Ryan Lizza, John McWhorter,Sacha Z. Scoblic, Cass Sunstein,Alan Taylor,Helen Vendler and Sean Wilentz.
Many of those who resigned on Friday believe that Hughes and Vidra now intend to turn TNR into a click-focused digital media company, at the expense of the magazines strong editorial traditions and venerable brand, according to sources who attended the gathering at Foers house.
The narrative youre going to see Chris and Guy put out there is that I and the rest of my colleagues who quit today were dinosaurs, who think that the Internet is scary and that Buzzfeed is a slur. Dont believe them, Julia Ioffe, one of the resigning senior editors, wrote in a Facebook post. The staff at TNR has always been faithful to the magazines founding mission to experiment, and nowhere have I been so encouraged to do so. There was no opposition in the editorial ranks to expanding TNRs web presence, to innovating digitally. Many were even board for going monthly. Were not afraid of change. We have always embraced it.
Heres the masthead, pre-resignation.Of the twelve senior editors, only Brian Beutler, Evgeny Morozov, and Rebecca Traister remain. Both executive editors are gone. The digital media editor is gone, but most of the editors who actually put out the magazine seem to still be in place. (Senior editor is a title that usually means someone in the first rank of staff writers, though depending on the culture and structure of the magazine, it could also involve some editing).
Given the state of the media profession today, it takes real moral courage to resign a journalism job on principle. Contributing editors arent paid much, if at all, but senior editors and other staffers depended on their TNR paycheck to pay bills. And they gave that up as a matter of principle, even though they live in one of the most expensive cities in the country, and have dim immediate prospects for finding a new job in this declining industry. These men and women have my deep respect.
I dont judge those who have remained behind, precisely because it is so difficult to find a job elsewhere. I expect at least some of them will resign later, if they can put together a plan for supporting themselves after they quit. Maybe others will remain, not because they necessarily agree with the Hughes/Vidra vision for the magazine, but because they need that job. How Gabriel Snyder, the incoming editor, manages to put out a magazine with such a traumatized staff is beyond me. Whats more, all of these writers are well networked in Washington media and political circles. The Hughes TNR is going to be radioactive. I think Gabriel Snyder is walking into one of the worst jobs in elite journalism. Its like being appointed manager of a hotel in Sarajevo right after the shooting stopped.
UPDATE: Former TNR editor Andrew Sullivan has some remarks well worth reading. Excerpt:
And isnt there a place for just that  for a group of writers and thinkers to put out a publication that doesnt seek to maximize pageviews or generate profits, but which dares to believe it has something to say, a point of view to fight over, and just gets on with it and hopes for the best? That was the formula we followed in the decade I worked there as editor and before. If you build it, they will come  and when I left it, we had over 100,000 subscribers. It didnt matter that it wasnt a million, or even 105,000. They were the right 100,000  and built a shared community of ideas and a heritage to fight over. Thats whats missing in this era of pageviews and clickbait and sponsored content: a self-confident team that, at some level, doesnt give a shit what others or even readers believe, as long as the debate itself is rigorous, fair, open and reasoned. I remember Michael Lewis throwing back his head and giving that barking laugh of his as he marveled: The is the first magazine Ive ever been a part of that never asks what its readers want. Where is that kind of publication now?
Yes, the era in which a handful of magazines were the effective gate-keepers for an entire national conversation is gone  and that is a good thing for the discourse and for the democracy. But only if what TNR did can be replicated in the new era.
More, on how the new media start-ups, for all thats good about them, dont do what old media warhorses like TNR did:
Do you get any sense from Vox that its editors are actually struggling to figure out the world, that there are battle-lines over policy and politics, that high culture and low culture are critical complements to a nothing-but-politics-and-policy view of the world? Say what you like about Marty Peretz  but there was more diversity of thought in one issue of TNR than there has been in one year of Vox. Thats what Ill miss. Along with the contrarian refusal to go along with the latest left-liberal fad, or to cover for Democrats in office, for fear of giving the other side ammunition.
Amen to all that. But here are three related points that are hard for people like Andrew and me (and you, maybe) to take:
1. There is no way to be that kind of magazine today and make money. Maybe there never was. Some rich guy owner, or collection of rich guys (donors), are going to have to subsidize these magazines. You have to hope for a wealthy owner, or wealthy donors, who see themselves as stewards of certain principles, which includes encouraging debate and discussion  I mean, what Andrew Sullivan calls struggling to figure out the world, as distinct from having the world all figured out, and telling it what to think about itself.
If I won the Powerball, I would sink a fortune into The American Conservative, but I would not want it to be a mouthpiece for my views, nor would I want it to become a magazine that lays down a party line. I would be pleased to spend my fortune making it into a lively magazine that sees the world generally from the perspective of the traditionalist right (as opposed to the neoconservative right), with some libertarian leanings as well. Im not much of a libertarian, as you know, but some of the most interesting and important thinking is coming from libertarians. My point is simply that struggling to figure out the world is a vital mission, one worth supporting even if some of the answers the strugglers come up with are wrong. I would not want to fund a magazine that gives pre-fabricated conservative answers to the worlds problems; I would want to fund a magazine that asks conservative questions, and thinks about them in a conservative way.
2. Because we are mostly a bunch of romantics, journalists and writers have a huge blind spot to the money side of running publications. Andrew is right: not having to care what your readers thought about you gives writers and editors a lot of freedom, and they can use it in admirable ways. But if thats your attitude, you had better have a sugar daddy to subsidize your losses. Andrew is running a very lean operation, and so far he seems to be doing well. But his is an opinion and aggregation site, and thats something that can be done cheaply. His site, like this blog, is a free rider on the investment other media outlets make in reporting and in-depth essays. Im not saying thats a bad thing (and by the way, Im a paid subscriber of Andrews site), but I am saying that we writers look down on the bean-counter side of running publications, as if it contaminated our sacred labors. The money to pay the salaries of writers and editors doesnt come from a pot of leprechaun gold.
3. We also tend to ideologize these matters in a way thats unhelpful to clear thinking. When I was at the Dallas Morning News in the past decade, the few conservatives at the paper were often astonished by how the newsroom, in what it chose to cover and the way it chose to cover it, seemed to go out of its way to offend the kind of people who actually subscribed to the paper (older north Dallas and Collin County suburban Republicans, mostly). I would argue, in a friendly way, with liberal colleagues over this, but all the time I would be thinking, If we empathized more with our actual customers, and reported more on the things that concern them, and were more fair and representative to their views, we wouldnt be losing so many subscribers.
As the decade wore on, though, I came to disbelieve that diagnosis. Our subscription losses were on par with the subscription losses of most other newspapers in the US. You could say that the DMN was too liberal for Dallas, and you could make a good case for that. But could you say that the Boston Globe,which also suffered steep circulation declines, wastoo liberal for Boston? The shift away from print media is not mostly about ideology, though a lot of people like to think so.
So when people like Freddie de Boer, a true leftist, sneer from a left-wing perspective at the demise of TNR, I understand where hes coming from and dont begrudge him his opinion. But I think he shouldnt be quite so confident, because the same dynamic thats brought TNR down threatens all small magazines of opinion in this country. I would be surprised if any of us could pay our bills on subscriptions and ad sales alone. We depend on the generosity of donors  many of them wealthy and public-spirited  who believe that the work we do is important, even if it is not money-making.
Somebody said yesterday that TNR doesnt need a better business model, it needs a better owner. Yes, exactly. I dont know how many rich people are willing to subsidize a money-losing journalistic operation out of principle and for the common good, but we sure need to find them.

The American Conservative,C,Shakeup at TNR | The American Conservative,"I would like to say that Im shaken by the dramatic shake-up just announced atThe New Republic, which sees Franklin Foer and Leon Wieseltier leaving the  well, I was going to say the magazine, but it isnt a magazine anymore apparently, but rather a digital media company, whatever that is.TNR, after all, was the magazine that introduced me to public intellectual life. I read it in the school library in high school  no, actually, I devoured it. It was clever, but also serious  political, but also literary. And, in the 1980s and 1990s, it was hard to imagine a magazine having more influence on the shape of debate. The first iteration of my politics were substantially shaped by its sensibility.
But I dont miss that sensibility. Theres a hairs-breadth of difference between the classicTNRsensibility that I grew up with, the sensibility that Leon Wieseltier embodied so well, and the sensibility I encountered in the posthumous Irving Kristol collection,The Neoconservative Persuasion.That sensibility, as you can tell from my review, positively gives me hives these days. (And by the way,Im not even talking about foreign policy.)
I dont want to sound peevish. If you ask me to mournTNRs passing, I can do that, and in style. But I have a feeling that a lot of otherTNR lovers are going to indulge in nostalgia, and tell sad tales about the death of the public intellectual. And Im just not going to indulge that way.
I can wish, honestly, that I had more hope for whatTNRis about to become. I dont have much. Chris Hughes sounds like hes trying to make TNR into something without much of a distinctive sensibility at all. I would have liked to see whatTNR would have become with a fierce but critical young radical at the helm, someone who would recall the magazines younger years.Thats not what it has been for a very long time, and its not what it sounds like its going to be in its next incarnation.
But if its not going to be that, I still dont want it to be what it was in the 1980s and 1990s. That time is gone. Chris Hughes seems determined to follow the extant media trends into the future. Id prefer to seeTNR lead than follow, but the future is where it has to go, one way or another.
And maybe that fierce but critical young radical deserves a magazine of her own to found.

The American Conservative,C,Racist Copsor Liberal Slander? | The American Conservative,"We have found the new normal in America.
If you are truly outraged by some action of police, prosecutors, grand juries, or courts, you can shut down the heart of a great city.Thursday night, thousands of protesters disrupted the annual Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, conducted a lie-in in Grand Central, blocked Times Square, and shut down the West Side Highway that scores of thousands of New Yorkers use to get home.
That the rights of hundreds of thousands of visitors and New Yorkers were trampled upon by these self-righteous protesters did not prevent their being gushed over by TV commentators.
Watching cable, I saw one anguished man cry out from a blocked car that he was trying to get his sick dog to the vet. But his rights were inferior to the rights of protesters to block traffic, chant slogans, and vent their moral outrage to TV cameras.
From New York to Washington to Oakland, crowds acted in solidarity to block main arteries at rush hour.Has President Obama condemned this? Has Eric Holder?
Remarkable. Underlings of Gov. Chris Christie have been under investigation for a year for closing off lanes to the George Washington Bridge. Contrast liberal indignation at Christie, with liberal indulgence of the lawbreaking Thursday night, and you will see what people mean when they talk of a moral double-standard.
What were these protests about? A grand jury on Staten Island voted not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner last July. As the video that has gone global shows, Pantaleo sought to arrest Garner, a 65, 350-pound man arrested many times before.
What was Garner doing?
Selling cigarettes one by one on a main street, a public nuisance for the stores and shops in front of which he plied his trade, but not a felony, and surely not a capital offense. A misdemeanor at most.
As Garner backed away and brushed aside attempts to handcuff him, Pantaleo grabbed him from behind by the neck to pull him down, as other cops swarmed in.Repeatedly, Garner cried, I cant breathe! On the ground he again cried, I cant breathe! And he died there on the sidewalk.
Undeniably, terrible and tragic. Undeniably, not a natural death. And, undeniably, the way Garner was brought down and sat upon, an arm around his neck, contributed to, if it did not cause, his death.
Yet Garner did not die by strangulation. According to the city medical examiner, he died from the compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.The cops were holding him down by sitting on him.
As Rep. Peter King said Thursday, If [Garner] had not had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese, he would not have died. The Washington Post reports that the medical examiner seemed to confirm this, describing Garners asthma and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors.
Why would a Staten Island grand jury not indict Pantaleo for murder or manslaughter in the death of Eric Garner?In a word, intent.Did Pantaleo intend to kill Eric Garner when he arrived on the scene? Did Pantaleo arrive intent on injuring Eric Garner? No and no.
Pantaleo was there to arrest Garner, and if he resisted, to subdue him and then arrest him. That was his job.Did he use a chokehold, which the NYPD bans, or a takedown method taught at the police academy, as his lawyer contends?That is for the NYPD to decide. The grand jury, viewing the video, decided that the way Pantaleo brought down Garner was not done with any criminal intent to kill or injure him, but to arrest him.
Garners death, they decided, was accidental, caused by Pantaleo and the other NYPD cops who did not intend his injury or death, with Garners asthma and heart disease as contributing factors.Now that grand jury decision may be wrong, but does it justify wild allegations of racist cops getting away with murder?
This reflexive rush to judgment happens again and again.
We were told Trayvon Martin was shot to death by a white vigilante for walking while black, and learned that Trayvon, when shot, had been beating a neighborhood watch guy nearly unconscious, martial arts style, while sitting on top of him.
We were told that Ferguson cop Darren Wilson gunned down an unarmed black teenager for walking in the street, and learned that Michael Brown just robbed a convenience store, attacked Wilson in his patrol car, and was shot trying to wrestle away the officers gun.
Liberals are imprisoned by a great myththat America is a land where black boys and men are stalked by racist white cops, and alert and brave liberals must prevent even more police atrocities.
They live in a world of the mind.
The reality: As of 2007, black-on-white violent crime was nearly 40 times as common as the reverse. But liberals cant give up their myth, for it sustains their pretensions to moral superiority. It defines who they are.

The American Conservative,C,Five Myths That Keep America in the Middle East | The American Conservative,"Iraq no longer exists. My young friend M, sipping a cappuccino, is deadly serious. We are sitting in a scruffy restaurant across the street from the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Manhattans Upper West Side. Its been years since weve last seen each another. It may be years before our paths cross again. As if to drive his point home, M repeats himself: Iraq just doesnt exist.
His is an opinion grounded in experience.As an enlisted soldier, he completed two Iraq tours, serving as a member of a rifle company, before and during the famous Petraeus surge.After separating from the Army, he went on to graduate school where he is now writing a dissertation on insurgencies.Choosing the American war in Iraq as one of his cases, M has returned there to continue his research.Indeed, he was heading back again that very evening.As a researcher, his perch provides him with an excellent vantage point for taking stock of the ongoing crisis, now that the Islamic State, or IS, has made it impossible for Americans to sustain the pretense that the Iraq War ever ended.
Few in Washington would endorse Ms assertion, of course.Inside the Beltway, policymakers, politicians, and pundits take Iraqs existence for granted.Many can even locate it on a map.They also take for granted the proposition that it is incumbent upon the United States to preserve that existence. ToparaphraseChris Hedges, for a certain group of Americans, Iraq is the cause that gives life meaning. For the military-industrial complex, itsthe giftthat keeps on giving.
Considered from this perspective, the Iraqi government actually governs, the Iraqi army is a nationally representative fighting force, and the Iraqi people genuinely see themselves as constituting a community with a shared past and an imaginable future.
Arguably, each of these propositions once contained a modicum of truth.But when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 and, as then-Secretary of State Colin Powell predicted,brokethe place, any merit they previously possessed quickly dissipated.Years of effort by American occupiers intent on creating a new Iraq out of the ruins of the old produced little of value and next to nothing that has lasted. Yet even today, in Washington the conviction persists that trying harder might somehow turn things around. Certainly, that conviction informs the renewed U.S. military intervention prompted by the rise of IS.
So when David Ignatius, a well-informed and normally sober columnist for theWashington Post, reflects on what the United States must do to get Iraq War 3.0 right, he offers this mental checklist: in Baghdad, the U.S. should foster a cleaner, less sectarian government; to ensure security, we will have to rebuild the military; and to end internal factionalism, were going to have to find ways to win Kurdish support and rebuild trust with Sunnis.Ignatius does not pretend that any of this will be easy. He merely argues that it must beand by implication can bedone. Unlike my friend M, Ignatius clings to the fantasy that Iraq is or ought to be politically viable, militarily capable, and socially cohesive. But surely this qualifies as wishful thinking.
The value of Ms insightof, that is, otherwise intelligent people purporting to believe in things that dont existcan be applied well beyond American assumptions about Iraq. A similar inclination to fanaticize permeates, and thereby warps, U.S. policies throughout much of the Greater Middle East.Consider the following claims, each of which in Washington circles has attained quasi-canonical status.
* The presence of U.S. forces in the Islamic world contributes to regional stability and enhances American influence.
* The Persian Gulf constitutes a vital U.S. national security interest.
* Egypt and Saudi Arabia are valued and valuable American allies.
* The interests of the United States and Israel align.
* Terrorism poses an existential threat that the United States must defeat.
For decades now, the first four of these assertions have formed the foundation of U.S. policy in the Middle East. The events of 9/11 added the fifth, without in any way prompting a reconsideration of the first four. On each of these matters, no senior U.S. official (or anyone aspiring to a position of influence) will dare say otherwise, at least not on the record.
Yet subjected to even casual scrutiny, none of the five will stand up.To take them at face value is the equivalent of believing in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairyor that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell really, really hope that the Obama administration and the upcoming Republican-controlled Congress can find grounds to cooperate.
Lets examine all five, one at a time.
The Presence of U.S. Forces:Ever since the U.S. intervention in Lebanon that culminated in the Beirut bombing of October 1983, introducing American troops into predominantly Muslim countries has seldom contributed to stability. On more than a few occasions, doing so has produced just the opposite effect.
Iraq and Afghanistan provide mournful examples. Thenew bookWhy We Lost by retired Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger finally makes it permissible in official circles to declare those wars the failures that they have been. Even granting, for the sake of argument, that U.S. nation-building efforts were as pure and honorable as successive presidents portrayed them, the results have been more corrosive than constructive.The IS militants plaguing Iraq find their counterpart in thesoaring productionof opium that plagues Afghanistan. This qualifies as stability?
And these are hardly the only examples. Stationing U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia after Operation Desert Storm was supposed to have a reassuring effect.Instead, it produced the debacle of the devastatingKhobar Towersbombing. Sending G.I.s into Somalia back in 1992 was supposed to demonstrate American humanitarian concern for poor, starving Muslims.Instead, it culminated in the embarrassing Mogadishu firefight, which gained the sobriquet Black Hawk Down, and doomed that mission.
Even so, the pretense that positioning American soldiers in some Middle East hotspot will bring calm to troubled waters survives.Its far more accurate to say that doing so provides our adversaries with what soldiers call a target-rich environmentwith Americans as the targets.
The Importance of the Persian Gulf:Although U.S. interests in the Gulf may once have qualified as vital, the changing global energy picture has rendered that view obsolete.Whats probably bad news for the environment is good news in terms of creating strategic options for the United States. New technologies have once again made the United States the worlds largest producer ofoil.The U.S. is also the worlds largest producer ofnatural gas. It turns out that the lunatics chanting drill, baby, drill were right after all.Or perhaps its frack, baby, frack.Regardless, the assumed energy dependence and vital interests that inspired Jimmy Carter to declare back in 1980 that the Gulf is worth fighting for no longer pertain.
Access to Gulf oil remains critically important to some countries, but surely not to the United States. When it comes to propping up the wasteful and profligate American way of life, Texas andNorth Dakotaoutrank Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in terms of importance.Rather than worrying about Iraqi oil production, Washington would be better served ensuring the safety and well-being of Canada, with its bountiful supplies of shale oil.And if militarists ever find the itch to increase U.S. oil reserves becoming irresistible, they would be better advised to invade Venezuela than to pick a fight with Iran.
Does the Persian Gulf require policing from the outside? Maybe. But if so, lets volunteer China for the job. It will keep them out of mischief.
Arab Allies: Its time to reclassify the U.S. relationship with both Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Categorizing these two important Arab states as allies is surely misleading. Neither one shares the values to which Washington professes to attach such great importance.
For decades, Saudi Arabia, Planet Earths closest equivalent to an absolute monarchy, has promoted anti-Western radical jihadismand not without effect. The relevant numbers here are two that most New Yorkers will remember:15out of 19.If a conspiracy consisting almost entirely of Russians had succeeded in killing several thousand Americans, would U.S. authorities give the Kremlin a pass? Would U.S.-Russian relations remain unaffected?The questions answer themselves.
Meanwhile, after a brief dalliance with democracy, Egypt has once again become what it was before: a corrupt, oppressive military dictatorship unworthy of thebillionsof dollars of military assistance that Washingtonprovidesfrom one year to the next.
Israel:The United States and Israel share more than a few interests in common. A commitment to a two-state solution to the Palestinian problem does not number among them.On that issue, Washingtons and Tel Avivs purposes diverge widely. In all likelihood, they areirreconcilable.
For the government of Israel, viewing security concerns as paramount, an acceptable Palestinian state will be the equivalent of an Arab Bantustan, basically defenseless, enjoying limited sovereignty, and possessing limited minimum economical potential. Continuing Israeli encroachments on the occupied territories, undertaken in the teeth ofAmerican objections, make this self-evident.
It is, of course, entirely the prerogativeand indeed the obligationof the Israeli government to advance the well being of its citizens. U.S. officials have a similar obligation: they are called upon to act on behalf of Americans. And that means refusing to serve as Israels enablers when that country takes actions that are contrary to U.S. interests.
The peace process is a fiction. Why should the United States persist in pretending otherwise? Its demeaning.
Terrorism: Like crime and communicable diseases, terrorism will always be with us.In the face of an outbreak of it, prompt, effective action to reduce the danger permits normal life to continue. Wisdom lies in striking a balance between the actually existing threat and exertions undertaken to deal with that threat. Grown-ups understand this. They dont expect a crime rate of zero in American cities. They dont expect all people to enjoy perfect health all of the time. The standard they seek is tolerable.
That terrorism threatens Americans is no doubt the case, especially when they venture into the Greater Middle East. But aspirations to eliminate terrorism belong in the same category as campaigns to end illiteracy or homelessness: its okay to aim high, but dont be surprised when the results achieved fall short.
Eliminating terrorism is a chimera. Its not going to happen. U.S. civilian and military leaders should summon the honesty to acknowledge this.
My friend M has put his finger on a problem that is much larger than he grasps. Heres hoping that when he gets his degree he lands an academic job.Its certain hell never find employment in our nations capital.As a soldier-turned-scholar, M inhabits what one of George W.

The American Conservative,C,Canadas Patriot Act Moment | The American Conservative,"When the United States Senate refused to consider reforms to its surveillance state last week, it voted under a cloud of ominous warnings from former spy directors and soon-to-be Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about ISIS and the specter of domestic radicalization. At the same time, Canada is publicly processing the aftermath of an actual act of domestic terror and drumming up its own climate of fear in order to expand its surveillance powers.
Its always uncomfortable for a country to ask why when a member of its own citizenry decides to commit acts of political violence against his/her state. Its uncomfortable because the act of answering such a query is the political equivalent of looking in the mirror. Its unsettling to see ones own blemishes reflected back, and much easier to avoid the ordeal altogether. But as political claims about radicalization are being used to justify significant public policies, it is important to have an accurate understanding of the mechanisms at work.
Canada is going through this disquieting process right now after a gunman named Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed a Canadian soldier in Ottawa last month before shooting up Parliament. He was eventually gunned down, but the city was thrown into a state of panic, with the Prime Minister hiding momentarily inside a broom closet. The shooting was the most prominent episode of domestic terrorism for Canada since the FLQ days of 1970.
Debate over the nature of the attack ensued immediately after the perpetrators identity was revealed. The pundits zeroed in on how the country ought to deal with homegrown terrorism and pontificated endlessly on radicalization and Islamic terrorism. This is not a new debate for Canada or the West in general. The Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS), has put radicalization as one of its top priorities for years, as have the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper.
It didnt take the Conservative government long to announce that new security measures are going to be introduced. These new provisions are supposed to bolster Canadas security state by giving law enforcement and intelligence agencies more tools to do their jobs. The moment of vulnerability and panic was obviously there for the taking, and the Stephen Harper administration exploited the opening. It has paid off, for now, as the Tories shorten the gap in the polls between them and the Trudeau-led Liberal Party in advance of next years general election.
The Harper administrations emphasis on extra surveillance will play itself out legislatively in the coming months, but it has already begun by introducing a bill to allow Canadas spy agency, CSIS, to broaden its scope of operations. The bill gives CSIS the opportunity to spy abroad or to tap other agencies to collect the data of Canadians abroad, and also proposes giving CSIS informants/sources more anonymity, something that will certainly affect the due process of law in Canada. This bill is just the beginning of what is likely to be a wave of anti-terror legislation to be introduced in the coming months.
Many of those who participate in such debates have tried to ask the why question, and a few have come to the conclusion that its Canadas increasingly interventionist and jingoistic posture toward the Muslim world that prompts domestic terrorism. In this view, Canadas participation in the War on Terror, and the Harper administrations over-the-top support for Israel has antagonized the Muslim world, which now sees a once peace-making Canada as an enabler of oppressive politics. Some then take matters into their own hands.
Of course, most do not choose to engage in acts of political violence to express their dissatisfaction with Canadian (or American, or European, etc.) foreign policy, and homegrown terrorism has killed a relatively small amount of people in Canada since, say, 9/11, as compared to more banal dangers like drunk driving or the flu. Furthermore, studies done out of the U.S. conclude that radicalization is decreasing over time, which, logically, should be mirrored by a decrease in surveillance. But thats just wishful thinking.
The Tories security-heavy rhetoric is simple to understand, as it cuts the world into black and white, while not doing much to differentiate between violent Muslims and average ones. In fact, many have voiced their concern that Harper has not taken the time to condemn the anti-Muslim backlash that has resulted from last months incident. This has created an atmosphere where the national conversation on terrorism often conflates the Islamic faith with violence. The coalescing of this conceptual trope has raised serious concerns over the antagonizing of the Muslim community, which will certainly be a major target for increased policing and spying.
This doesnt bode well for Canadians at all if security is the top priority. For though the actual socio-psychological process of radicalization still isnt well-understood, experts like political scientist Robert Pape have suggested that Western occupations and interventions do indeed play a role in prompting the process. However, its not the only factor that leads a person down the path of political violence. Anger at Western policies in the Muslim world and elsewhere provides a cognitive opening that primes an individual to be exploited by radical rhetoric. Former Obama advisor Dalia Mogahed, who led Gallups effort to survey the Muslim world, also refers to this idea when talking about extremism.
Stating that the invasion of Afghanistan or Canadas diplomatic support for Israeli is fully to blame for Muslim terrorism isnt totally correct. But saying that such policies have absolutely zero relationship with rage against the West is probably even more misleading. Policies that antagonize the Muslim world are often necessary catalysts for a person to become open to the process of radicalization, but are not sufficient in-and-of-itself to result in acts of political/ideological violence.
In other words, a person needs to be open to the process of radicalization first before he or she can be truly radicalized, and to commit violence. This opening can be prompted by many factors, which is why each individual case is so different, depending on the persons life circumstances. Anger at Western policy/crimes, social alienation, poverty, and mental illness all seem to play a role at one point or another for these individuals. Once theyre in a condition to be open to radical rhetoric, an encounter with, say, online propaganda or an extremist preacher can have serious effects. This is why study after study, like last years publication on radicalization co-produced by The Soufan Group (an international intelligence and risk consultancy) emphasizes the local nature of radicalization. It is a local problem that needs local solutions. This means that the federal government needs to incorporate within its national security strategy local groups that can bring troubled individuals into the communal fold.
The bewildering thing is that the intelligence community in Canada understands this. In a 2010 study of radicalization obtained by the Globe and Mail, CSIS concludes that violent radicals about to enact violence usually operate on the margins of their communities. They cant be found simply by spying on mosques or by policing mainstream communities. The best way to defang them is to empower local communities to keep an eye on each other and to talk sense into the few troubled men or women among them. Simply giving law enforcement more ways to spy and police certain communities will lead to alienation.
Nonetheless, its probably safe to say that partnering with Canadian Muslims (on anything) isnt high up on Harpers to-do list. Its much easier to capitalize off of the fear of Canadians by presenting them with the Muslim or immigrant bogeyman, who will impose his will on Canada (or America, or Europe) unless stopped by national security. This is an old game, and certainly not exclusive to Canadian politics. The politics of division, be it in Canada or the U.S., are useful when nearing an electionespecially if done well.
The Harper Tories do it very, very well. Over the past few years, the government has assumed an antagonistic posture toward many of the Muslim communitys most prominent institutions. In a time of economic uncertainty, the best way to galvanize a political base is through fear. The Tories, just like Republicans or hawkish Democrats, are always well positioned to do this. Cultivate a base with fear, and fear can always be used to poke it to life when times are tough.
Of course, none of this politicking is meant to make the citizenry safer. In fact, it may lead to the exact opposite result, as it plays right into the rhetorical narratives peddled by extremists who love to push around the idea that the Christian West will not rest unless it conquers Islam itself, and every Muslim along with it. In other words, antagonism will create more antagonism, and more angry Muslims isnt a good thing for public safety.
As Canada approaches its next elections, and the United States starts to look forward to its own, domestic radicalization is likely to continue to be trotted out as a political tool to justify expansions and protections of each countrys respective surveillance state and interventionism. That rhetoric and those policies will continue to diverge from the actual best practices for keeping their countries safe.

The American Conservative,C,Civil Liberties Lose a Champion | The American Conservative,"The irony of Sen. Mark Udalls stunning defeat to Republican Cory Gardner in this years midterm election is that he lost, in part, because of his association with a significantly unpopular president.
In reality, he was never a likely real stand-in for the president or the Democratic caricatures painted by the GOP. A western state mountaineer and self-described libertarian who supported concealed carry permits alongside a womans reproductive rights, this Colorado Democrat wasnt your typical limousine liberal.
But come January he will be gone, leaving behind a canyon-sized void that civil liberties advocates say will be difficult to surmount.
To be blunt, hes leaving very big shoes to fill, said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has worked with Udall for over a decade.When I think of his work over the last several years, he was really only joined by (Oregon Senator Ron) Wyden and a few others since the early days, asking the hard questions, she added.
He was one of the few who were willing to cross examine and take issue with any statement that was posited by the national security establishment  things they would prefer not to be questioned about, said Tom Drake, a whistleblower and privacy activist who has plenty of experience battering the doors of Congress to force transparency on the governments classified surveillance programs.
It doesnt take much opposition to get opposition  all you need is a check, he said, noting that Democrats Udall and Wyden, who both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, provided that check for years.We are going to lose one of the key voices in the committee that is supposed to have oversight.
Republicans saw Udall, 64, as an easy target for a Senate majority takeover in a midterm election that became more about President Barack Obama and his policies than anything elseand it worked. Taking up the challenge, Udall by pundits accounts, flubbed the campaign by focusing too heavily on whether Gardner opposed reproductive rights for women and not enough on other issues.
A cruel-fated end, his supporters say, to a career spent being the type of elected official most Americans say they want in poll after pollsomeone who works for them, and not necessarily for party dominance or parochial allegiances. He may have had a D after his name, but particularly on the issue of constitutional rights and liberties, Udall was a champion of every American.
Mark Udall has been a real leader on these issues, and hes not someone who can be easily replaced, his old compatriot Wyden told TAC in a statement.
Udall has not only been on the forefront of privacy issues, but his independent streak has extended to voting against the war in Iraq and against the 2012 Defense Authorization Act, which critics say would have allowed for the indefinite detention of Americans. Advocates now want him to read the classified CIA torture report, the release of which has been delayed by the White House and CIA, into the congressional record before he leaves office at the end of the month.
Airing the 6,000 page final report for the first time would be his boldest move yet. His office told TAC this week that the senator is considering all options, and is currently in talks with the White House to get the report released before it gets to that point. News late Thursday suggested a summary of the report might be released early next week.
Udall declined to be interviewed for this story, but e-mailed some of his thoughts about his work in the Senate.At the heart of freedom is the freedom to be left alone. Thats why Ive been a steadfast advocate of Americans privacy rights and worked to rein in the National Security Agencys overreach, he said.Our intelligence community should focus on combating terrorists, not collecting the private phone records of millions of law-abiding Americans when there is no compelling national security interest to do so.
Udall served 10 years in the House before winning a six-year term in the Senate in 2008. He drew his first line in the sand by voting against the Patriot Act in October 2001. It overwhelmingly passed, but he was one of 62 Democrats and 66 members total in the House to vote against it. Anyone who was working in Washington in those emotionally charged weeks after 9/11 knows that was a bold stand to take.
I dont care about the politics, its bad policy, he reportedly said to Democratic consultant Steve Welchert at the time. Mark turned out to be right, Welchert recalled later to The Denver Post. That was an understatement.
More recently, as a senator, he voted again against extending several provisions of the Patriot Act, chiding his fellow Democrats for a lack of debate. For years he and Wyden had been banging their heads against the wall to get federal law enforcement to disclose just how they were interpreting the laws. As members of the Intelligence Committee they know things most Americans dont, and they expressed frustration that secret interpretations of the law had allowed the government to run roughshod over the constitution while calling it a matter of national security in order to keep it all secret.
We believe most Americans would be stunned to learn the details of how these secret court opinions have interpreted section 215 of the Patriot Act, Udall and Wyden wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder in March 2012 after the Justice Department sought the dismissal of two lawsuits by the ACLU and The New York Times. The suits endeavored to disclose how 215 (the provision that allows the feds who go after any tangible thing they say is related to a terrorism investigation without a warrant) was being used by law enforcement.
As we see it there is a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows, they wrote. This is a problem because it is impossible to have an informed public debate about what the law should say when the public does not know what its government thinks the law says.
The two senatorswho are among the very few privy to the classified interpretationswent on to make some damning assertions, not only about over-classification, but they also suggested the government was misusing the national security card in order to obfuscate the truth. We have grown increasingly skeptical about the actual value of the intelligence collection operation this has come as a surprise to both of us, as we were initially inclined the take the executive branchs assertions about the importance of this operation at face value.
In the summer of 2013, Udall called for the Patriot Act to be opened up and reformed. This time, he didnt just have his own evidence about government abuses gleaned from classified briefings, but the whole of Edward Snowdens leaks from that June. He and Wyden found common cause with Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) to push for reforms at the National Security Agency, which we know now has been using FISA to dragnet millions of Americans personal data and phone records without warrant.
Its time to end the dragnet  and to affirm that we can keep our nation secure without trampling on and abandoning Americans constitutional rights, Udall, Wyden, and Paul wrote in a June 2013 op-ed.
Jesselyn Radack is a federal whistleblower and attorney whose clients include Edward Snowden. Like Drake, she has emerged as one of Washingtons toughest privacy advocates.Radack told TAC that after the Snowden leaks rocked Capitol Hill, Udall went straight to work, conducting aggressive oversight of the NSAs surveillance programs, she said. At a time when the majority of the congressional intelligence committees are unable or unwilling to properly oversee the surveillance state, Senator Udall stands out as a member dedicated to informing the public and protecting civil liberties, she added.
He wasnt just talking about the NSA only when it was cool to talk about the NSA, added the ACLUs Guliani. He was talking about these issues for a long time and continues to talk about them.
But Snowden gave Udall and Wyden a chance to grill people like Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan, with headline-grabbing and illuminating results. After a cross-examining from Wyden, Clapper told the Intelligence Committee that the NSA was not gathering millions of Americans phone records without warrantcontradicting to the evidence right in front of the committee. Clapper was forced to apologize.
Meanwhile, the senators have doggedly quizzed other administration officials about the NSAs role in collecting massive amounts of data under Section 702 of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act (which Udall also opposed). This tool has allowed NSA to dragnet and keep massive amounts of data without warrant even if its useless to any investigation. Two previously secret programsPRISM and Upstreamwere revealed in the Snowden leaks.
The Washington Post reported in June that ordinary Internet users far outnumbered actual terrorism-related suspects among those swept up in these programs, and more than half of the tens of thousands of surveillance files reporters were able to analyze came from American citizensnot foreignersranging from their emails to photographs to academic transcripts and medical records.
Marcy Wheeler, a privacy policy expert and scribe behind the popular Empty Wheel blog, points out that Udall is also on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and from that perch was able to question Vice Admiral Mike Rogers, who was nominated (and confirmed) to head U.S. Cyber Command/NSA this year. In much the same fashion as Wyden did with Clapper, Udall asked Rogers to say whether the NSA was conducting warrantless surveillance on Americans through Section 702. Rogers declined to answer.
SASC was the only venue to ask Admiral Mike Rogers any questions before he was confirmed. Udalltried to use Rogers confirmationto get him on the record on back door searches, Wheeler recalled to TAC.
I also think hes good at finding places where the government isnt meeting the spirit of the law, she added, pointing to the growing concerns about NSA data collection under Executive Order 12333, which is also secret and warrantless. She said Udall used the February confirmation hearing for John Carlin to Assistant Attorney General for National Security to press his points, and to show just how transparent these agencies want to be with the people. Turns outnot much.
However, said Guliani, I feel that we are much further along with the debate than we were before thanks in part to Senators Udall and Wyden.
In July, Udall called for CIA head John Brennan to resign after the agency was forced to admit it spied on Senate Intelligence Committee staff computers while the CIA torture report was being pulled together. Brennan was forced to apologize.
Supporters hope Udall will read the torture report into the record if the White House continues to delay. Certainly, said Drake, it would be his last great stand as the independent senator.
Theres been way too much cover-up and collusion and too much year after year of keeping critical matters of state from public view, he said. He is in a unique position to do this.

When the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court recites lyrics from a rap song about violence and murder, you can bet he's not rehearsing for a shot on ""Saturday Night Live."" He's inquiring into the redeeming value of the crude and coarsened language of social media in the age of the digital.Chief Justice John Roberts quoted the lyrics of rapper Eminem's popular rap about a man who killed his ex-wife and described the murder to their young daughter, whose help he seeks in getting rid of mommy's body: ""Da-Da, make a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake.""The justice, like every inquiring mind that wants to know, asks whether such graphic language by a rapper embroiled in a custody fight with his ex-wife could be interpreted as a real-life threat.""Could that be prosecuted?"" he asked the lawyer for one Anthony Elonis, whose client had been sentenced to 44 months in prison in violation of a federal law making it a crime to communicate ""a threat to injure another person"" through interstate commerce, i.e., the Internet. Elonis had created a fictional narrative about his estranged wife's ""murder,"" which a jury determined made a ""reasonable person"" fearful.If Eminem's lyrics were created to entertain, so then were those of Mr. Elonis, his lawyer replied: The difference was in the reaction to them rather than the intent, and both should be protected speech.What the Supreme Court has to figure out now are the legal distinctions, if any, between Eminem's brand of entertainment and the argument of Anthony Elonis that he is an aspiring rapper whose angry rap on Facebook about the wife who left him is merely artistic creativity. Not only that, the words were ""therapeutic"" for him, not threats aimed at her.A sample of the Elonis' Facebook ""therapy"" makes it a tough call: ""There's one way to love ya but a thousand ways to kill ya. I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts."" Perhaps attempting a touch of the literary, he writes about smothering her with a pillow, as if emulating Shakespeare's Othello.The court is thus asked to believe such violent rants are harmless creative stories, merely salve for the wounds to an angry husband's psyche, balm for the hurt feelings of an aspiring star.Whether Mr. Elonis regards himself as Eminem or the Bard, his estranged wife testified that she was terrified for herself and her children and felt she was verbally ""stalked."" After a lower court sent her husband a ""protection from abuse"" order, her fear increased when he asked, in a verbal post, whether the court order, if neatly folded in her pocket, would stop a bullet. It's not difficult for the untutored layman to nod in agreement with Justice Samuel Alito's observation that calling this art ""sounds like a road map for threatening a spouse and getting away with it."" Such a finding would require juries to become pop music critics, and even mind readers, to figure out a defendant's psychological intent.Nevertheless, the First Amendment is the gold standard inscribed in the Constitution to protect speech, not just responsible speech -- but speech. We must not tolerate chilling speech. The question to ask is when does outrageous become dangerous, the irresponsible cry of fire shouted in a crowded theater. Where does rant end and criminal intent begin? Does the posturing of a rapper insulate his words with the First Amendment?The Internet poses new questions because teenagers ventilate verbally with violent images that are commonplace in the rap culture. They can sound like threats. Teenagers target adolescent ""enemies,"" and their real and imagined victims include peers, schools and, as in the protests in Ferguson, the police. Rappers like Eminem can be clever with words, but they're not exactly models for imitation.Against the backdrop of the verbal violence of videogame chat rooms, it's difficult to distinguish ""true threats"" from empty exaggeration of adolescents who are loud but actually carry no stick. One teenager in a chat room has been charged with threatening to shoot up a kindergarten, and we're foolish to ignore all such threats, as schoolhouse violence has demonstrated.The argument is difficult enough to puzzle eminent judicial minds. Should the basis for criminal activity be, as prosecutors argue, that a ""reasonable person"" must feel threatened, or as defense lawyers argue, the threatener must ""intend"" to create fear in a targeted victim. The Internet has in many ways become the trashcan of an indulgent culture, and obscene and misogynist language in much of rap poisons us all, particularly the minds and imaginations of the rising generation, threatening their perceptions of the world around them. That's the real chill.

What Should Conservatives Do? Just Say No.

One of the pleasant byproducts of writing books on Ronald Reagan including about his historic campaigns of 1976 and 1980 (with 1968 and 1984 forthcoming) is you often get asked Who  is the next Reagan? or What should conservatives do? when it comes to 2016.First, none of us can peer into the future. Only a few saw Reagans potential for greatness in the 1960s and 1970s and even after the election of 1980, many in the political classes thought he would be just another failed president following LBJ, Nixon and Jimmy Carter.Indeed, the only man uniformly thought would be a great president before he became president was George Washington. Only a handfulthought Lincoln, FDR, or Reagan would be great presidents before they were great presidents.Having said that, I doubt there is another Reagan in the GOP field for 2016. There is scant evidence that many really think about things. Most are following their consultants scripts to run personality campaigns rather than idea campaigns. Gingrich tried running an idea campaign in 2012 and look at what Romneys consultants did to him in Iowa.Thats the bad news. The good news is the problems of the country dont require a great president, just someone to clean up the messes created by President Obama and his ilk. America could use a Jefferson but can make do with a janitor.Many in the Tea Party and the conservative movement have advocated getting behind one candidate now, fearful of a Jeb Bush or another Establishment candidate winning the 2016 nomination, as in the case of Mitt Romney, John McCain and Bushs brother and father, and then leaving the party and conservatism for dead.Its fine in theory but there are a number of problems with this approach including being taken advantage of by the consultants around said candidate. If all conservative leaders decided to get behind Candidate A before the primaries, the first thing their consultants will do is move their candidate and his campaign to the middle, following the wrongful advice of Richard Nixon.Just ask President McCain and President Romney about moving to the middle in general elections.In fact, it would be advantageous for the 2016 GOP nominee to continue to run as a conservative populist outsider and reformer, just as Reagan did in 1980. The majority of the country remains right of center and the many failures of Obama and American collectivism can make 2016 a great teachable moment on why liberalism may be a crime and is certainly failureby design.The same principles of conservatism which work in primaries are no different than those which can work in a general election, if properly explained and properly understood.On the eve of the national election of 1980, Reagan went on television to give a half hour address, rich with American conservative thought, centered on the individual. Since her beginning America has held fast to this hope of divine providenceIt is true that world peace is jeopardized by those who view man not as a noble being, but as an accident of nature, without soul, and important only to the extent he can serve an all-powerful state.This is the fundamental basis of American conservatism: a God-inspired free individual.  Reagan was using primary campaign language in a general election, something thought impossible.It is because of these principles that no candidate right now is worthy of uniform conservative support. There are some good people running but they havent earned it. Conservatives should act as a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. They should applaud and admonish as the need calls for it. Those candidates who probably can never earn broad conservative support are Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush. Chris Christie is on the bubble for many on the right. The others must be made to come to conservatives.Conservatives should date all the candidates but not commit to one. Go to the dance, go to dinner, let them walk you to the door stoop, but dont invite them in for a drink and certainly dont go to bed with them. Conservatives should be willing to slap their suitors across the face and tell them to go home and sober up. Dont play they insiders game; thats the game played by the corporatists and consultants and Big Media. Play the outsiders game, one beyond the reach (and comprehension) of the mainstream media and the Washington Establishment.More importantly, conservatives should use their power and authority to both applaud and attack when any of the candidates say or do the right thing---and the wrong thing.At some point, a conservative or conservatives will emerge as the main challenger to the Establishment candidate and then a decision will be needed. But for the time being, conservatives should remember it is they and their ideas which are ultimately more important to the country than any one candidate seeking their support.

Declining Affordability in the Sales Mix of New Homes
Political  Calculations | Dec 05, 2014













Share on Facebook













 SHARES




















Earlier this week, we noted that the preliminary data for both the median sale price and the average sale price of all new homes sold in the U.S. appeared to spike dramatically upward to reach all time record levels for the month of October 2014.Today, we're digging deeper into the U.S. Census Bureau's data to get some insight into how the sales mix of the new home market in the U.S. is evolving. Here, we've calculated the twelve month trailing average of the monthly number new homes sold in the U.S. according to the price range into which they fall, which we've illustrated in our first chart.In this chart, we see that since the year-long main inflation phase of the second U.S. housing bubble ended in July 2013, U.S. new home builders have continued to increasingly turned away from producing affordable homes.For the lowest priced homes, below $150,000, that continues a trend that resumed with the onset of the second U.S. housing bubble in July 2012. We also find that builders have also begun to reduce the number of homes in the next-highest price tier, $150,000 to $199,999, since the main inflation phase of the second U.S. housing bubble ended in July 2013.Meanwhile, we find that the number of homes in the next higher price tier, $200,000 to $299,999 has flatlined since July 2013. And then we find that U.S. home builders have increased their monthly production of homes priced $300,000 and up.What this means is that U.S. home builders are increasingly declining to pursue building homes that fall within the affordable reach of U.S. households. That strategic decision mirrors what happened during the first U.S. housing bubble, when a similar dynamic increasingly took hold in the new home market after May 2004, setting up what would ultimately become the deflation phase of the first U.S. housing bubble.Our next chart stacks the data presented in the first chart to illustrate how the overall market looks.In this chart, we see that the combination of the increase in the number of $300,000 and higher priced homes with the decrease in the number of new homes sold for less than $300,000 has resulted in essentially flat production rates, with essentially sluggish growth, at best, for the industry.Our next chart visualizes the relative share of new homes sold in each of the price tiers tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau.As with the first U.S. housing bubble, we see that the sales mix of the current housing market has once again become considerably skewed toward the high end of the market. We see that new homes priced $300,000 or more now claim about 40% of all sales, up roughly 10% from the level recorded in July 2013.That's quite a dramatic change in such a short period of time. In fact, this kind of change in the sales mix of new homes should be considered to be a characteristic of a bubble in the new home market. Speaking of which, we should also note that what determines if a housing bubble exists is the rate at which prices change with respect to household income - comparisons of the current price level or quantity of homes built with those recorded during previous peaks or troughs do not matter in that determination.In our final chart, we'll show the relationship between the trailing twelve month averages of the median sale price of new homes in the U.S. against the median annual income of U.S. households.In October 2014, we find that U.S. median new home sale prices have risen to be about 40% higher than what would have been considered to have been affordable for same median household income between 1987 and 1999. Or for that matter, between 1967 and 1999.And so, we see declining affordability in the sales mix of new homes.Data SourcesSentier Research. Household Income Trends: July 2014. [PDF Document]. Accessed 3 September 2014. [Note: We have converted all the older inflation-adjusted values presented in this source to be in terms of their original, nominal values (a.k.a. ""current U.S. dollars"") for use in our charts, which means that we have a true apples-to-apples basis for pairing this data with the median new home sale price data reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. We are also using a novel approach to estimate the median income of U.S. households for the months of August 2014 through October 2014, since changes in the U.S. Census Bureau's survey methodology during this time have prevented Sentier Research from updating their monthly estimates of U.S. median household income.]U.S. Census Bureau.

Evaluating Conservative Attacks On The Garner Grand Jury

Like most people across the political spectrum, I approach the Eric Garner arrest video with the requisite amount of dread.  What a shame.  What a tragedy.  What an unsettling thing to see a man on the day of his death, a premature end following a few moments of conflict with New York City police officers.   Like many conservatives, I have just spent several days standing up for the Ferguson grand jury as it relied on actual evidence to reach a decision in the case of Michael Brown.  Those of us who took that stand weathered the attacks of unhinged factions who relied on virtually anything but facts as they fueled a false narrative of a Gentle Giant blown away by a racist white police officer.  Amid hopes that cooler heads will prevail as Ferguson fades in the rear view, along comes another non-indictment in the case of a black suspect dying after an interlude with a white officer.  I braced for more reflex cries of racism, more shenanigans from race-baiters, more protesters taking to the streets driven by the baseless narrative that white cops are itching to kill black folk.  All of these unfolded on cue.  What I did not expect is a cry of disagreement from conservatives against the New York grand jury, a burst of emotion as undeserved as the venom leveled against Ferguson jurors.  The Michael Brown and Eric Garner deaths are quite different.  One involved a violent criminal shot while attacking a police officer, a case whose particulars are clear even without video.  The other involves famously watched and re-watched video that nonetheless yielded differences of opinion.  The debate over Garner seems principled and thoughtful, containing several key questions: Did this arrest need to grow so heated so fast? Did those officers use too much force?  Did their restraint of him rise to the level of criminality?   These were some of the many matters processed by the citizens of the grand jury, and their ultimate decision was that no crime was committed in the attempted arrest of Eric Garner.  I expected pushback from Al Sharpton and Van Jones.  I did not expect it from conservative voices at Fox News.  Charles Krauthammer, a steadfast voice usually driven by razor-sharp clarity, found the grand jurys decision incomprehensible.  Judge Andrew Napolitano said this is not a fair application of the law.  Bill OReilly did not go into full wail at the non-indictment, but did share that he was extremely troubled.  A perusal of their complaints reveals an unfortunate and hopefully momentary surrender of logic to emotion, a trait all three had spent the previous week criticizing in others.  Im not immune to the power of the Garner video.  I wish I could jump into a time machine and prevent the whole sad thing from happening.  I would not go back to the point of the takedown, however.  I would go back farther to counsel Mr. Garner on the ill wisdom of resisting arrest or maybe back even farther, to offer suggestions against breaking the law in the first place.  But while we cannot jump back in time, we most surely can put aside our visceral reactions to the video in order to put ourselves in the shoes of the grand jurors.  They were not asked whether the video upset them.  They were not asked if the events were disturbing to watch.  They were not asked whether the arrest went flawlessly.  They were asked whether Officer Daniel Pantaleo broke the law in the dispatch of his duties.  Their answer was no.  If they had chosen to indict, I would have respected their decision.  Unlike Ferguson, the Garner case presents a wide  swath of reasonable options.  The decision not to indict is surely well within that range, and deserves to be spared criticism from people who are following some other drumbeat.  Krauthammer advocated an involuntary manslaughter charge at the very least, tapping into two facts that are entirely irrelevant: The guy was unarmed and the crime was as petty as they come.  Excuse me?  This cries out for another Charles  Barkley in this instance to sit down and explain to one of Americas top thinkers what was at issue here. When the cops are trying to arrest you, if you fight back, things go wrong, the NBA legend told CNN this week.  That is why Mr. Garner is dead.  His lack of a sidearm and the absurdity of the law he broke are of no consequence in a case of an enormous man with vast health problems choosing to fight police making a lawful arrest.  Napolitano also obsessed on the admittedly stupid law Garner broke, calling the arrest a use of deadly force on a person who posed no serious or material threat to the police.  Wow.  Dont let Barkley go just yet, he needs to spend some time with Judge Nap as well.  Someone surely needs to, so that this learned no-nonsense judge can refamiliarize himself with the meaning of deadly force.  A force is not deadly if you expire in large part due to your own self-created fragile health.  While the medical examiner ruled that Garner died as a result of the restraint used against him, the findings also noted that his condition was a vital factor.  He was unable to keep his job with the city Parks Department due to his inability to walk even short distances.  And the notion of Garner posing a threat is a straw man argument beneath a wise jurist.  No one argues that Garner put the officers lives at risk.  They responded as they did because a sizable suspect was refusing to cooperate.  Period.  Amid this wayward chorus, we should thank OReilly for not piling on to grand jurors who evaluated evidence as thoughtfully as their Ferguson counterparts.  But Bill did join the wave of reactions based not on police procedure but on gut reaction to the video.  Upon seeing the video that you just saw, and hearing Mr. Garner say he could not breathe, I was extremely troubled.  I would have loosened my grip.  I desperately wish the officer would have done that.  Bad spin there, Bill.  The most basic police training teaches that suspects will say or do anything to avoid being taken into custody.  I cant breathe, Youre hurting me and other laments are foisted on arresting officers all over America every day.  Officers must rely on applying force within the law and within police department rules, not relenting every time a suspect complains of discomfort.  Police training requires decisive and often aggressive action when resistance arises.  Hesitation can be fatal.   He didnt deserve that, OReilly concluded, and on that point he is right.  But this is another departure from what grand juries actually consider.  This grand jury was not even called to evaluate the so-called choke hold, a matter not of law but of department policy.  Even if that hold was used and that is debated it would expose Officer Pantaleo to professional sanction, not criminal prosecution.  In order to indict, the grand jury would have had to find reckless disregard for Garners safety, a fair expectation that the officers knew he could die, and perhaps even a callous disregard for that danger.  Finally, they would have had to find that the death was more attributable to police action than to Garners regrettable health.  The grand jury would have had to reach these conclusions not from feelings in the pit of their stomachs but from a clear-eyed expectation that such claims could be asserted in court beyond a reasonable doubt.  In their sincere judgment, that bar was not met.  That is a judgment that deserves respect, even if it is in the form of respectful disagreement.   I do not want for one moment to adopt the suspicion harbored by some, that conservatives chastened by battles over Ferguson are feeling a responsibility clamor for an indictment in the Garner case in order to assert some ill-defined bona fides for even-handedness. I would never assert this about the three gentlemen mentioned here, whom I respect profoundly.But their reactions are not sprung from the proper place for evaluating grand jury actions, in this case or any other.  If we are going to lecture people about wandering away from the facts and the law in controversial arrest cases, we had best not take side trips ourselves.

Requiring Calorie Counts on Menu Probably Won't Make People Healthier

One of the highly-touted (and contested) parts of the Affordable Care Act was that all chain restaurants would have to provide calorie counts on their menus. Now, new studies have shown that this requirement is having little-to-no impact on the food choices made by consumersbut the FDA is continuing to expand the program anyhow.
From Huffington Post:
But extra information may not translate into healthier choices, experts say. With a few exceptions, the overwhelming majority of the research finds that diners dont eat less when restaurants post the number of calories in their meals, according to David Just, a Cornell professor who has researched how portion labeling influences food choice. 
People who make dining decisions based on calorie counts already have a pretty good sense of how many calories are in a Big Mac or burrito, Just noted. And most diners who head to a restaurant chain go for a specific item and rarely look at the menu anyway, said Maeve Webster, a senior director at DataSsential, a company that studies food trends. If customers don't look at the menu, they won't see how many calories are in that serving of french fries.
""It will be a very rare case where a restaurant will full-on lose customers by putting calorie counts up there, Webster said. 



Shocker: people who want to eat hamburgers with grilled cheese sandwiches as buns will continue to eat them, regardless of the calorie count.
Adding calorie counts to a menu should be up to the discretion of the restaurant, not mandated by law. If a chain would like to project a healthier image, they have every right to release the information, and the opposite of this statement is also true. Consumers also have the choice where to eatand I doubt most dieters will be frequenting restaurants with calorie-dense food. There's also the issue of chains like Dominoes, who are forced to display full nutritional information in the restaurantdespite being primarily a delivery service. These costs certainly add up for the average restaurant owner, and if these studies are true, restaurants are spending all of this money for something that is effectively worthless.

So Charles Barkley is the latest in a line of public figures to come under fire from the Liberal media for calling the Ferguson rioters scumbags. Not the protestors, the rioters who looted and burned approximately 20 buildings in Ferguson crippling small businesses and causing unknown financial damages. I do not want to diminish Mr. Barkleys characterization of the rioters because I have made a similar characterizations myself, but the interview in its entirety spoke to a thoughtful and reasoned approach to his opinion on the Ferguson verdict and strong feelings about black culture and issues within the black community. Did anyone who did not take the time to listen to the video hear those thoughtful perspectives? His comments fly directly in the face of the narrative of victimization, oppression and racial tension that is so critical to keeping the racist meme alive.  In fact in Huffington Post's livecoverage of the interview, Mr. Barkley was characterized as siding with law enforcement in the Ferguson matter. This type of polarizing theme is critically important to the mainstream media (MSM), comprised of the major news networks. They have made victims of, glorified, and coddled these scumbags because they fit into the far Lefts storyline. Looters, arsonists and scumbags were easily manipulated into rage on a stage for the whole world to see. The MSM kept up the narrative by minimizing or eliminating facts that did not fit into the networks political narrative. Anyone who saw the abrupt and awkward transition made by Andrea Mitchell on ""Meet the Press"" this past Sunday just to keep from discussing relevant physical evidence can clearly see how important this continued narrative of racial strife and division is to the media. Meanwhile Conservative activists on social media are raising funds to help the business owners rebuild. I wonder how much MSNBC and Salon have donated to the same?  I truly believe America's Black community wants change but largely fails to encourage change in the most need areas.... that is from within. As long as the media continues to polarize the black community around issues like Ferguson, meaningful dialogue is not possible. We need to talk about the number of young black men who die violently at the hands of other young black men. We need to talk about the destruction of the black nuclear family and the problems fatherless families have created in our communities. We need to talk about the black culture in our poorest cities that discourages academic achievement and good choices. Any number of successful black writers and commentators are bringing up these topics, but we only get play around media circuses like Ferguson and we are only brought on for a sound byte. Nothing gets fixed with a sound byte.  As long as a significant number of Black Americans choose to embracing the misguided attitude that openly discussing our shortcomings is somehow taboo we will continue living under an unnecessary sentence of permanent victim status. Promotion of this groupthink mentality, coupled with the Lefts ability to control the media narrative closes the door on real and productive conversation. This mindset also keeps people like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and other like-minded leaders in positions of prominence while it does nothing for our community as a whole and prevents us from ever truly embracing our potential.  So, is anybody listening? For those who call me ""Uncle Tom"" and worse, please know it is that type of criticism that fuels my desire to continue on the path I have chosen. I do not hate being Black. I believe Black people are capable of far more than we have allowed ourselves to embrace on a large, visible scale.I am as proud of who I am as any person who takes pride in their identity and cultural heritage. As long as I remain a witness to the black community being manipulated by the media and those with political aspirations into excusing their failures and learned dependence, I will continue to try and start the discussion in vocal and provocative ways.   So are you listening? I agree with all six plus minutes of Charles Barkleys interview. Are you brave enough to hear what to say?

Obama Sues Companies for Complying with Obamacare

Whats the easiest way to avoid getting sued by the Obama Administration? Well If you come up with an answer, let the rest of us know. A company that has supported the President and his Affordable Care Act, is currently being sued by Obama for following the law. (Wait Affordable Care Act? Can we sue Democrats for false advertising yet?) Welcome to Obamas America. Where you can literally get sued for trying to comply with the law. (Boy Thatll teach you.) Honeywell International Inc., and two smaller firms, are being sued for taking advantage of a specific provision in the ACA that allows them to lower their out-of-pocket medical expenses.Deroy Murdock at the National Review explains: These firms are complying with Obamacare, which lets them offer wellness programs to their employees. These activities help workers lose weight, quit smoking, receive regular checkups, and otherwise become healthier. As an incentive, Obamacare offers participating employees as much as a 50 percent reduction in out-of-pocket medical expenses The comically titled Affordable Care Act requires that employees in these programs undergo medical tests to qualify for lower premiums. Unfortunately, such exams violate the Americans with Disabilities Act.  So, lets make sure we understand this: Employers can offer their workers wellness programs; but following the regulations for such programs result in a violations of the ADA. Well, Nancy Pelosi, Im certainly glad were finally figuring out whats in this thing; because Obamas Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would be three case-loads lighter if we hadnt passed this reform.  Of course, this shouldnt be unexpected. I mean, we have a community organizer trying to run an exponentially expanding Federal bureaucracy. (Dont get me wrong He clearly did a great job with that south side of Chicago.) But this isnt some sort of unforeseen complication of an incompetent government, its actually just the natural consequence of big government. Heck,Boston civil-liberties lawyer Harvey Silverglatesuggests that the average American unwittingly commits up to three felonies each day And he made that estimate before Obamacare, Dodd Frank, the EPAs overhaul of climate regulations, the FDAs war on soft cheeses, and Obamas slew of royal decrees executive orders. So, good news Honeywell Youre not alone. Youre just unlucky enough to have found yourself in some prosecutors crosshairs.  Good thing the Administration is busy crafting an executive order aimed at granting amnesty to people who knowingly broke Federal immigration laws Of course, that kinda brings up the bigger issue here, doesnt it? Our laws are so numerous, regulations so contradictory, and government so powerful, that it is merely the fickle benevolence of bureaucrats, attorneys, and politicians that keep the wrath of the judicial system at bay.  I would suggest to Honeywell that they begin to shift their political support to more libertarian and conservative causes, but Im sure an IRS audit would just be a nuisance right about now.

In spite of a sustained rally in home prices, the October Black Knight Financial Services Mortgage Monitor shows Four million borrowers currently underwater.HighlightsBlack Knight found that even though underwater mortgages are now less than 8% of all mortgages, there are still roughly 4 million borrowers in negative equity positions, who are, on average, $39,000 underwater.Underwater borrowers, representing nearly $800 billion in unpaid balances and $157 billion in negative equity, are 10X more likely to be delinquent than those with positive equity.Underwater borrowers exhibit a 40% delinquency rate, as compared to just 4% for borrowers with equityFor those with combined LTVs of 150% or greater, more than 3 out of every four (77%) are delinquentThere are approximately 1.3 million underwater GSE-backed mortgages representing an aggregate $39 billion in negative equity; of these, 365K are delinquentMuch-discussed principal reductions on delinquent underwater borrowers would require up to $89 billion in write-downs; the GSE share alone would require up to $18 billionBlack Knight found some relaxation in credit requirements for refinance originations (though these are still high by historical standards)Weighted average credit scores for GSE refinances have come down to 742 from a high of 766 in late 2011, while credit requirements on GSE purchase mortgages have remained tight since 2009GNMA backed originations have also seen some relaxation in refi credit requirements, with weighted average credit scores down from 727 at the end of 2012 to 701 (which is still significantly higher than 2005's average of 628)Looking at the refi market as a whole, Black Knight found that borrowers with 740+ credit scores make up 55% of 2014 refi market, as compared to just 29% in 2005Sustained Improvement in Negative EquityOver the past two and a half years, there has been a sustained and continual improvement in negative equity, from 33.5 percent of borrowers being underwater in January 2012 to less than eight percent today Only 1.2 percent of active mortgages have current CLTVs of 150 percent or higher, down from 9.5 percent in January of 2012 (the bottom of the market in terms of national home prices).Delinquencies by Bucket While the overall share of underwater mortgages continues to decline, delinquency rates are increasing among the remaining negative equity mortgages.For the severely underwater  150 percent or higher current CLTVs  over three out of every four borrowers (77 percent) are delinquent.Mike ""Mish"" Shedlockhttp://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com

Once again, the market closed at an all-time high on Wednesday; and once again, it was somewhat deceiving. The breadth is getting better and the Russell 2000 Index of small cap names put in a solid performance. I write about The Dow Theory a lot, and it harkens back to the old days when the stock market was a 100% representation of America. Now, it is a lot more complicated than that, but it is nice to see transportation stocks on the move.I think small caps, in the eye of the storm where shorts have decided to make their last stand, have to rally back to their old highs. It is not that far. The final spike in this market might need a spark from good financial news. However, it will be driven, not by dumb individual investors, but all the brilliant experts that have missed the rally and have bet big on its demise..The Cheap Gas ParadoxWe have discussed at length the virtues of cheap gas, but in fact, it is simply not the economic elixir many are hyping it up to be. Sure, we have more money in our pockets, but that does not make us feel any richer or even blessed, just a little relieved. It is not a spark to a virtuous cycle of spending.Let's say, you start out on a Monday with $50 bucks and head into work, and your first stop is to fill up the gas tank. When gas was higher, you might have put $30 bucks into the tank, and spent the rest on other things. In New York City, parking would have wiped that out, but let's say where you live, you could have parked, bought lunch, and perhaps downloaded a couple of tunes online.The whole $50 would go into the economy.Now, we begin Monday morning with the same routine, except this time, we only need $20 to fill up the tank, which would leave you with $10 extra to do other normal stuff. But out of those ten bucks, people are going to pay old bills, and even save some. We are not stupid; we know cheap gas is an anomaly and the price will rocket back one day.So, in this scenario, not all of the $50 would go into the economy.The Real AnswerThe real answer is higher wages. The only way to spark that virtuous cycle is through authentic prosperity that only comes with a bigger paycheck. The Fed can print money and people can use credit cards, but a real sustained spark that sees above trend growth starts with wages. Now, if we begin Monday with an extra $10 we become giddy, and even at a higher gas price, we will put more into the economy as we would probably save less, because we feel less insecure about our economic future.At the end of the day, it is about what actually makes it into the economy and triggers the kind of confidence where a penny earned is a penny spent, rather than a penny tucked away for future rainy days.

The actor and comedian Russell Brand has certainly tried brand himself. ""Messiah Complex"" was the name of his last tour. His new book is titled ""Revolution."" On ""The Tonight Show,"" he told Jimmy Fallon he's inspired by Jesus, Gandhi, Malcolm X and Che Guevara. He thinks he's like them. In Tinseltown, they're the Fab Four revolutionaries for the downtrodden. So it's shocking to him -- and no surprise to us -- when he gets exposed by the British press as a fraud. He's just another champagne socialist playacting.On Dec. 1, he led an angry march to No. 10 Downing Street in London to take a petition to the prime minister's residence protesting skyrocketing rents in the city. In particular, he was protesting for tenants of the New Era apartments, recently bought by an American investment company. The demand for downtown real estate has caused prices to soar, leaving the middle class in dire straits.Raise a glass to Paraic O'Brien of Channel Four, a publicly owned channel with a crusading edge that could teach a lesson or two to their American counterparts. He put the question directly to Brand: ""Part of the problem is the super rich buying property in London. Isn't it? How much did you pay for your place?"" Brand said his place is rented, as if that answered anything. So O'Brien asked how much he paid a month in rent. Brand took offense and became mighty defensive, sticking his face inches from the reporter and replying passionately, ""I'm not interested in talking to you about my rent, mate! I'm here to support a very, very important campaign. And you, as a member of the media, have an important duty to help represent these people, not to reframe the argument!""That's just priceless: He believes the media's role is to promote for what he's not, not expose him for what he is. O'Brien wasn't intimidated in the slightest and kept pushing: ""You're part of that problem, aren't you?"" Brand said ""absolutely not...I'm part of the solution!"" He then claimed not to know how much he paid in rent. Maybe we can jog his memory a bit. Brand lives within a mile of the trendy apartments he was protesting about -- in a fancy loft that rents for $8,000 a month. He sold his house in northwest London for $3.5 million in 2010, and last October, he bought a $2.2 million Hollywood mansion that once belonged to Sir Laurence Olivier. Not exactly ""struggling,"" are we, mate?It sounds a lot like documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, that great baseball-capped American populist whose recent divorce revealed he felt his wife was a ""spendthrift"" who embarrassed him by building a lakefront mansion in northwestern Michigan. The radical Moores were mocked for their act of conspicuous construction. Divorce papers showed that ""The couple's real estate holdings include a total of nine properties in Michigan and New York. The duo co-owns a Manhattan condo that was created through the combination of three separate units.""Being ""a voice for the voiceless"" is so rewarding -- financially rewarding -- as long as no one pries too much into just how rewarding it gets. The late radio star Casey Kasem really demonstrated this type 25 years ago as he organized a ""Housing Now"" march on Washington for the homeless. The Los Angeles Times reported with a wink that Kasem and his wife Jean ""turned their opulent $20,000-a-month, seven-room apartment at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel into the headquarters"" for this cause. While they demanded more tax money for the poor, ""They drive matching black Mercedes equipped with car phones. ... And this summer, Kasem bought his wife a little something for her birthday -- specifically, a three-bedroom, five-bath mansion in Holmby Hills complete with tennis court and swimming pool and $6.8-million price tag."" Reportedly they proudly declared they'd sent the leftovers down to the street for the homeless.The Times called them ""penthouse progressives."" The rest of us call them Hollywood hypocrites.

Rand Paul is Right: Cig Taxes Factored into Garner's Death

Reasonable people can disagree on whether racism was involved in the tragic death of Eric Garner. My own suspicion is that this misfortune could have transpired just as easily with a white man resisting arrest and/or a black cop choking him.And even though lots of people don't want to hear it, reasonable can disagree on whether illegally excessive force was to blame. Personally, watching the ubiquitous video of Garner's arrest, it looks like excessive force to me. But the simple fact is that a Staten Island grand jury saw evidence that led it to conclude otherwise. People should at least entertain the possibility that it might have gotten the ruling right.But you know what reasonable people can't dispute? New York's cigarette taxes are partly to blame for Eric Garner's death.Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky made this point Wednesday night on MSNBC's ""Hardball with Chris Matthews,"" and liberals have been freaking out about it ever since.""I think it's hard not to watch that video of him saying, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe,' and not be horrified by it,"" Paul said. ""But I think there's something bigger than the individual circumstances. ... I think it's also important to know that some politician put a tax of $5.85 on a pack of cigarettes, so that's driven cigarettes underground by making them so expensive. But then some politician also had to direct the police to say, 'Hey we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette.'... For someone to die over breaking that law, there really is no excuse for it. But I do blame the politicians. We put our police in a difficult situation with bad laws.""Now, Paul probably shouldn't have used the word ""bigger."" He clearly meant cigarette taxes are an issue that transcends the individual circumstances of Garner's death. But it was chum for critics who wanted to misunderstand him. For instance, a column by Salon's Joan Walsh suggested that Paul's answer ""wrecked"" his presidential prospects.""What kind of callousness is required to say the 'bigger' issue in Garner's death isn't excessive police use of force, or police practice toward African-Americans generally, but ... taxes?"" Walsh wrote. ""What kind of heart do you have to have to use the Eric Garner tragedy to rail against ... cigarette taxes?""Well, I don't know what kind of heart it requires, but I do know that anyone with a level head should understand -- and agree with -- Paul's point. When you pass a law, you authorize law enforcement to enforce it. That's actually why they're called ""law enforcement."" Google it.New York City declared war on tobacco a long time ago, and in the process City Hall has become addicted to Brobdingnagian cigarette taxes. That's why law enforcement is enforcing the laws against bootleg smokes.Of course, reasonable people can debate the wisdom of such laws. But only unreasonable people can deny that those laws are partly to blame. Without cigarette taxes, Eric Garner would be alive today, period.What's so strange about the outrage over Paul's remarks is that Paul's point is perfectly consistent with his -- and the left's -- opposition to the drug war.I ultimately disagree with Paul about that, but it's a morally serious argument. Even outright legalizers (Paul says he isn't one) aren't necessarily in favor of, say, heroin use. Rather, they argue that the costs of prohibition outweigh the benefits. Too many are imprisoned, too many are arrested, and too many die accidentally while being arrested. Well what's true of low-level heroin pushers is also true of low-level cigarette pushers. In the war on tobacco, like the war on drugs, if politicians will the ends, they must will the means.This is something that libertarians understand better than everyone else: The state is about violence. You can talk all day about how ""government is just another word for those things we do together,"" but what makes government work is force, not hugs.If you sell raw-milk cheese even after the state tells you to stop, eventually people with guns will show up at your home or office and arrest you. If you resist arrest, something very bad might happen. You might even die for selling bootleg cheese.Everyone agrees: No one should die for selling bootleg cigarettes. But if you pass and enforce a law against such things, you increase the chances things might go wrong. That's a fact, whether it sounds callous to delicate ears or not.

In the same vein as those who call terrorists who fly planes into tall buildings cowards, Foxs Bill OReilly pled for calm during the terrible Ferguson rioting on the grounds that such violence dishonors the the legacy of Michael Brown.   Unfortunately for young black men who will be affected by the death of Michael Brown, the Ferguson riots  and the violence that ensued  have become his legacy. Indeed, the prelude to the riots and the disgusting destruction of the livelihoods of many law-abiding small businessmen wasfittinglyMichael Browns strong-arm robbery of a cigar store. It was almost Michael Browns last act on this earth.   The video of the 300-pound Brown shoving the small and frightened clerk should make your blood boil, which is perhaps why I wasnt so interested in considering his legacy. If we want to have an honest conversation about what happened in Ferguson, MO, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future, we ought to spend less time blaming the system and more time unraveling the culture and motivations that enabled Browns actions and ultimately his demise.   Certainly it is distasteful to speak ill of the dead. Yet not speaking the truth about Brown is a sin and a disservice against black youthespecially young black men. Thats because not addressing Browns actions removes all agency from young men. It strips them of their free will and tells them they dont, in fact, have any control over their lives  that a white patriarchy really does still exist.   Michael Brown, like all of us, was complicated. It shows a good side that he struggled to make up credits to graduate from high school and was heading to for-profit Vatterott College to learn to be an air conditioning technician. But this is not the Michael Brown who, according to the grand jury report, ran at Officer Darren Wilson that fatal afternoon.   Still when the New York Times did a well-reported piece that concluded that Brown was no angel, there was uproar and subscriptions were cancelled. Is it really better not to know that Brown had drug and alcohol problems? Or that he collaborated on disturbing rap lyrics? Shouldnt these facts serve as warnings to other young men?   Brown has been applauded for not having been a member of a gang. His mother Lesley McSpadden told the Times, You may see him on a picture with some friends that may have been in a gang. He wasnt in a gang. He just knew how to adapt to his surroundings. Michael was so cool that he could just get along with anybody.  Perhaps a comment expected from the boys mother, but why not open our eyes to the fact that Browns violent actions almost certainly led to his death? This more than anything may have the potential to shake other young men into reality and realize their behavior can and does have lethal consequences.   Instead of addressing these issues head-on, consider how members of the Congressional Black Caucus streamed onto the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, holding up their hands and saying, Hands up, dont shoot (words we now know that Michael Brown almost certainly never used). Message to young black men: if you are stopped by a policeman, it makes no difference whether you put up your hands or go for his gun. Certainly as the Eric Garner incident indicates, police can be too aggressive; but it appears that race was not a factor when Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown.   The question we should all be asking is who really puts young black men at risk? Activists who promote their own careers by spreading this vicious but ultimately lucrative lie? (Its telling that The White Houses Ferguson adviser and all-purpose inciter of racial animosity Al Sharpton began his public ministry by perpetuating the Tawana Brawley lie back in the 1980s.)   In the wake of Ferguson, President Obama is spending $263 million on body cameras for the police (a good idea) and more training for law enforcement. If there is racial bias plaguing our police departments, we have a responsibility to call it out and to correct it. Still no evidence has been uncovered that Ferguson policeman Darren Wilson acted because of racial prejudice in shooting Michael Brown in self-defense.   Whats especially insidious about only addressing the racial bias of the police is that it relieves us as a society of the burden of talking about the other side of the story. We dont have to talk about the culture from which Michael Brown comes and the culture he leaves behind. Democrats want to make this about race, but it is really about families, missed opportunities, failed government policies, discipline, education, and personal responsibility.    President Obamas response to Ferguson makes one wonder if his much-praised My Brothers Keeper initiative, an idea that came to him after the death of Trayvon Martin, will address the issues that cause young black men to come to harm or will simply engage in race baiting the police. There are many aspects of black culture that My Brothers Keeper could help change. Michael Brown, for example, grew up being shuffled back and forth between his parents and living for long stretches with his grandmother. It appears to have been a far from stable environment. Like all kids who grow up in such environments, he deserved better.   But if President Obama were serious about healing the culture that caused Michael Brown's death, he would start by never ever inviting the Rev. Al Sharpton to the White House. Instead he would rethink critical policies in education, welfare, tax policy and regulations, that could actually help restore these communities and bring opportunity to thousands of Michael Browns.

We have found the new normal in America.If you are truly outraged by some action of police, prosecutors, grand juries, or courts, you can shut down the heart of a great city.Thursday night, thousands of ""protesters"" disrupted the annual Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, conducted a ""lie-in"" in Grand Central, blocked Times Square, and shut down the West Side Highway that scores of thousands of New Yorkers use to get home.That the rights of hundreds of thousands of visitors and New Yorkers were trampled upon by these self-righteous protesters did not prevent their being gushed over by TV commentators. Watching cable, I saw one anguished man cry out from a blocked car that he was trying to get his sick dog to the vet. But his rights were inferior to the rights of protesters to block traffic, chant slogans and vent their moral outrage to TV cameras. From New York to Washington to Oakland, crowds acted in solidarity to block main arteries at rush hour.Has President Obama condemned this? Has Eric Holder? Remarkable. Underlings of Gov. Chris Christie have been under investigation for a year for closing off lanes to the George Washington Bridge. Contrast liberal indignation at Christie, with liberal indulgence of the lawbreaking Thursday night, and you will see what people mean when they talk of a moral double-standard.What were these protests about? A grand jury on Staten Island voted not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner last July. As the video that has gone global shows, Pantaleo sought to arrest Garner, a 6'5"", 350-pound man arrested many times before. What was Garner doing?Selling cigarettes one by one on a main street, a public nuisance for the stores and shops in front of which he plied his trade, but not a felony, and surely not a capital offense. A misdemeanor at most.As Garner backed away and brushed aside attempts to handcuff him, Pantaleo grabbed him from behind by the neck to pull him down, as other cops swarmed in. Repeatedly, Garner cried, ""I can't breathe!"" On the ground he again cried, ""I can't breathe!"" And he died there on the sidewalk.Undeniably, terrible and tragic. Undeniably, not a natural death. And, undeniably, the way Garner was brought down and sat upon, an arm around his neck, contributed to, if it did not cause, his death. Yet Garner did not die by strangulation. According to the city medical examiner, he died from the ""compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."" The cops were holding him down by sitting on him.As Rep. Peter King said Thursday, ""If [Garner] had not had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese, he would not have died."" The Washington Post reports that the medical examiner seemed to confirm this, describing ""Garner's asthma and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors.""Why would a Staten Island grand jury not indict Pantaleo for murder or manslaughter in the death of Eric Garner?In a word, intent.Did Pantaleo intend to kill Eric Garner when he arrived on the scene? Did Pantaleo arrive intent on injuring Eric Garner? No and no. Pantaleo was there to arrest Garner, and if he resisted, to subdue him and then arrest him. That was his job.Did he use a chokehold, which the NYPD bans, or a takedown method taught at the police academy, as his lawyer contends?That is for the NYPD to decide. The grand jury, viewing the video, decided that the way Pantaleo brought down Garner was not done with any criminal intent to kill or injure him, but to arrest him. Garner's death, they decided, was accidental, caused by Pantaleo and the other NYPD cops who did not intend his injury or death, with Garner's asthma and heart disease as contributing factors.Now that grand jury decision may be wrong, but does it justify wild allegations of ""racist cops"" getting away with ""murder""? This reflexive rush to judgment happens again and again.We were told Trayvon Martin was shot to death by a white vigilante for ""walking while black,"" and learned that Trayvon, when shot, had been beating a neighborhood watch guy nearly unconscious, ""martial arts style,"" while sitting on top of him. We were told that Ferguson cop Darren Wilson gunned down an unarmed black teenager for walking in the street, and learned that Michael Brown just robbed a convenience store, attacked Wilson in his patrol car, and was shot trying to wrestle away the officer's gun.Liberals are imprisoned by a great myth -- that America is a land where black boys and men are stalked by racist white cops, and alert and brave liberals must prevent even more police atrocities.They live in a world of the mind.The reality: As of 2007, black-on-white violent crime was nearly 40 times as common as the reverse. But liberals can't give up their myth, for it sustains their pretensions to moral superiority. It defines who they are.

Last week, we closed the books on November, and it was clearly a winning month for stocks, with all three of the major indices putting in mid-single-digit percentage gains  quite the reversal from the September-to-mid-October sell-off! Despite being a compressed week, all three major stock market indices continued their climb higher and closed the first 11 months up 7.5% (Dow Jones Industrial Average) to 14.7% (S&P 500).  While you and I were noshing on turkey, stuffing and pie this past Thanksgiving Thursday, the global economy continued to turn, and in some respects it wasnt all that pretty. Chinas National Bureau of Statistics reported net income for the top companies slowed to 6.7% in the January-October period, compared with a 7.9% rise in the first nine months. Sifting into that report, we found that Chinas industrial profit fell 2.1% year over year. Its not just China, as we continue to get data weakness in the euro zone, and the recent bout of winter weather in the United States is already causing economists to tweak their 4Q 2014 expectations lower. Youve probably been enjoying the near-steady move lower in gas prices during the last several weeks. The good news is with OPEC refraining from production cuts following its Thursday meeting last week as it looks to defend its market share against other producers, oil continued its plunge with West Texas Intermediate down 10% to $66.15 per barrel last Friday. The move is likely to drive gas-at-the-pump prices even lower than we saw last week  $2.79 per gallon nationally, marking the lowest Thanksgiving holiday price since 2009  with Lipow Oil Associates calling for the national average to drop to between $2.55 and $2.60 a gallon by Christmas. The big question is whether or not consumers are spending through on those big gas savings or banking them. According to research firm ShopperTrak, U.S. shoppers spent $9.1 billion at stores on Black Friday, a drop of 7% compared with the same day last year. But remember  a slew of stores were opening up on Thanksgiving, and its looking more like that pulled Black Friday sales downward  sales on Thanksgiving jumped 24% to $3.2 billion, and putting the data together shows overall sales for the two days likely slipped 0.5% to $12.29 billion.  That figure excludes online transactions, but over the weekend, IBM reported online sales for Black Friday climbed 9.5% over the same day last year. Even leading up to Thanksgiving, online sales have been taking share from brick-and-mortar spending, according to data from ComScore. The company, a leader in measuring the digital world, reported holiday season retail e-commerce spending for the first 23 days of the November-December 2014 holiday season rose to $17.5 billion, up 11% versus the corresponding days last year. Over the weekend, ComScore shared its Thanksgiving and Black Friday findings, and it more than confirmed IBMs take. Per ComScore, Thanksgiving Day saw a 32% gain to $1.01 billion in online spending to surpass the billion-dollar threshold for the first time in its history and to mark the first day of the 2014 season to reach that level. Black Friday (Nov. 28) followed with an even stronger spending day, with $1.51 billion in desktop online sales, up 26% from Black Friday 2013. That data bodes very well for my subscribers that heeded my recommendation to buy what I call my online shopping trifecta  Amazon.com (AMZN), Visa (V) and United Parcel Service (UPS). While each of those shares has climbed nicely during the last several weeks, the real money to be made was in trading the respective call options. Subscribers to my PowerOptions Trader service had the opportunity to book gains of 228% on the recommended Visa calls, 248% on the respective United Parcel Service calls and were still holding Amazon.com calls. Thus far weve booked another triple-digit percentage win in one of the two recommended AMZN calls I shared with PowerOptions Trader subscribers, and with data like that from IBM and ComScore, it looks like more are on the way. If youre new to trading options or not, combining my proprietary PowerTrend investing framework with options has resulted in ringing the register on 10 triple-digit percentage trades during the last two months. Of course, I only share them with my subscribers. To get on board, click here.

Today President Obama announced former Pentagon official Ashton Carter is his nominee to replace recently resigned Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.He knows the Department of Defense inside and out, Obama stated Friday, which means he will hit the ground running.
Carter has served under 11 Secretaries of Defense during his tenure in the Pentagon. From Oct. 2011 to Dec. 2013 Carter was the second-highest ranking official in the Department of Defense. As deputy defense secretary, he served as the chief operating officer and chief managing officer. Carter also served as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under the Clinton Administration.

There are countless Americans who are alive today, in part because of Ashs efforts, Obama claimed. He is also a physicist, which means he is one of the few people who understands how our defense system [works].""The new nominee has never served in the military or in Congress. However, like Obama, he has an impressive resume as an academic. Carter graduated from Yale University with bachelors degrees in both physics and medieval history, and went on to become one of the prestigious Rhodes Scholars at Oxford University. He later spent time at teaching positions at both Harvard and MIT.There are no shortages of challenges to our national security, Obama said. However, his confidence in Carters advice has already been well established as they have worked together in the Situation Room.Moving forward, Obama cited a desire to invest in new capabilities to meet long term threats, such as cyber defense and satellites.

Sen.Mary Landrieu has finally weighed in on thecaught-on-tapecall from a Louisiana Democratic official for supporters to commit voter fraud by casting more than one ballot in last month's election. You'll be relieved to know that she's reviewed the tape and has come to the conclusionthat her (refreshingly candid!) chief of staff's father was just kidding. A local NBC affiliate addressed the controversy -- be sure tostay tuned for the decidedly un-amused reaction fromaverage voters,and pardon the technical difficulties when the stationattempts to playback Don Cravins Sr'sproblematicremarks:



""It was in a bar room. It was, you know, on a stage. People were having a good time. It seemed to me to be a joke.""

Question for Mary: Was your chief of staff also joking when he promised thatyou'd keep onvoting with Obama97 percent of the time if re-elected? He said so in that same bar room,where people were having a good time. Was that whole election eve rally just a big comedy show?For what it's worth, the elderCravins nowinsists he was just joshin' around, rather than, you know,telling people to vote twice whileassuring them that they'd avoid prosecution for doing so because of the Democratic District Attorney's lax stance on voter fraud. Which isprecisely what he says on the tape: 



For good measure, Cravins also attacks Black Conservatives Fund for noticing his comments. How dare they? If you watched all the way to the end of the first clip, you'd see Landrieu comparing herself to Saints quarterback Drew Brees, warning voters against replacing her with cluelessrookie Bill Cassidy (a mere medical doctor and Congressman). Theproblem for Landrieu is that Brees isbothgood at his job andquite popular in Louisiana, among otherkey distinctions. Oh, and Brees suresounds like...a Republican.

Evidence mounts that President Obama is reacting with greater defiance and lawlessness despite Americans' repudiation of his agenda in the November elections, and the word is that Republican leaders in Congress are relaxing their resistance.Isn't it axiomatic that if you reward bad behavior you'll get more of it and that if you punish it you'll deter it? Then why would certain Republicans choose to reward behavior they are on record condemning?I'm talking about not the president's making policy choices we disagree with but which he has constitutional authority to implement. Increasingly, he has become a law unto himself, rewriting substantive provisions of laws Congress not only opposes but has expressly rejected.His recent executive actions on immigration and health care are breathtaking in their scope and unprecedented in their overt illegality.Why would Obama stop? He certainly has no respect for the United States Constitution, so there is no chance he will rein himself in. Nor will he listen to dissenting voices. As the public's disapproval of his policies and behavior increases, his self-imposed isolation bubble hardens. One wonders whether he listens to anyone outside of his own narcissistic voice, White House consigliore Valerie Jarrett and first lady Michelle Obama.Even The Washington Post's editorial board has come down squarely against Obama's action on immigration, in its editorial titled ""President Obama's unilateral action on immigration has no precedent.""The writers dispute the White House's claim that Obama's unilateral action to legalize the presence of millions of immigrants is consistent with actions of previous presidents, saying, ""In fact, it is increasingly clear that the sweeping magnitude of Mr. Obama's order is unprecedented.""In the first place, there is no small deception in the White House's comparing of Obama's order to that of President George H.W. Bush's 1990 order because it affected about the same percentage of immigrants (1.5 million of the 3.5 million immigrants at the time). The Post says, ""The actual number affected by the 1990 order was clearly a fraction -- perhaps a couple of hundred thousand people, at most -- of the 1.5 million that Obama administration officials have cited.""In addition, Bush's action was consistent with legislation recently and subsequently enacted by Congress, whereas ""Obama's move flies in the face of congressional intent -- no matter how indefensible that intent looks.""The Post wrongly castigates Republicans for failing to pass an immigration reform bill but admits, ""Republicans' failure to address immigration ... does not justify Mr. Obama's massive unilateral act.""The Post doesn't mention certain other hugely damning facts. President Obama's order isn't just an exercise of ""prosecutorial discretion."" His order won't just stop deportations; it will grant tentative status and work permits to illegal immigrants, as if he has the power to pass positive law without congressional approval and in defiance of Congress' express wishes.If a mere discretionary act were all that is involved, why would Obama be planning for an amnesty processing facility with 1,000 new immigration agents in northern Virginia, as incoming Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jeff Sessions just discovered and reported?Sessions said in a statement that this facility will ""quickly approve applications for the President's illegal amnesty, which will provide work permits, photo IDs, Social Security, and Medicare to illegal immigrants -- all benefits rejected by Congress. This action will mean that American workers, their sons, their daughters, their parents, will now have to compete directly for jobs, wages, and benefits with millions of illegal immigrants.""In the meantime, health care policy expert Betsy McCaughey reports that among the 3,415 federal regulations the Obama administration quietly imposed immediately before Thanksgiving, Obama has unilaterally made significant changes to the Affordable Care Act again. He is redefining what health plans will be deemed ""adequate"" for large employers under the law, and he's ""asking"" insurers to subsidize new benefits and warning that if they were to refuse, they might be forced to do so.President Obama acts lawlessly so often and so egregiously that it seems some have grown numb to it. Sen. Sessions, to his great credit, is strongly recommending that Congress block federal dollars to implement his executive amnesty action. We need similar resistance on his many Obamacare overreaches.Yet we hear the Republican leadership isn't on board with plans to actively challenge Obama. The Daily Caller is reporting, ""House Speaker John Boehner will ask Rep. Nancy Pelosi to help him overcome 'snowballing' GOP opposition to the GOP leadership's draft 2015 government budget bill."" Also, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer has indicated that Boehner's aides have asked him to deliver Democratic votes to ensure passage of the amnesty-funding bill.I don't know yet whether or to what extent these reports are true, but if there is a smidgen of truth to them, people must rise up in one voice against these ongoing outrages. Obama's lawlessness has to be stopped, and we won't stop it if the opposition party refuses to fight back and its leaders get in bed with Obama's Democratic enablers.

How to Beat the Traditional S&S 500 Index
Nicholas Vardy | Dec 05, 2014














Share on Facebook
































John Bogle has been a thorn in the side of active stock pickers ever since the 1970s. As an evangelist of index fund investing, Bogle has been preaching for decades that on average, stock pickers cant outperform the market over the long term. Whats most annoying is that  unlike most investment gurus  hes been consistently right. Over the past 25 years, only 38.6% of active funds have outperformed the broader S&P 500 on an annual basis. And good luck with finding the fund that outperforms the S&P 500, year after year, over that time period, and in advance. Active stock pickers consistent underperformance is due to a combination of bad judgment, higher trading and management costs and just plain human hope and hubris  believing that their subjective insight works better than just, well, buying the market and calling it a day. Bogles own confidence in indexing must be reaching an all-time high in 2014. While on average close to four out of 10 managers outperform the S&P 500 every year, this year that number has fallen to less than one out of 10. If that holds, it just might be the lowest percentage ever. Another couple of more years like this, and even the most ardent stock pickers will have a tough time believing they add value. Truth be told, active stock pickers have had the deck stacked against them in 2014. First, any stock picker invested in foreign stocks has had a millstone around her neck. The relentless doom-and-gloomers notwithstanding, the U.S. market has been one of the top-performing markets in the world in three out of the last four years. Second, with small-cap stocks trailing U.S. large caps by over 10% this year, any active managers who invested in anything but the biggest stocks in search of value or better growth have had their heads handed to them. Finally, sectors and investment themes have been going in and out of favor with unprecedented speed. Last year, it was energy stocks that were hot. This year, these same stocks have collapsed while both high-risk biotech and low-risk utilities stocks have soared. There is little method to the madness of such rapid sector rotation. Smart Beta Funds: A Better Mousetrap? Being dumb and long in the U.S. index has trounced just about every active strategy out there. But Im here to tell you that there is even a better investment mousetrap. As well as S&P 500 index funds have done in in the past 40 years, one group of funds has done even better. In fact, as much as Bogle gets underneath the skin of active managers, it is smart beta or alternative index funds that give Bogle himself the woolies. And for good reason. Smart beta funds are like index funds in that they are passive. The difference is that they are based on alternative indexes. As it turns out, the index upon which a passive strategy is based makes all the difference. And once you are willing to tweak the indexes, that is, how you define the market, there are all sorts of different ways you can skin this investment cat. A traditional S&P 500 Index weighs stocks by market capitalization. The bigger the company, the bigger the weight in the index. Thats why the top 10 stocks account for 17.87% of the S&P 500. But it turns out you can construct an index using all sorts of other criteria: fundamentals, momentum or even by tracking companies buying back their own stock. Lets look at the simplest alternative index strategy. Instead of weighting the S&P 500 stocks by market capitalization, take the same 500 stocks and weight them equally  and rebalance them at the end of every quarter to keep them from getting too far out of whack. With this approach, the top 10 stocks will account for a mere 2% of the index. This simple strategy has outperformed the traditional market-cap-weighted indexes by over 2% a year since 1967. So far this year, it has outperformed the indexes by a more modest 0.45%. That is a massive difference, especially as you compound it over time. Just take a look at the performance of theGuggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP)since it was launched in 2003.  So heres my heartfelt recommendation: Dump your traditional S&P 500 Index Fund, and buy theGuggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). And call me in 10 years to thank me. In case you missed it, I encourage you to read my e-letter column from last week about how my favorite contrarian indicator shows Russia is ripe for a rebound.

Ferguson Vs. New York City

The grand jury system -- indeed, the criminal jury system overall -- is not perfect. And while I think the grand jury in Ferguson got it right by not indicting Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown, based on the physical evidence and credible testimony from actual witnesses, the outcome of a grand jury in New York City this week in the death of Eric Garner is another matter. The two cases are worlds apart in terms of the actions of the men who died and the officers who caused their deaths. Unfortunately, on both sides of the argument, proponents seem all too ready to adopt a narrative that fits their politics rather than examining the facts.In Ferguson, the race hustlers and their enablers, from Al Sharpton to Eric Holder, turned an unfortunate confrontation that ended in the death of a black man into a cause celebre. Racism did not cause Brown's death. Nor was he the victim of a police execution, as thousands of protestors try to convince us with their ""hands up, don't shoot"" mantra. We know from forensics and testimony by African-American witnesses that Brown reached into the police cruiser, sustained a gunshot wound, ran away, with Wilson in pursuit, but then turned back and moved toward Wilson, who shot him. Casings from the officer's bullets and the location of Brown's body when he sustained the fatal shot demonstrate that Wilson was moving backward in apparent retreat at the time of Brown's death. What happened on the streets of Staten Island between Eric Garner and a group of police officers looks nothing like what happened in Ferguson. Moreover, we know what happened far more clearly because a bystander filmed much of the confrontation. Those images make the grand jury's decision far less understandable. For all of the criticism of St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch's decision to release the transcripts and evidence from the grand jury, at least we have some idea of what led to the decision not to indict. In the New York case, we don't have a clue.What the video shows is a large black man arguing with police officers who are about to arrest him for the alleged resale of individual cigarettes. He is frustrated, angry even. He accuses the officers of harassing him -- he was arrested in an earlier incident on the same charge, the pettiest of offenses, a crime with no victims. But Garner is not a threat, although he resists arrest when a group of officers surround him, telling them not to touch him as he moves backward, not toward the police. The video clearly shows Officer Daniel Pantaleo grabbing Garner from behind, with the officer's forearm pressed against Garner's neck, and wrestling him to the ground, the forearm against Garner's throat the whole time. I doubt that Pantaleo intended to kill Eric Garner, but that does not mean Pantaleo was blameless. The audio also demonstrates that Garner pleaded with what were by then several officers who held him on the ground, including one who pressed Garner's skull into the sidewalk. ""I can't breathe,"" the asthmatic Garner begs over and over as a bevy of officers hold him down.Police have difficult, dangerous jobs in which split-second decisions can have deadly consequences. But Eric Garner was no Michael Brown, and the officers who held down Garner -- including, but not limited to, Daniel Pantaleo -- had no reason to fear for their lives as Darren Wilson did. To pretend that police never overreact or use excessive force is as wrong as to claim racism is usually to blame when a police officer kills a black or Latino suspect. Neither serves the public good. In the case of Ferguson, the U.S. attorney general and an army of media quickly descended on the town in search of evidence of racism. But the facts didn't comport with their presumption. It's unclear whether race played any role in what led to Eric Garner's death. At least one of the police officers in the video is black and another appears to be Asian. But racism is not the only motivation for police to sometimes exceed their authority, to use excessive force, even to behave brutally. Police power is an awesome force -- and one that requires reasonable restraint.  One does not have to be a bleeding-heart liberal to find fault with the grand jury's decision in New York City. The facts, not politics, should guide our reaction in both cases.

In his ""Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior,"" George Washington offered this sage advice: ""Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.""Too bad President Obama and his best Chicago golfing buddy (BCGB), Dr. Eric Whitaker, didn't heed our Founding Father's wisdom. The duo's continued intimacy, as the stench of government corruption thickens around them, speaks volumes about our current commander in chief's reckless disregard for his reputation.How close is Obama to the beleaguered doc? They met playing basketball while grad students at Harvard -- and have been goofing off together for years. Since Obama first moved into the White House, Whitaker has been a regular traveling companion. He hit the links with the First Duffer at Martha's Vineyard in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014. Whitaker accompanied Obama to Hawaii in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013.Whitaker also played hoops with Obama during a three-day getaway to Chicago in February 2009, attended the Obamas' first state dinner in November 2009, and traveled with Obama to Norway in December 2009 for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.This is no casual acquaintance. Obama and Whitaker are tighter than skinny jeans on One Direction bandmates.The Chicago chumminess extends to first lady Michelle Obama. According to Chicago magazine's Carol Felsenthal, Whitaker's physician wife, Cheryl, traveled with Mrs. Obama to battleground states during the 2008 presidential campaign. They've been ""gym workout buddies"" for decades and grew close while both were employed at the University of Chicago Medical Center.As you may recall, Mrs. Obama held a cushy, six-figure salaried post at the medical center. Her most infamous project: a rather un-progressive patient-dumping scheme (promoted by Obama crony David Axelrod's public relations firm) to offload poor clients in order to clear up bed space for wealthier insured customers.Eric Whitaker took over for Mrs. Obama as a $700,000-a-year executive vice president of the medical center and director of the ""Urban Health Initiative"" when she moved to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. In 2012, the Obama administration awarded the program a nearly $6 million grant to build a government-sponsored electronic medical record-sharing system.Whitaker had previously served as head of the Illinois Department of Public Health, a job he secured thanks to the ""glowing"" recommendation of then-Illinois state Sen. Barack Obama to now-convicted political fixer Tony Rezko. Rezko vetted appointees for now-convicted Gov. Rod Blagojevich and also provided critical seed money for Obama's U.S. Senate campaign.As I noted in ""Culture of Corruption"" in 2009, Rezko pulled the strings at the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board overseeing medical construction projects. Whitaker sat as the resident stooge ""overseeing"" that panel's budget, which crooked Rezko exploited to solicit kickbacks and payoffs. His wanton abuse of power over the agency led to his 2011 conviction. Whitaker claimed he knew nothing.It seems that everyone Whitaker has surrounded himself with is either in jail or on trial. The corruptitis is contagious. Last summer, the feds indicted Whitaker's former chief of staff, Quinshaunta R. Golden, on bribery, theft and fraud charges related to the embezzlement of $433,000 in state health department funds. Golden and another Whitaker underling, Roxanne Jackson, pleaded guilty this spring.Once again, Whitaker claimed he knew nothing.Fun fact: Whitaker also happens to be the man identified by author Edward Klein as the fixer who attempted to bribe the race-baiting Rev. Jeremiah Wright to keep quiet about his friendship with Barack Obama.The D.C. press corps has looked the other way at Obama's BCGB. But this know-nothing crony made headlines this week in the Windy City, where federal prosecutors asked a judge to declare the White House BCGB a ""hostile witness"" in a sordid taxpayer grant scandal. Yet another close Whitaker associate, Chicago businessman Leon Dingle Jr., is on trial for filching $3 million in state taxpayer grants for vacation homes and fancy cars. The feds say the scheme also benefited Whitaker on at least three occasions. Yet, scandal-magnet Whitaker has not been charged with any crimes.Birds of a foul feather cover up together, eh, President Obama?

Before the report, ""consensus projections"" were that there would be 230,000 jobs added to the economy, so this report is a huge surge over expectations. The broader U-6 measure of unemployment, which takes into account broader measures of underemployment dipped to 11.4%.

Last month, BLS's report was that the economy added 214,000 jobs, but each of these reports includes revisions, and the BLS now estimates that that estimate was too low, and added 29,000 more jobs to that estimate. With revisions to previous months, we've had one of the strongest three-month stretches of jobs gains in a long time. Indeed, it's the single best stretch of jobs creation in the Obama era. 

The U.S. has added 2.73 million jobs over the last 12 months, the best such stretch in 8.5 years pic.twitter.com/qEdfbvenPS Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) December 5, 2014


The headline unemployment rate is below 6%, which we might try to say is an indicator of the health of the economy. But what characterized our pre-recession economy was a much, much higher labor force participation rate. Ever since 2008, a far smaller propotion of the American population has even been considered a part of the labor force. BLS estimated that the labor force participation rate is now 62.8% - unchanged from the previous month - which is much, much lower than the rates in the 90s and 2000s that were in the high 60-percentage range.

Forget the recent Congressional Committee report absolving the Obama Administration of wrongdoing over the attacks in Benghazi which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans. The real question underlying Benghazi is why Americans serving this country overseas were set up to be killed by a State Department who ignored warnings from security experts that the Benghazi Consulate was ripe for the picking for terrorists intent on attacking Americans, and American interests in Libya. As has been the practice of this administration since it took office, the default position is to obfuscate, delay, blame others, or lie when confronted with their failures.  Hence Susan Rices appearance on news programs following the Benghazi tragedy. As expected the mainstream media exhibited a remarkable lack of curiosity about the details of the Benghazi attacks, beyond reporting the fact that the attacks had occurred.   Once initial indications showed that the Obama Administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have some culpability resulting from their lack of security preparations as we approached the anniversary of September 11, 2001, the media went into full damage control mode protecting Obama and Clinton as best they could.  Either questioning the integrity and motives of career diplomats, investigators, and Congressional committees, or accusing outright that calls for an investigation were politically motivated, The Obama Administration, Hillary Clinton, and their allies in the news media went into attack mode as a means of covering up their own negligence. Oh to have been a fly on the wall watching Secretary Clinton rehearse her anticipated testimony before the congressional committee looking into the Benghazi failures.  Just how many takes did it require for her to be able to show the right amount of indignation as she pounded the table in front of her in the rehearsal room ?  Did she have to repeat it, watching the video playback over and over so that she could get it right for her performance in front of Congress ?  One can imagine the laughter around the room as Clinton screwed up her lines and had to take it from the top again and again.  A little chilling when one thinks about it, considering what she was to testify about. An unbiased look at the facts we do know about what happened in Benghazi shows that at the least what was determined was there was evidence of poor judgment and planning on the part of the Obama Administrations State Department, overseen by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.   Enough to harm her future political aspirations ?  Apparently the Clintons thought so, which is why they and their supporters went into full attack mode against anyone, including honorable career diplomats, military members, and other government officials who might present a potential threat by telling the truth. While the deaths of four dedicated Americans serving their country is certainly a tragedy for the families of those who lost their lives, its also a great loss for this nation.  We depend upon dedicated and conscientious people to help defend Americas interests overseas, and spread the message of America as a beacon of freedom in a far too often dangerous world.  The fact that no one has been held accountable in the Obama Administration and Hillary Clintons State Department is an outrage. While career bureaucrats sat on their posteriors in Washington, D.C. looking for ways to cover their backsides, courageous Americans put their lives on the line, and in Benghazi gave their lives, in service to a grateful nation.

I like to think that I occasionally put together interesting and persuasive charts on fiscal policy.For instance, I think its virtually impossible to make a credible argument for tax hikes after looking at my chart showing how easy it is to balance the budget with modest spending restraint.But Ill freely confess that no chart of mine can compare to this powerful image created by my Cato colleague, Andrew Coulson, which shows how spending and staffing for the government school monopoly have exploded while enrollment and performance have been stagnant.As far as Im concerned, no honest person can look at his chart and defend the current system.But some folks may need some more evidence about the failure of government schools, so lets look at stories from both ends of America.Well start on the east coast. Writing for the Daily Caller, Eric Owens reports that bureaucrats in a New Jersey town are being handsomely rewarded for not educating students.Only 19 students in the public school system in Paterson, N.J. who have taken the SAT scored high enough to be considered college ready, local Fox affiliate WWOR-TV reports. At the same time, 66 employees in the Paterson school district each soak taxpayers for salaries of at least $125,000 per year, the Paterson Press reports. Paterson is no tiny town. It is, in fact, the third-largest city in New Jersey. The population is roughly 146,000 people. The city boasts some 50 public schools altogether. There are over 24,000 total students in all grades.But the folks in Paterson can be proud of their government schools. After all, theyre doing much better than Camden.In December 2013, Camdens then-new superintendent of public schools announced that only three  THREE!  students in the entire district who took the SAT during the 2011-12 academic year scored high enough to qualify as college-ready.Last but not least, the story notes that the school district has concocted a clever strategy to avoid any more embarrassing stories.Youre probably wondering whether this means school choice? Rigorous standards? Better discipline?Nope, nope, and nope. Remember, were dealing with government bureaucracy.Back in Paterson, school officials say they have cleverly dealt with their nearly complete failure to prepare students for college entrance exams by no longer using the SAT to assess student achievement.I actually hope this is a joke, though theres no indication in the story to suggest the reporter is being satirical.So we have bureaucrats getting vastly overpaid in exchange for not educating kids.Now lets travel to the west coast, where Los Angeles schools also have overpaid officials who do a crummy job of educating students, but they have figured out very novel ways of squandering tax dollars.As Robby Soave reports in Reason, the LA school district first tried a failed scheme to give every student an iPad, which led to predictable fraud and misuse with no accompanying educational benefit. Now they want to double down on failure with a new proposal that gives various schools the option of which bit of high-tech gadgetry to mis-utilize.Who could be against choice? Thats the argument Los Angeles school district administrators are now employing to push their latest round of expensive technology upgrades. Schools will be given the choice to receive Chromebooks instead of iPadsand some schools will get laptops, the most expensive option of all. The idea is to eventually place such a device in the hands of every child in the district.Needless to say, theres no strategy for avoiding the mistakes that plagued the earlier scheme.The problem administrators encountered when rolling out the iPad plan, however, was that kids kept losing or breaking the devices. What happens then? Do parents pay, or does the district? Do kids get a replacement? Teachers also struggled mightily to incorporate the technology into their lesson plans, and concerns about kids using iPads for unsanctioned purposes caused headaches. The initial iPad deal unravelled after allegations of an improper relationship between then District Superintendent John Deasy, Apple, and curriculum company Pearson.The reporter is understandably skeptical about what will happen next.I have little reason to believe that the individual schools will be more responsible stewards of the taxpayers money than the district was. Indeed, 21 schools decided to go with an even more expensive option: laptops. Steve Lopez of the LA Times argued persuasively in October that the iPad fiasco was a costly diversion from the districts real problems. Schools cant even find the money for math textbooks, but administrators want to force unneeded technology on them and impose computerized tests. The district should prioritize basic instruction before deciding to purchase thousands of fancy gadgets.Gee, its almost enough to make you think that government schools dont work very well and that we should instead allow parents to have real choice over how to best educate their children.P.S. You wont be surprised to learn that Obamas silly common core proposalappears to be driving some of these bad results.P.P.S. Though remember that Bushs no-bureaucrat-left-behind scheme was also a flop.P.P.P.S. School choice doesnt automatically mean every child will be an educational success, but evidence from Sweden, Chile, and the Netherlands shows good results after breaking up state-run education monopolies.And theres growing evidence that it also works in the limited cases where it exists in the United States.P.P.P.P.S. Or we can just stick with the status quo, which involves spending more money, per student, than any other nation while getting dismal results.P.P.P.P.P.S. This is a depressing post, so lets close with a bit of humor showing theevolution of math lessons in government schools.P.P.P.P.P.P.S. If you want some unintentional humor, the New York Times thinks that education spending has been reduced.

The Democrats War on Women fell flat in 2014. Hopefully well never see it again. S.E. Cupp reports for the December issue of Townhall Magazine.Democrats are busy licking their wounds from the defeats they faced in the 2014 midterms.If the Democrats are capable of introspection, I hope they realize that the War on Women narrative that drove so many giddy Democrats to the polls in the 2012 presidential election fell spectacularly flat this year. Stick a fork in it, it's officially cooked.In fact, it's fair to say in a number of races it was overblown allegations of invisible sexism, fear-mongering and pandering about anti-women Republicans (who sometimes were women), and a narrow, single-issue focus on reproductive rights for multi-issue women voters that tanked otherwise viable campaigns.With an unpopular president and, more importantly, unpopular Democratic policies driving Democrats to desperation this year, we witnessed a meme jump the shark in real time. Let's all take a moment to mourn the death of a truly terrible and regrettable moment in American politics, when liberals unsuccessfully exploited women voters to get out of having to defend their abysmal record of making their lives worse on nearly every economic indicator.As they prepare to launch a 2016 campaign promoting ""the first woman president,"" let's put some of the low lights in perspective:In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall (D) spent so much time on women's issues that he was, not affectionately, nicknamed Mark Uterus on the campaign trail. For all that ""love"" he gave women, he was only 6 points ahead among the fairer sex in the weeks leading up to the election. His opponent, Cory Gardner, was 21 points ahead among men, otherwise known as ""the other voters."" One high-profile Democratic donor complained loudly that ""abortion is all he talks about.""In New York a Democratic candidate for state representative, Martha Robertson, was booed during a debate for accusing her Republican male candidate of engaging in a War on Women.In Wisconsin, a liberal activist group issued a press release accusing five Republicans of being anti-woman for their criticism of Democratic candidate for Attorney General Susan Happ. But the release neglected to mention all five Republicans were also women themselves because, well, then the claim would sound ridiculous.In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) grew so desperate toward the end of her Senate campaign that she accused Southerners, otherwise known as voters, of being both sexist and racist for Democrats' lack of popularity in her state. ""Prove you're not by voting for me!"" she seemed to imply.In Texas, Democrats accused Republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' fudged biography. Because ""the truth"" is a sexist pursuit when a liberal is the target.When MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid asked Daily Show creator and Democrat defender Lizz Winstead why Davis was having such a tough time there, despite her attention to women's issues, Winstead replied, earnestly, that the problem was ""redistricting."" In a governor's race. She was not corrected by the liberal host.For all of these absurd efforts at dodging, spinning, and hyperventilating, Democrats lost crucial races and gained very little among actual women voters. In fact, Democrats' deficits among men outpace Republicans' deficits among women. Ignoring half the country, crying wolf over non-existent sexism, distracting from the issues with patently absurd gender pandering, and assuming voters of either sex are too stupid to see through it didn't pay off this time. But in the absence of anything else, it appeared to be all they had. Time will tell if the Left can cobble together an actual agenda before 2016, or if it prefers to rely on hackneyed political slogans from 2011 to get their girl the job. After witnessing the collapse of this narrative in 2014, part of me hopes they stick to the script.S.E. Cupp is author of Losing Our Religion: The Liberal MediasAttack on Christianity. She has a weekly column in the New YorkDaily News and is a co-host of CNNs Crossfire.

Terry Bean is a donor to the Democratic Party. He has hung out with Barack Obama on Air Force Once. He founded the influential gay-rights organization Human Rights Campaign, which targets and harasses Christians. The organization, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center, labeled the conservative Family Research Council a ""hate group."" Unsurprisingly, a gay rights activist showed up at the Family Research Council with a bag full of Chick-fil-A sandwiches. He intended to stuff the mouths of Family Research Council employees after he killed them.A couple of weeks ago, the state of Oregon indicted Terry Bean on charges of sodomy and sexual abuse of a 15-year-old boy.Donny Ray Williams was, until recently, the 37-year-old staff director for the U.S. Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee. He worked, at various times, for Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Herb Kohl (D-WI) as well as Representatives Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL). Last week, Donny Ray Williams pled guilty to sexually assaulting two women. He invited them to his apartment, promised access to the corridors of power, and then gave them drinks laced with Ambien. Once the young women were asleep, Williams sexually assaulted them. For this, Donny Ray Williams will get a suspended jail sentence and probation. Jonathan Gruber, many liberals claimed, was the architect of Obamacare. After videotapes of Gruber surfaced where he explained how the Obama administration doctored financial data to con the American people, Democrats ran quickly from Gruber. But until then, through 2009 until earlier this year, Gruber was heralded as a Democrat hero. Sarah Kliff of the liberal site Vox once described Gruber as ""the health economist who pretty much wrote Obamacare."" After the release of the Gruber tapes, Kliff walked it all back claiming he was just some guy.Nancy Pelosi, in 2009, relied on Jonathan Gruber to explain just how wrong Republicans would be in their claims about Obamacare. In November of this year, Pelosi claimed she had never heard of Gruber. The White House too tried to claim Gruber was a nobody until pictures surfaced of Gruber with President Obama in the Oval Office.Colleen Bell is the former producer of the soap opera ""The Bold and the Beautiful."" She is also a top Obama campaign donor. As Russia begins to stretch its arms across Eastern Europe, the nation of Hungary has begun descending into fascism. The Hungary Prime Minister has declared the end of liberal democracy and is seeking closer times with Moscow. Barack Obama has decided that times such as these demand Colleen Bell be the American Ambassador to Hungary. Bell, in her Senate confirmation, could name no strategic interests the United States has with Hungary.Elizabeth Lauten was, until her resignation last week, a staffer for Congressman Steve Fincher of Tennessee. Lauten took to her personal Facebook page to criticize President Obama's daughters for their outfits and behavior in the White House as their father cracked lame jokes in pardoning two turkeys before Thanksgiving. In a campaign coordinated with White House staff, the national press corp savaged Lauten. Driven from her job, she received death threats for her Facebook post.The Washington Post pulled reporters off other stories and sent them to camp out at Elizabeth Lauten's parents' home. More than one million Internet entries were created over Lauten's comments. NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post and other media outlets treated Lauten's comments as major news stories. They gave repeated, top-of-the-headlines treatment to this staffer's comments.In fact, major national news outlets gave more coverage to Elizabeth Lauten than to Terry Bean, Donny Ray Williams, Jonathan Gruber and Colleen Bell combined. Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post tried to explain why. Lauren, he claimed, happened in a slow news cycle, though it was the same news cycle as the Williams and Bell stories. He concluded, ""the idea that the key to understanding the Lauten coverage is the media's bias against Republicans just doesn't hold up."" Your mileage on that may vary.

 The ""Eric Garner"" Decision: Truth vs. Ideology

From the rough that is contemporary America, the grand jury that just decided that there were no grounds on which to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner is the second diamond to be retrieved.  The first is the grand jury that refused to indict Officer Darren Wilson for the death of Michael Brown.  Reactions have been predictable.  The misnamed protesters are in reality barbarians for whom such hallmarks of civilization as the rule of law are obstacles to consolidating their power over the rest of us, barbarians, mind you, who block traffic when they arent sending other Americans dreams up in smoke along with their businesses and livelihoods.   Unsurprisingly, the usual suspects in the leftist media have been laboring tirelessly to express their solidarity with the vandals.   More disappointingly, so too have those who should know better, namely those who are often seen as being on the right, both conservatives and libertarians. Indeed, the emoting and presuming emanating from virtually all quarters has reached epic proportions. The facts:  (1)Eric Garner was notwas notkilled because he was selling loose cigarettes.  He died because he was resisting arrest. The officers on the scene used such force as they deemed necessary to subdue him. But, the objectors reply, Garner was only selling cigarettes.  If not for the astronomical taxes that have illegitimately been imposed upon cigarettes, there never wouldve been a black market for the loosies that Garner was peddling.  In other words, while Garner was breaking the law, the law in question was unjust or immoral, for adults should be able to smoke without paying confiscatory tax rates (or something along these lines).   Thus, Garner never should have been confronted by the police. Just recently I argued in this column that recreational and/or other drug use should be decriminalized, that laws designed to save people from themselvese.g. drug lawsare radically antithetical to liberty:  I am the last person from whom one could expect an argument in support of the laws that made Garners trade a crime.  That being said, it is a crime, and, by definition, then, Garner was a criminal, however petty.   The police do not make laws.  Their first duty is to enforce them.  In this case, they were responding to a complaint about Garner, a man who had dozens of arrests already under his belt.  If he felt that he was being hassled or arrested unfairly, then Garner had legal redress via the Civilian Complaint Review Board.  The now retired Bo Dietl, perhaps the most highly decorated police officer and detective in the history of the New York City Police Department, describes the latter as a well-oiled machine [.]   The point is that in resisting arrest rather than fighting it later, the 6-foot-3, 350 pound Garner invited a physical confrontation with the arresting officers.  (2)The officers did not kill Garner with a chokehold.  Officer Pantaleo placed Garner in a headlock, a move that is neither illegal nor in violation of NYPD protocols.  The aggrieved and their accomplices in the press, the self-righteous, are having none of this.  From the time this incident first occurred to the present day, they insist upon mischaracterizing the polices action as a chokehold.   It was no such thing.  However, as Bo Dietl explains: To be a chokehold, there must be constant pressure on a persons neck, compressing his windpipe or cutting off the flow of blood to the carotid artery, rendering him unconscious. Yet it is obvious from the video, as Dietl notes, that the arresting officer put his arm around Garners neck to bring him to the ground [.]  Upon achieving his objective, Garner can be heard while he is already on the ground claiming that he cant breathe.  It was then that the officers called for help. Moreover, Dietl refers to a top medical examiner who confided in him that, given Garners variety of obesity-related health issues, like heart disease and asthma, it was very irresponsible for the Medical Examiners Office to declare Garners death a homicide by chokehold.  (3)The grand jury that chose not to indict Officer Pantaleo on any of the charges on which they couldve indicted him was composed of 23 people.  Nearly two dozen strangers were thrown together for an extended period of time and exposed to mountains of evidence of every conceivable typeincluding the eye witness testimony of the 22 or so people who witnessed the events in question, the video of the confrontation, Officer Pantaleos own testimony, etc.  Only 12 jurors were needed for an indictment to be served.  The prosecutor couldnt even get that.  These strangersas well versed in the facts of the case as anyone, and infinitely more so than most of those now criticizing themconcluded that the facts did not warrant an indictment of any sort.  To this, the only objection, as far as I can determine, is that the grand jury is wrong.  From Al Sharpton to Charles Krauthammer to others of a libertarian bent, with one voice this is their cry.  Its ridiculous.   As even the left-leaning Christian Science Monitor concedes, it is not difficult for prosecutors to secure indictments.  Citing the Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 numbers, it reports that prosecutors sought indictments in approximately 162,000 cases. In all but eleven of these, grand jurors failed to deliver.   In a country that was more devoted to individual liberty, perhaps Eric Garner would still be alive.  And if critics of the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Pantaleo were more devoted to truth, as opposed to their own ideological fantasies, perhaps they would recognize that justice was indeed served.eric garner

The Challenge: Waiting Through Advent

Waiting for peace; hoping for joy; anticipating something wonderful. All of creation waits in earnest for the time of salvation. 
It is this time of year when we think about how the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing since the day a voice shouted in the wilderness, Prepare the way for the Lords coming! Clear the road for him!
John the Baptist - the prophet who baptized men in rivers - proclaimed that the long-awaited Messiah was coming to baptize them with fire. He was born for adventborn to tell the news:
The morning light from heaven is about to break upon us, to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death and to guide us to the path of peace (Luke 1:78-79).
Advent means coming. Good things on the way produce eager expectation and usher in times of preparation. And the season of Advent is about more than counting down days until Christmasit is a readying for the second coming of the One who was, who is, and who is to come. 
The Hope: How to Wait Well
The main purpose of Advent is to train us up in the art of waiting well, which means three things:
1) Wait with correct expectations.
First and foremost, waiting well means knowing who it is youre waiting for. (The entire Christian faith rests in the hope of Jesus return. If it isnt in the forefront of our minds as we live and worship, then what is our faith in, really?) 
John the Baptist recognized Jesus as the Messiah and was able to point others toward him because he knew what to expect. Luke 7:20-23 says:
Johns two disciples found Jesus and said to him, John the Baptist sent us to ask, Are you the Messiah weve been expecting, or should we keep looking for someone else? At that very time, Jesus cured many people of their diseases, illnesses, and evil spirits, and he restored sight to many who were blind. Then he told Johns disciples, Go back to John and tell him what you have seen and heardthe blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is being preached to the poor. And tell him, God blesses those who do not turn away because of me.
When John the Baptists disciples returned with that answer, he had no doubt in his mind that Jesus was the Messiah because he knew exactly what he was looking for, and Jesus fit the bill. 
We, too, are waiting for Jesus. The question is, do we know him well enough to recognize him when he comes again? 
Lets get to know him. Lets spend Advent studying his life and his teachings and the context of it all by digging into the Bible. (The four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, are a great place to start.)
2) Wait with confidence.
Hebrews 11:1 says, Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen, it gives us assurance about things we cannot see. Faith is equated to confidence, and confidence cannot be produced by ignorance. Instead, it is created and strengthened through both concrete and spiritual, yet undeniable, experiences. 
Our confidence grows when we witness miracles or see prayers answered. It grows when we take the time to look back to see how all thingseven the hard thingshave worked together for our good. It grows when we notice the complex intricacies and simple beauties in the world around us. It grows as we learn to recognize Gods hand in our daily lives. 
Confidence can be cultivated. As you practice trusting God with more of your life, your confidence in him and in his promises will grow because his love is unfailing.
3) Wait with joy.
John the Baptist lived his entire life in a state of advent, waiting for Jesus to begin, and to carry out his ministry. John's life was extraordinaryhe wasnt concerned with his own reputation. His only concern was what God was doing in the world through Jesus. He said, I am filled with joy at his success. He must become greater and greater, and I must become less and less (John 3:29-30). 
John the Baptist was joyful because he lived a life in line with the beliefs he professed. He lived according to the calling he was given, which is the same calling we are all given when we believe: to know Christ and to make him known.

Russell Brand and Che Guevara Have Much in Common

Russell Brand and Che Guevara Have Much in Common Former Mr Kate Perry (and current British multi-millionaire-comedian) Russell Brand devotes much of his new book and stage routine to denouncing capitalism. The book itself is titled Revolution and courageously confesses to the following:  Im a big fan of Castro and Che Guevara and all their beret-wearing cigar, gun-totting, cigar-chuffing pals. They were sexy, cool, tough.   Brand is reportedly worth about $9 million so this incongruence between what he practices and what he preaches makes him an easy foil for British conservatives, who ridicule him as a classic champagne socialist. Just this week, for instance, while leading demonstrators for affordable housing in London, Brand threw a tantrum on camera.  A  British reporter (who seemed to take his job title seriously) asked Brand about his own habitation, namely the monthly rent. 'I'm not interested in talking to you about my rent, mate, Brand, who reportedly rents an extremely plush and ritzy bachelor pad, snarled inches from the reporters smiling face. Snides like you, mate, undermine it. Brand added. You're a snide.  Heaven forbid that a smart-mouthed hipster like Brand should encounter actual snideness-- when aimed at himself, that is.   In his vaudeville act Brand doubles-down on his Che-worship by equating Che Guevara with Gandhi and Jesus Christ. Instead Brand should equate Che Guevara (in some respects) with Russell Brand himself. Take these twos mutual hypocrisy regarding crassly capitalistic material perks. Granted, mainstream media disclosures regarding Che Guevara give no hint of any such hypocrisy.  To wit:   Nothing could be more vicariously gratifying than Che Guevaras disdain for material comfort and everyday desires, read Times encomium to Che Guevara in 1999 while hailing him among the Heroes and Icons of the Century, alongside Mother Theresaand, naturally--Gandhi.   Che was aided by a complete freedom from convention or material aspirations. (Philip Bennet, Boston Globe.)""The emblematic impact of Che Guevara is inconceivable without its dimension of sacrifice. Che renounces comfort for an idea."" (Jorge Castaneda, Newsweek) But in fact: Ches house was among the most luxurious in Cuba, wrote Cuban journalist Antonio Llano Montes about the mansion-estate Che Guevara acquired promptly upon entering Havana in January 1959. After a hard day at the office signing firing-squad warrants and blasting teenagers skulls apart with the coup-de-grace from his .45, Che Guevara retired to his new domicile just outside Havana on the pristine beachfront. Until a few weeks prior, it had belonged to Cubas most successful building contractor. Today, the area is reserved exclusively for tourists and Communist party members. The mansion had a boat dock, a huge swimming pool, seven bathrooms, a sauna, a massage salon and several television sets, continued Llano Montes. One TV had been specially designed in the U.S., and had a screen ten feet wide and was operated by remote control. This was thought to be the only TV of its kind in Latin America. The mansions garden had a veritable jungle of imported plants, a pool with a waterfall, ponds filled with exotic tropical fish and several bird houses filled with parrots and other exotic birds. The habitation was something out of A Thousand and One Nights. The austere idealist, Che Guevara, hadnt done too badly for himself in this real estate acquisition (read: hand over all your property, Mr. Cuban contractor, or face a firing squad.) Not content with hailing Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, Russell Brand seeks to dazzle us with his erudition on Cuban history. Apparently hes up to snuff on all the slogans and bumper-stickers. To wit:   Until the Revolution the U.S. ran Cuba as a virtual colony, he writes. Batista was a corrupt U.S. puppet. But Humberto? Some readers ask. Why bother? Why are you preparing to factually debunk the ravings of a jack-*ass like Russell Brand?   Because Brands idiocies on Cuba perfectly mirror the enlightened, even the mainstream, version of Cuban history, however amazing and asinine it sounds to actual Cubans who lived it or to any person who bothers to investigate the issue beyond what issues from Castros agents of influence, on the payroll and off.  In brief, you hear and read the identical KGB-concocted buncombe everywhere from The History Channel to PBS, to Jon Stewart to U.S. Democratic Presidents. Lets take John F. Kennedy as exhibit A. Heres an excerpt from an interview the most popular U.S. president in modern history (according to Gallup polls) granted journalist Jean Daniel on October, 24th, 1963: ""I believe that there is no country in the world, including any and all the countries under colonial domination, where economic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my countrys policies during the Batista regimeI will even go further: to some extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the U.S. Now we shall have to pay for those sins. Kennedy was describing a nation with a higher per capita income than half of Europe, the lowest inflation rate in the Western Hemisphere, the 13th lowest infant-mortality on earth and a huge influx of immigrants. Crazier still, in 1959 U.S. investments in Cuba accounted for only 14 per cent the islands GNP, and. U.S. owned companies employed only 7 per cent of Cuba's workforce. Now regarding that U.S.-backed Batista:  Me and my staff were all Fidelistas, boasted Robert Reynolds, the CIAs Caribbean Desks specialist on the Cuban Revolution from 1957-1960.  Everyone in the CIA and everyone at State was pro-Castro, except (Republican) ambassador Earl Smith. (CIA operative in Santiago Cuba 195759, Robert Weicha.) ""Without U.S. help Fidel Castro would never have gotten into power, flatly testified former U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Earl T. Smith during Congressional testimony in 1960. But no alternative media was around in 1963 to rub Kennedys face in the KGB-hatched and media-spread propaganda he was echoing as gospel. Instead the Communist-hatched lies were accepted as truths by millions of often well-meaning Americans who the liberal media monopoly of the time had rendered none the wiser. In brief, Russell Brand is simply echoing the sentiments of the most popular U.S. president in modern history. Sad but true. So lets hand it to the KGB. Their propaganda confections about Cuba became script for comedian moonbats but also for liberals, moderates, and indeed, The Best and Brightest.

WASHINGTON -- The Democrats, who were in serious condition after being battered, bloodied and beaten in the midterm elections, are now on the critical list
Hillary Clinton, the party's frontrunner for the 2016 presidential nomination, is receiving poor reviews for her performance on the stump, speaking to a half-empty hall at Georgetown University this week. Words like ""banal"" and ""bureaucratic"" were used to describe her vacuous, messageless, issue-light speech.
At the same time, some Democrats are sensing that the former first lady and secretary of state is an empty suit, with little, if any, executive abilities behind her overinflated resume. She still has not addressed economic issues and jobs in any substantive way, despite the fact that Election Day exit polls showed they were the voters' top concerns.
Clinton may still be brushing up on the subject after her embarrassing gaffe at a Democratic Party campaign rally in Massachusetts when she said, ""Don't let anybody tell you that it's corporations and businesses that create jobs.""
After that eye-rolling blunder, more Democrats have begun thinking about challenging her for their party's nod. One of them is former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia. He sharply criticized his party this week, warning that the Democrats have lost their message, ""lost white working-class voters"" and ""turned into a party of interest groups.""
Also this week, Democrats pulled the plug on the campaign of one of their last senatorial survivors, currently clinging precariously to life pending Saturday's runoff election. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has dropped plans to buy TV ads in a last-ditch effort to save three-term Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, the Deep South's last Democratic senator. GOP Congressman Bill Cassidy was expected to win the seat, further strengthening his party's hold on the Senate.
As in last month's elections, President Obama was clearly to blame for Landrieu's downfall.
 ""Senator Landrieu represents Barack Obama. I represent you,"" Cassidy said in their final debate Monday.
But there was still more bad news for Democrats this week, arising out of their catastrophic election losses. A Gallup poll found that Americans now view the Republicans more favorably and that their ""political allegiances have shifted toward"" the GOP.
Before the elections, 43 percent of Americans identified with or leaned toward the Democrats, while 39 percent said they identified or leaned toward the GOP.
""Since then, Republicans have opened up a slight advantage, 42 percent to 41 percent, representing a net shift of five percentage points in the partisan gap,"" Gallup said.
 ""Americans are also now more likely to align themselves politically with the Republican Party than the Democratic Party,"" the pollsters said.
With the Democrats now in the minority on Capitol Hill, the Republicans are losing no time in taking the reins of power as they carve out their legislative agenda for the new Congress next year.
 In the GOP-run House Wednesday, their focus quickly turned to the economy. Dozens of individual and business tax breaks were passed by the House with a lopsided 378-46 vote of approval. Those will allow businesses and individual taxpayers to claim deductions on their 2014 tax returns for research and development, business investment and expansion, energy and more. It is expected to pass the Senate next week.
Meanwhile, over at the White House, Obama and his staff were said to be reaching out to Democratic leaders in Congress -- something he has shown little interest in doing in the last six years.
With his so-called Affordable Care Act threatened with dismantlement by Republicans, and annual budgets likely to be tighter than they were when Reid and Pelosi ruled the roost, Democrats say they're suddenly getting a lot of phone calls from the West Wing.
House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland says he's been getting calls from Obama. ""I've seen heightened outreach,"" he told The Washington Post. ""To some degree we've become more relevant than we were before. Now he needs to rely on both houses to sustain a veto,"" Hoyer said.
But insiders say there is still bad blood in Democratic ranks on the Hill among members who blame Obama for their crushing losses last month and aren't eager to stick their political necks out for him in the legislative battles to come. That view essentially boils down to, ""Yeah, you need us now, but why weren't you protecting us when we needed some political cover?""
Suddenly, Obama has begun talking about legislative issues like tax reform and trade expansion -- issues that Obama gave only grudging lip service to in the past six years. There he was on Wednesday, in a sea of CEOs from the nation's biggest corporations -- at a conference sponsored by the Business Roundtable -- talking up trade deals and tax reform.
Yet for six years, the administration dragged its feet on trade agreements to open markets for U.S. exports when the sluggish, underperforming economy needed it most. The chief reason: opposition from labor union bosses, who exerted their own veto at the White House. When the AFL-CIO barked, Obama saluted.
After the beating he was given on Nov. 4, the president seems to be more open to tax reform, but we've heard this song before. The 35 percent top corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the industrialized world, is a job killer. His capital gains tax hike has weakened business investment, the source of all new jobs.
 Obama burned his bridges with a go-it-alone presidency, and now he thinks he can paper over the damage. But it's a little late for that. He's lost whatever capital he may have had in Congress and with the American people, including many in his own party.

Landrieu is a household name in Louisiana. A Southern, conservative Democratic stronghold for generations, the Gulf States have edged toward the GOP since the mid-1990s, when Bill Clinton made fiscal discipline a national value, yet his party failed to follow suit. Still standing true on American values, limited government, and individual liberty, Southern Democrats felt less welcome in their party, and started moving to the GOP.  Except for US Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who has had it pretty easy in the Big Easy. A staunch defender of the oil industry, a reliable provider of federal earmarks, she flew out in full force for her state during Hurricane Katrina.  In 2014, however, the voters will not turn out for her. Not this year. Not this time. Even though she survived to the December 6th run-off , two major Republican challengers with their combined votes more than top whatever she garnered November Fourth. Of course, the National Republican Senate Committee has left nothing to chances. But they certainly have de la chance [good luck] this year. Republicans have all the factors on their side, and the conservative who did win the run-off, Bill Cassidy, will be the next US Senator From Louisiana.   What happened to the Democratic franchise in the Pelican State, and Landrieu in particular, that even the three-term incumbent loved by both sides of the aisle is struggling so badly this year? One word: Obama.  This President has so ruined the Democratic brand's national appeal, he has undone the former DNC Chairman's Fifty-State Strategy, that Southern white Democrats will become a figment of political history.  The senator went along to get along from 2008 to 2014, forced to vote ""Yea"" on Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, and every other Big Government agenda one can think of. The President's vision of government-controlled health care, plus his aggravated push to redefine marriage, expand poverty programs (and poverty with it), along with his pro-abortion stance, which have pushed Landrieu further to the left. After six years, the Lady from LA cannot run from a record so contrary to Louisiana values.  Even her claims of senatorial seniority have fallen on deaf ears, especially among her colleagues. The most influential Democrats in the upper chamber are clamoring for climate change, an agenda hostile to carbon exploration and distribution, i.e. Louisiana residents and businesses. In a last ditch effort to save her seat, Majority Leader Harry Reid submitted the long-delayed Keystone Pipeline extension to a floor vote, which lost by one vote.  Now, Landrieu is her worst enemy, castigating her own voters as racist and sexist:  Ill be very honest with you. The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans. Its been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader.  She apparently forgot that President Obama won Virginia and Florida twice, along with North Carolina in 2008, all of which are Southern states. While she paints the South as a bastion of racist animus, Landrieu ignores that two Southern states have Indian-American governors: Bobby Jindal of her home-state Louisiana, and Nikki Haley of South Carolina. The first black male US Senator since Reconstruction is in South Carolina, too, Tim Scott, who just won reelection this year.  And sexist too?   It's not always been a good place for women to present ourselves. It's more of a conservative place, so we've had to work a little harder on that. Landrieu should take a long look in the mirror, and recall that Louisiana voters sent a white women to Washington during Presidential and off-election years for nearly two decades. Here's a comprehensive list of female legislators in Louisiana, and he is a list providing the data on female legislators throughout the country.  Yet there may be more to the allegation that the South, particularly black voters, are not friendly to the President. Landrieu neglected to mention that the President's policies have heightened racial tensions, job-killing regulations, and union-friendly restrictions on school choice. President Obama's stance on individual liberty and religious expression has driven many blacks in the South to the GOP for the last four years, including councilmembers in Georgia, former Congressman from Alabama Artur Davis, and Louisiana state senate Elbert Guillory, along with state legislators in Missouri, and West Virginia.  On December Sixth, Landrieus defeat will be the capstone on Republican victories across the country, national repudiation of President Obama aggressive, progressive agenda, and the demise of the Southern Democrat as a political force. As for Landrieu, she has no one to blame but herself, and her President, for the terrible outcome she faces. To put it glibly, she is French toast. Laissez les bons temps rouler!

What the UVA Rape Case Reveals

Rolling Stone magazine and its reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely are facing a great deal of skepticism about a story called ""A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and Struggle for Justice at UVA."" The article tells the story of ""Jackie,"" a University of Virginia student who says she was gang raped at a fraternity party early in her freshman year.There are solid journalistic reasons to question Erdely's reporting. She failed, as Slate and others have objected, to get any statements from the accused, while offering feeble and conflicting accounts about why -- first saying the young men were hard to find, and then explaining that the victim was uncomfortable about having them contacted. Richard Bradley, a former editor of George magazine who's seen hoaxes, urges skepticism about this story because it fits a little too neatly into a preferred leftist narrative: southern college, white fraternity boys and the campus rape culture. Fair enough. Others recall the panting eagerness of the press (and members of the faculty at Duke) to believe the worst about the lacrosse players.As someone who believes that campus rape is a genuine problem, I found some aspects of the Rolling Stone tale not credible. The young woman claims, for example, that she was pushed into a glass table that smashed beneath her and then gang raped by seven students on cut glass. She says she then stumbled from the frat house bleeding and disheveled, yet her friends discouraged her from going to the hospital because it might quash their plans to rush at fraternities. Without knowing more, it's impossible to say what the truth is about this woman's experience -- though I imagine something traumatic happened to her. But if, for whatever reason, we learn that all or part of her story isn't true, it should not be seen as some grand refutation of the problem of rape. ""If false, Rolling Stone story could set rape victims back decades,"" headlined the Washington Examiner. Why?Tawana Brawley was found to be lying, but her dishonesty didn't invalidate every rape claim in America. The left likes to put people in categories: women, good; men, bad. Black inner-city residents, good; white police, bad. Environmentalists, honest; businessmen, liars. And on it goes. For a time, when the nation was gripped by an epidemic of child abuse hysteria, we were told that ""children never lie"" about these things, even as coached tots were telling tales of being sexually abused in spaceships with samurai swords. The left will have its fables, whatever the strain on logic and common sense.We don't need ""Jackie"" to be honest to know that campus rape is real. We have reports throughout the nation, lawsuits, complaints and word of mouth. One study put the number of sexual assaults at 100,000 a year, which may be high, but good data is elusive for crimes that nearly always entail he said/she said and are accompanied by shame.Certainly the activists' demand that campuses handle these cases without traditional protections for the accused -- such as the right to confront witnesses or be represented by counsel -- represents a gross retreat from constitutional principles, and it's a separate scandal that many colleges are doing just that. But neither should we dismiss these reports as simply the result of ""post-sex regrets"" by young women.For centuries, western civilization recognized that women were vulnerable to sexual violence and abuse. Painstakingly, we erected a complex architecture of mores and laws to protect women from the worst kinds of men. Some of those protections now seem ridiculous -- such as the notion that a lady would never permit herself to be alone with a strange man, not even in an elevator. But no one should be surprised that when the guardrails of sexual behavior were swept away in the flood of the sexual revolution, predatory men were handed a golden opportunity. A 2002 study by David Lisak of the University of Massachusetts and Paul Miller of the Brown University School of Medicine found that 90 percent of rapes on college campuses are committed by serial offenders. A small percentage of men are committing most of the crimes.There is a rape culture -- it's the hook-up culture that the left invented and celebrated as liberation. Until it's reversed, the rapes will continue.

Even Advocates of Past Governments Shutdowns Advise Extreme Caution This Time

In years past, this column has urged conservative Republicans in Congress to shut down the federal government as a way to counter some of the hardline policies and stare down some of the more uncompromising positions taken by President Obama.But the current row that's brewing among congressional Republicans is a different matter. Debate is raging about a proposed continuing resolution to fund the government, instead of passing a regular budget that would allow new funding for the assimilation of millions of illegal immigrants. This potential GOP strategy could easily turn growing support for the Republicans into opposition. Don't get me wrong. The president's use of executive orders as a way to sidestep Congress and its constitutional role of lawmaking -- in this case to decree amnesty for illegal aliens -- is every bit a justification for shutting down the normal budget process. Those who advocate a short extension of the current federal budget, along with a substantial cut in the budget of the Department of Homeland Security, have a justified legal and moral case for their position. If Republicans don't live up to the rhetoric that returned them to control of the House and won a majority in the Senate, they will risk the appearance of being toothless tigers who are willing to say anything to win an election.I get all of that. In fact, I agree with their position: The president -- any president -- should not go unchallenged when he tries to bypass his constitutional authority by unilaterally decreeing laws. But I have been down this shutdown road before with the man who first ""paved"" it, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich. That experience taught me that there is a huge difference between winning a battle and winning the war. In this case, the battle is the one over executive amnesty, but the war could be winning the presidency in 2016, as well as retaining majority control of the Senate. (Given the particular Senate seats up for contention in two years, that could be a taller order for the GOP than many think.) It would be great to cut off funds to federal agencies and departments that are helping to implement ""laws"" that were never passed by Congress. And support for both Obamacare and amnesty are weak right now. But waiting on the sidelines is an elite media that is salivating over the prospect of a government shutdown. They know these shutdowns never get the support of the critically important independent and swing voters. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has joined a group of conservative House members that is demanding a very short period of time for any continuing resolution that would fund the federal government. Cruz is a dedicated conservative member of the Senate, but his motives for pushing another potential shutdown are more likely centered around his own potential run for president in 2016. Ironically, if he were to get his way, a shutdown would most assuredly take place, and Cruz would find his electability as a potential presidential nominee ruined.That's a shame, because what Barack Obama needs is a swift kick in his posterior from Congress. It skirts the very essence of our Constitution's spirit of a balance of power for the president to arrogantly abuse the use of regulations and executive orders to implement policy that is opposed by both a majority of Americans and by the Republican-majority Congress that will be seated in January.But it would be a political catastrophe to try to pull off a shutdown before new members of the House and Senate even learn a little bit about how things work in their respective chambers. It would look like overreach -- political showboating. And it would be used as fodder by the liberal media in the 2016 elections.There are other ways to dismantle at least some of the damage President Obama has done. But it will take careful planning by congressional Republicans to implement any meaningful countermeasures to the president's policies. It's true that the Gingrich shutdown in the '90s actually forced then-President Bill Clinton to push for more conservative policies than he otherwise would have. But Clinton was a more reasonable and pragmatic Democratic president than Obama is.Sadly, necessarily, this is one shutdown that we need to let pass by.Matt Towery is author of the book ""Paranoid Nation: The Real Story of the 2008 Fight for the Presidency.""

Should There Have Been Charges Filed In The Eric Garner Case?

The past few weeks have not been kind to law enforcement. Grand juries from Ferguson, Missouri and Staten Island, New York decided not to file charges against Officer Darren Wilson in Missouri and the officers involved in the death of Eric Garner in New York. 
While the officers in both cases have been cleared, its been a public relations nightmare for police. Unlike Ferguson, there is video evidence of the events that led to Eric Garners deathand its horrifying to watch.

The 22-person Staten Island grand jury (13 to 14 members being white and nine to 10 being black or Hispanic) reviewed the case for more four monthsand heard testimony from 22 witnesses.
The medical examiner ruled that Eric Garners deathwas a homicide, citing the chokehold and compression of the chest as the cause of death; Garners obesity, high blood pressure, and asthma were listed as contributing factors as well.
Concerning the chokehold, its a move thats been prohibited by the New York Police Department since 1993, but its not illegal (via New York Observer):
Chokeholds may be prohibited by the NYPD rule book, but they arent actually illegal  and Councilman Rory Lancman is looking to change that.
But he wont find support from Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, who said today he doesnt believe its necessary to criminalize the highly controversial procedure that a medical examiner ruled caused the death of Eric Garner, 43, in police custody.
Would you support legislation that would make it illegal for an officer or anyone to perform this incredibly dangerous maneuver? Mr. Lancman asked Mr. Bratton during a Council hearing today.
I would not, Mr. Bratton answered shortly.
Why not? Mr. Lancman asked.
I feel that department policies are sufficient. But if lawmakers want to try to make that against the law, good luck, but I wont support it, Mr. Bratton said.
The exchange came after Mr. Bratton previously objected to Councilman Corey Johnson calling chokeholds illegal in a question about why so few officers had been punished for allegations of using the maneuver  banned by NYPD rules since 1993.
Chokeholds are not illegal. They are not against the law, Mr. Bratton noted.
Mr. Lancman tweeted about Mr. Brattons remark, adding the hashtag: #ivegotabillforthat.
Also, unlike Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, the police officer who put Garner in a chokehold, Daniel Pantaleo, has had civil rights lawsuits filed against himtwice (viaNew York Magazine):
The Staten Island Advance reports that Pantaleo has been sued twice for violating the civil rights of people he's arrested. In the first case, two men  Darren Collins and Tommy Rice  said that Pantaleo and another officer strip-searched them on a Staten Island street, in the middle of the day, after pulling them over. According to the 2012 lawsuit, Pantaleo and his colleague handcuffed Collins and Rice and then ""pulled down the plaintiffs' pants and underwear, and touched and searched their genital areas, or stood by while this was done in their presence.""
Later, at the 120th Precinct station, Pantaleo and a third cop strip-searched the men again. Collins and Rice's lawyer, Jason Leventhal, told the Advance that Pantaleo had lied about seeing crack and heroin in their vehicle, which is how he was able to arrest them. Leventhal's clients (one of whom was carrying crack, though not, as Pantaleo claimed, in plain view) ended up with criminal charges that were eventually dismissed. Meanwhile, New York City shelled out $30,000 to settle the lawsuit.
The details of the second lawsuit, which is still pending, are a bit unclear. 
The Advance reports that a man named Rylawn Walker sued Pantaleo this past winter for arresting him even though he was ""committing no crime at that time and was not acting in a suspicious manner."" Walker, who faced marijuana charges that were later thrown out, also claims that Pantaleo ""misrepresented facts in the police reports and other documents that the plaintiff had committed offenses when in fact this was not true.""
Yet, the article also mentioned that the odds that Pantaleo losing his job, or being suspended, are ""slim,"" although he has been reassigned since the Garner case.
Pantaleo testified to the grand jury, saying he meant no harm when trying to arrest Mr. Garner on the suspicion of selling illegal cigarettes (viaNYT):
The officer tackled some of the most damaging evidence head-on. He acknowledged that he heard Mr. Garner saying, I cant breathe, I cant breathe, and insisted that he tried to disengage as quickly as he could, according to his lawyer, Stuart London. At the same time, Mr. Garners ability to speak, the officer testified, suggested that he, in fact, could breathe.

His testimony, on Nov. 21, seems to have swayed the grand jurors who, on Wednesday, decided not to charge him with a crime. But the officers testimony, as recounted by Mr. London [Stuart London, Pantaleo's attorney], seemed at times to be at odds with a video of the encounter, such as his stated attempt to get off Mr. Garner as quick as he could.

He testified that the glass buckled while Garner was up against him and he was against the glass, Mr. London said. He was concerned that both he and Garner would go through that glass.
On the video, the men toppled to the ground, but the arm around Mr. Garners neck did not appear to move. Officer Pantaleo told jurors he continued to hold on to Mr. Garner as he struggled to regain his balance, Mr. London said. He said he wanted to make sure that Mr. Garner was not injured by other officers rushing in, as well as to prevent Mr. Garner from possibly biting one of them.
The most brutal part of the video is the one shot after officers had subdued Garner; he lays there motionless on the sidewalk. When EMTs arrive, not a single one performs CPR on Garner. The fallout led to thembeingsuspended without pay. Yet, it appears that Garner is still alive, as one of the EMTs feels his neck to find a pulse; Garner would die about an hour later.

Now, with Ferguson, the physical evidence seemed to have corroborated Officer Wilsons account of the events that led to him shooting Michael Brown; Dorian Johnson, the man who was with Brown at the time of the incident, plead guilty tofiling a false police reportin 2011, and there were numerous instances where testimonies by the witnesses were ""inconsistent, fabricated, or provably wrong."" Oh, and the autopsy foundno bullet wounds in Michael Browns back. 
With Garner, well, Ill just let Allahpunditsay it:
In key ways, though, the two incidents were different: The killing of Eric Garner was caught on video; Garner didnt put the cops in fear for their lives; and the chokehold used by Officer Daniel Pantaleo that killed Garner, who was asthmatic (youll hear him wheezing I cant breathe repeatedly in the clip), is banned under the NYPDs own guidelines. Pantaleo was stripped of his gun and put on desk duty after the incident as a preliminary punishment. This summer, a Quinnipiac poll found that 64 percent of New Yorkers thought he should face some kind of charges for Garners death.
The Eric Garner murder is pretty much slam-dunk second-degree manslaughter at the very least. But hey: Two Americas. pic.twitter.com/ll6apG3CIO Sean Davis (@seanmdav) December 3, 2014 Sean Davis, co-founder of The Federalist, says that the threshold for Pantaleo to be charged with second-degree manslaughter was a slam-dunk."" The use of the banned chokehold move shows that the NYPD knew the move wasreckless, hence fitting with the charge at handand it only takes a simple majority to indict.
Additionally, Reasons Nick Gillespie makes a good point that perhaps we should reform the laws that led to Garners death, particularlygovernment taxes on cigarettes:
Yet clearly something has gone horribly wrong when a man lies dead after being confronted for selling cigarettes to willing buyers. Especially since, as even Bratton has acknowledged, the chokehold applied by the restraining officer is prohibited by the NYPDs own rulebook. Does the commissioner really control his officers, and is it time to rethink nanny state policies that create flourishing underground markets?
The combination of an unruly and disobedient people, an excess of small rules, and a willingness to enforce the law can be disastrous. Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) December 4, 2014 
People saying, Europe has taxes, but this doesnt happen: 1) Europeans dont enforce their minor laws well; 2) Americans are more unruly. Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) December 4, 2014 
The state is force. This is another good example of why there should be few laws, and why that force should be used in few circumstances. Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) December 3, 2014 
Gillespie noted that while New Yorks taxes on cigarettes has gone up 150 percent; smuggling has also increased 59 percent.
What is a little troubling is the conservative reaction to defend the police immediately after such cases like these break on the news. As A.J. Delgaldo wrote inNational Review last summer, using the Garnercase as a prime example; its time for conservatives unconditional love affair with the police to end:An e-mailer just told me to pipe down about Eric Garner since the head of the police union said everything was legit. Best one today by far. Sean Davis (@seanmdav) December 4, 2014 
Lets get the obligatory disclaimer out of the way: Yes, many police officers do heroic works and, yes, many are upstanding individuals who serve the community bravely and capably.
But respecting good police work means being willing to speak out against civil-liberties-breaking thugs who shrug their shoulders after brutalizing citizens.
On Thursday in Staten Island, an asthmatic 43-year-old father of six, Eric Garner, died after a group of policemen descended on him, placing him in a chokehold while attempting to arrest him for allegedly selling cigarettes. A bystander managed to capture video in which Garner clearly cries out, I cant breathe! Even after releasing the chokehold (chokeholds, incidentally, are prohibited by NYPD protocol), the same officer then proceeds to shove and hold Garners face against the ground, applying his body weight and pressure on Garner, ignoring Garners pleas that he cannot breathe. Worse yet, new video shows at least eight officers standing around Garners lifeless, unconscious body.
Who can defend this?
And police-department Internal Affairs divisions are nearly as concerning as the cops themselves. Last week, a Miami police officer witnessed a car driving at high speeds in a pedestrian area. When he pulled the car over, the indignant driver stormed out. Dont you know the [expletive] I am? the driver barked. It turns out that the driver was a police lieutenant within . . . Internal Affairs. The department in charge of ensuring proper police behavior consists of gents like this, whose first response is to assume that cops, like members of Congress, are above the law. What happened to the lieutenant? He has been transferred to Special Investigations, which, as a local NBC reporter points out, is more a promotion than a punishment.
Police wrongly entering private property with no right to do so and causing death? Check! Last month, an officer in Utah, while searching for a three-year-old reported missing by his family (he was later found hiding in his own homes basement), took it upon himself to enter the private backyard of a neighborhood home without a warrant  in clear violation of the homeowners Fourth Amendment rights (officers are only allowed to chuck the warrant requirement if a crime is occurring where time is of the essence). The officer  who had about as much courage as I did in gym class  was approached by the homeowners dog and, rather than retreat or fire at the dogs leg, shot the dog point-blank in the head. The reaction of the Salt Lake City Police Department was to defend the officer, claiming he had a right to shoot as he was in fear for his life, and made no mention of why the officer entered private property without a warrant in the first place. Anyone who believes in upholding the Constitution should be outraged. Next time, it can just as easily be a young boy who points a toy gun at an officer, a confused elderly person, or even you.
Last month in Georgia, a SWAT teams flash grenade landed in a baby boys crib. Worth noting: It was even the wrong house.
The Staten Island DA could establish another grand jury to look at the evidence again, but for now; the Department of Justice isopening a civil rights investigationand Garners family is most certainly going to file a lawsuit with the city and the NYPD.
At the same time, we still don't know the charges that were brought before the grand jury to consider.
I hope we get some reporting - which I haven't seen so far - on what charges were requested in Garner case, despite GJ secrecy rules. Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) December 3, 2014 
I don't like Eric Holder, and in general don't approve of Feds doubling up, but the Eric Garner case merits it. This needs a U.S. Attorney. Popehat (@Popehat) December 3, 2014 


But, there's this:
There's also nothing, aside from just not wanting to, preventing a NY court from empaneling another grand jury. It's not just in DA's hands. Sean Davis (@seanmdav) December 4, 2014

Clinton's Stock Declining in Futures Market

Is the market in Hillary Clinton futures collapsing? Quite possibly so.A year ago Clinton seemed likely to become the next president. Presumably she and her husband had not yet started to call themselves, Bush style, 42 and 45. But she had an overwhelming lead in the polls for the Democratic nomination and was getting 50 percent or more in most polls against possible Republican candidates in general election pairings.Ratings of Clinton's performance as secretary of state were positive. She seemed poised to hold and add onto Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 majorities.Things look different now. Obama now gets negative marks on foreign policy, and some of the luster is off Clinton's record as well. With the Islamic State ravaging much of Iraq and Syria, the decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq looks dubious. With Vladimir Putin's Russia rampaging through much of Ukraine, Clinton's reset button looks ludicrous.Most Americans may have been content with a foreign policy of ""leading from behind."" But as the world spins out of control, they don't like the results.And over the course of 2014, Clinton's favorability ratings have declined. Her memoir of her Cabinet service had a curiously defensive title -- ""Hard Choices"" -- and her book tour was something like the opposite of a ringing success. Sales were slim, and readership probably even slimmer. The prospect of a Clinton presidency may thrill a few aging feminists, but few others seem to find her very interesting.There's plenty of bad news for Clinton in last month's Quinnipiac poll, the first national survey conducted since the November election. Clinton runs 1 point behind Mitt Romney, 1 point ahead of Chris Christie, 4 points ahead of Paul Ryan and 5 points ahead of Jeb Bush, Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee. None of this can be blamed on low off-year turnout; the poll is of registered voters.All these Republicans except Romney are significantly less well known than Clinton. When asked whether their feelings are favorable or unfavorable, only 5 percent of poll respondents have no opinion on Clinton and 14 percent on Romney; the numbers for the other Republicans run between 29 and 39 percent. So she's running even with the best-known candidate while the others all have room to grow.Even more significant are Clinton's percentages against these candidates: 44, 45, 46, 46, 46 and 46. In seriously contested 2014 Senate races, Democratic incumbents tended to run about even with their poll numbers, while their Republican challengers ran well ahead of theirs. If you apply the same rule to Clinton's Quinnipiac numbers, she ends up with about the same percentage as John McCain in 2008 or Democratic House candidates in 2010 and 2014.Now, things may be different by 2016. Obama's job approval could rise, and Democrats generally could regain the advantage over Republicans they enjoyed a year ago. Increased economic growth could strengthen the incumbent party -- although, as RealClearPolitics.com analyst Sean Trende points out, even significantly greater growth would not point to a Democratic victory under most political scientists' election prediction formulas.But it's hard to avoid the conclusion of FiveThirtyEight analyst Harry Enten. Clinton, he wrote last Monday, ""no longer looks like such a juggernaut. Not only are her numbers dropping, but she is running on par with a Democratic brand in its weakest shape in a decade.""That's not what optimistic Democrats were expecting earlier this year. They thought nostalgia for Bill Clinton's presidency would enable Hillary Clinton to run ahead of party lines. Voters not eager for a third Obama term might welcome a third Clinton term.But those are appeals that look to the past. Voters expect presidential candidates to look to the future. Hillary Clinton has wide leads in polls for the Democratic nomination. But her record is a bad fit for the Democratic primary electorate in which the energy currently comes from the left. Lurching to the left and then tacking toward the center doesn't project a clear vision of the future.In 1991, candidate Bill Clinton gave three policy speeches to overflow crowds at Georgetown University's Gaston Hall. When Hillary Clinton spoke there last week, the balcony was almost empty and there were empty seats in the lower level, too.Clinton futures were on the rise 23 years ago. They seem to be in decline 23 years later.

Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran:The presidents of Iran, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan attended a ceremony at Etrek on the Iran-Turkmenistan border on 3 December to mark the completion of the final 32km section of a 914km north-south railway linking the three countries east of the Caspian Sea. An agreement was signed by the presidents of the three countries in 2007 and construction began in 2009. The 146km section of the route from Uzen, Kazakhstan, to the Turkmen border was the first section of the route to be completed in 2012. The 82km Iranian section from Gorgan north to the Turkmenistan border opened last year. The line is 1520mm-gauge as far as Etrek, with the Iranian section of the route being standard gauge.  Comment:The new line is part of the International North-South Transport Corridor which links India by ship and rail to Europe, via Iran and Russia. According to the professional railroad blogs, this is Kazakhstan's first direct rail link to Iran and, ultimately, the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. A transportation revolution is emerging in central and eastern Asia. One major effect of new railroad construction is that new lines enable land locked central Asian countries to use Indian Ocean ports. They also enable Asian countries to avoid international chokepoints including the Suez Canal and the Malacca and Singapore Straits, by using rail lines to Indian Ocean ports for exports and imports. Another characteristic of the central Asian lines is that China is the eastern terminus of many of them. Almost all new central Asian railroads lead to China, whose rail construction initiatives are more successful and durable than Chinese diplomacy. The rail lines reduce Chinese dependence on maritime shipping that must transit chokepoints that the US Navy easily can control. These projects are a tribute to Chinese long term strategic planning for crisis or war management. Ukraine:On 2 December, President Plotnitsky of the Luhansk Peoples Republic said that his self-proclaimed republic ""has no major victories on the diplomatic front yet."" He confirmed the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observers' report which stated the Luhansk People's Republic and the Ukrainian government have agreed on the strict observance of the ceasefire agreement and a pullout of heavy armaments from the disengagement line. The agreement emerged from consultations within the framework of the Joint Center for Control and Coordination of the Ceasefire, held in Luhansk on 29 November. Comment:The Russian general mentioned in last night'sNightWatchis General Lieutenant Olexander Lentsov. He is a member of the Russian delegation to the Joint Center, which became operational on 27 September. It is a joint OSCE, Russian, Ukrainian and separatists entity, one of whose primary missions is to demarcate the ceasefire lines. Its significance is that it provides a legal basis for Russia to shape and oversee the implementation of theceasefire. The Joint Center puts the Russians in a position to judge the effects of their own meddling in eastern Ukraine. Libya:Libya's recognized interim government issued a statement on 3 December 2014 confirming that forces known as the Libyan National Army led by Major General Khalifah Haftar/Hifter are advancing towards Tripoli, and are now positioned on its outskirts, according to Libyan press. The statement said that the aim of the operation is ""to root out armed groups, outside of the state's control, who seized control of the city by force of arms and occupied the legitimate government's headquarters."" The statement also accused armed groups of ""terrorizing the residents of the city, where kidnappings, assassinations, raids and attacks are rife."" The statement made an example of a series of ""systematic"" assassinations of Libyan air force officers that were similar to assassinations of officers across all military and air force ranks in Benghazi during the last few years. The government vowed to assure the safety of all those who lay down their weapons and surrender, emphasizing that they would be treated in a humane manner, in line with the law. The statement added that government would not target individuals, regardless of their affiliations, but warned that those ""who put the lives of innocent citizens at risk and damage public or private property"" would be dealt with ""forcefully."" The government called on the Libyan army to take the ""necessary measures to guarantee the safety of civilian residents of Tripoli, safeguard public buildings and institutions and private property."" The statement addressed the ""true revolutionaries who support legitimacy across Libya"", calling on them to ""prepare themselves to do their patriotic duty by assisting the army"" in securing their neighborhoods and protecting institutions, diplomatic buildings and private and public property.  Comment:Hifter's primary area of operation has been Benghazi in eastern Libya, rather than Tripoli. Today's announcement implies that Hifter has agreed to shift focus to Tripoli to support the interim government that is exiled in Tobruk. This would represent a major tactical shift that must include support from Libyan army and tribal fighting groups in western Libya. Hifter has no known tribal support in the Tripoli area, but tribal allegiances change. The statement also could be somewhat exaggerated. Nevertheless, it restates the interim government's determination to return to Tripoli as the national government. It also strongly endorses Hifter as the leader of the loyalist forces. This might be the best chance for restoring a national government in Libya. The western tribes will switch loyalty if they sense a winner has arrived, just as they did when they abandoned Qadhafi.

Exoneration: Democrat-Led 'Bridgegate' Investigation Clears Christie of Wrongdoing

Three investigations, three vindications for Chris Christie. The 'Bridgegate' scandal sucked up apreposterous amount ofmedia oxygen last year, as Democrats and the press fixated on the closure of several lanes on the George Washington Bridge for a few days inSeptember 2013. What did the governor know, and when did he know it? Christie immediately asserted that he had absolutely no knowledge of the hair-brained scheme, apologized for his administration's actions, andfired those responsible. Here's what I said at the time:

Simple. If Christie cleans house & is telling the truth about his own knowledge, he's fine. If he's not being fully honest, he's in trouble. Guy Benson (@guypbenson) January 9, 2014




Since that day, which touched off a months-long feeding frenzy that damaged Christie'spolitical standing,three investigations were launched into the matter: The governor ordered an internal review(led by a team of former federal prosecutors), the US attorney's office probed whether any criminal charges might be warranted, and Democrats in Trenton appointed a stacked panel to investigate. The lattercommission, which wasled by a prominentChristie opponent and hardcore partisan,would have liked nothing more than to nail the governor to the wall. How did this triumverate of investigations turn out? Christie's own probeconfirmed his story, prompting howls of skepticism from critics. Of course it cleared him. The governor nevertheless predicted that its conclusions would ""stand the test of time,"" acknowledging that it would be ""tested by the other investigations that are ongoing."" And they have been. NBC News reported in September that the federal inquiry had ""uncovered no information he either knew in advance or directed the closure of traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge."" The last, best hope for anti-Christie crusaders was the legislative review -- whichwasn't gaining much traction, according to members of the panelon both sides of the aisle. And now,this ballgame is over:

A report summarizing a yearlong investigation by the legislative panel examining the George Washington Bridge lane closures found no evidence of Governor Christies involvement but concluded that two of his allies acted with perceived impunity when they gridlocked Fort Lees streets apparently for political reasons.

The committees 136-page report, drawing off sworn testimony, private interviews and thousands of subpoenaed documents, also highlights the unsuccessful efforts by a now-shuttered arm of Christies office to court the Fort Lee mayors endorsement, finding that the closures were motivated in part by political considerations.

The report states there is no conclusive evidence as to whether the governor was or was not aware of the lane closures or involved in directing them...The governors office released a statement late Thursday in response to the report from the attorney it hired to conduct its own investigation.

The committee has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago  namely, that there is not a shred of evidence Governor Christie knew anything about the GWB lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision, attorney Randy Mastro said. Thus, the committees work has simply corroborated our comprehensive investigation. And with this inquiry behind it, the governor and his office can now focus on doing what they do best  serving the public interest.

They looked at mountains of evidence and found nothing -- zip, nada, nothing -- that contradicted what Christie has said all along.The Bergen Recordstory on the findings, evidently written bydistraught reporters, stretches hardto cast the big take-awayas a potential negative for Christie because it ""puts a spotlight"" on the scandal. Even exonerations are plugged into the ""dark cloud"" spin machine. Sure, yetanother report has backed Christie up, but the fact that we're even talking about this veryserious scandal is bad news for him, or something. Sure. Thus, after more than a year of splashy headlines,ludicrous and discredited pile-on allegations, breathless cable newssegments, pitiful New York Timesscrounging, and late-night punchlines, 'Bridgegate' can officially be ruled a non-scandal as it pertains to the governor himself. Members of his inner circle behaved reprehensibly, and Christie deserves some criticism on that front, but he dealt with them very decisively and told the truth. Especiallyhard hit today is MSNBC, which covered this story with Watergate-level intensity until the facts started to disrupt their preferred narrative:



Conservatives in good standing arefree to disagree on whether Chris Christie might be an acceptable or viable potential Republicanpresidential nominee. He has certainstrengths andflaws that he'd bring to the table, justlike anybody else; that's a discussionfor another day. What should unite the Righttoday is a sense ofsatisfaction that a Democrat-media hit job on a Republican the Leftobviously fears (for better or worse) has gonedown in flames. On the merits, at least. Perhaps they've extracted their intended political price, independent of the facts and outcome-- but at an absolute minimum, Christie now has an airtight comeback if and when the other side tries to batter him withthe bridge story. From a political standpoint, he's also beginning to pull togetherthe strands of a comeback story, which even an ideologically hostile media can't resist. I'll leave you with Christie being very Christie-ish in Canada yesterday (his, ahem, second international trip of the year), declining to announce whether he'll run for president on foreign soil. He alsostrongly defended the Keystone Pipeline project:



UPDATE - The New York Times' headline on this reportisalmost virtuosic in its bias: Report Cites Gaps Between Records and Christies Comments on Bridge Lane Closings. Perfect.

Uh Oh: Rolling Stone Says There Are Discrepancies In Their UVA Story

Last month, Rolling Stone published a piece about an alleged gang rape that took place at the University of Virginia. It created a media firestorm, yet the New Republic (pre-purge), the Washington Post, and the New York Times all reported on how Rolling Stone reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely,didnt contactthe accused attackers for their statement, which would also verify their existence. 
Now, Rolling Stone has releasedthis statementclaiming that their trust was misplaced in their sourceJackieand there are discrepancies in her account of events:
Last month, Rolling Stone published a story titled ""A Rape on Campus"" by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, which described a brutal gang rape of a woman named Jackie at a University of Virginia fraternity house; the university's failure to respond to this alleged assault  and the school's troubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults. The story generated worldwide headlines and much soul-searching at UVA. University president Teresa Sullivan promised a full investigation and also to examine the way the school responds to sexual assault allegations.
Because of the sensitive nature of Jackie's story, we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed orchestrated the attack on her nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her. In the months Erdely spent reporting the story, Jackie neither said nor did anything that made Erdely, or Rolling Stone's editors and fact-checkers, question Jackie's credibility. Her friends and rape activists on campus strongly supported Jackie's account. She had spoken of the assault in campus forums. We reached out to both the local branch and the national leadership of the fraternity where Jackie said she was attacked. They responded that they couldn't confirm or deny her story but had concerns about the evidence. 
In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced. We were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account. We are taking this seriously and apologize to anyone who was affected by the story.
Will Dana
Managing Editor
So, what are the discrepancies? Well, for starters, the fraternity where Jackie was allegedly gang raped never had a party on the night of her attack (viaWaPo):
Officials close to the fraternity said that the statement will indicate that Phi Kappa Psi did not host a party on Sept. 28, 2012, the night that a university student named Jackie alleges she was invited to a date party, lured into an upstairs room and was then ambushed and gang-raped by seven men who were rushing the fraternity.
The officials also said that no members of the fraternity were employed at the universitys Aquatic Fitness Center during that time frame  a detail Jackie provided in her account to Rolling Stone and in interviews with The Washington Post  and that no member of the house matches the description detailed in the Rolling Stone account.
The attorney, Ben Warthen, who has represented Phi Kappa Psi, said the statement would come out Friday afternoon. He declined to comment further.

A group of Jackies close friends, who are sex assault awareness advocates at U-Va., said they believe something traumatic happened to Jackie but have come to doubt her account. They said details have changed over time, and they have not been able to verify key points of the story in recent days. A name of an alleged attacker that Jackie provided to them for the first time this week, for example, turned out to be similar to the name of a student who belongs to a different fraternity, and no one by that name has been a member of Phi Kappa Psi.
Reached by phone, that man, a U-Va. graduate, said Friday that he did work at the Aquatic Fitness Center and was familiar with Jackies name. He said, however, that he had never met Jackie in person and had never taken her on a date. He also confirmed that he was not a member of Phi Kappa Psi.
Heck, even the feminist Jezebel publicationissued an apology to those who were skeptical of the UVA story [warning: some strong language]:
This is really, really bad. It means, of course, that when I dismissed Richard Bradley and Robby Soave's doubts about the story and called them ""idiots"" for picking apart Jackie's account, I was dead fucking wrong, and for that I sincerely apologize. It means that my conviction that Sabrina Rubin Erdely had fact-checked her story in ways that were not visible to the public was also wrong. It's bad, bad, bad all around. (And, frankly, it could have been avoided, had Erdely been clearer in her disclosures about what she'd done to reach Jackie's alleged attackers and what her agreement with the girl had been. This announcement wouldn't be producing nearly the same shockwaves if those things had been clearly outlined.)
And, this isnt the first time Sabrina Erdely has been criticized for her reporting. The Federalists Mollie Hemingway founda 2012 storyfrom Erdely about how a school district in Minnesota handled anti-gay bullying; the superintendent called the piece a brutal and distorted attack: 
Rolling Stone magazine has the Anoka-Hennepin school district in a rage.

""This is a vicious insult to all of you who have worked so hard to make this district and this community a better place,"" the head of Minnesota's largest school district said in a voicemail fired off to his staff.
Written by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, ""One Town's War on Gay Teens"" chronicles the development of the district's controversial sexual orientation curriculum policy while weaving in personal stories of students who say they were bullied over their real or perceived sexual orientation. 

Further, Carlson reiterated that the district's investigation into the suicides found no direct link to bullying.
The article claims otherwise.
...

Laurie Thompson, president of the Parents Action League [a conservative parent group], said Erdely offered no proof that evangelicals or the district's policy had anything to do with the student suicides or bullying. 

Thompson said Erdely ""repeated and amplified the most biased and unverifiable rumors regarding bullying"" to reflect ""another agenda altogether - attacking evangelical Christians and portraying them as unreasonable bigots.""

Erdely said she asked the district to forward her contact information to teachers willing to talk about their attempts to affirm gay students and didn't hear from anyone. She also said she mentioned the district's progress, albeit late in the article and perhaps not in the ""glowing light the superintendent would have liked.""
Regardless, its pretty much confirmed that Rolling Stone botched this storyand made addressing the serious issue of sexual assault all the more difficult. Will lawsuits to be filed? Probably.
Congrats to Phi Kappa Psi for your acquisition of Rolling Stone. Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) December 5, 2014 
UPDATE:Sean Woods, who edited the story, will remain at the publication.Sean Woods, who edited the UVA rape story, will remain with Rolling Stone, a spokesperson tells me. (fixed typo) Andrew Beaujon (@abeaujon) December 5, 2014

Well I think we can guess with this video where Hillary thinks she needs to do some work.I mean the video speaks to me as a dude. See, Hilarys down to earth. Shes not the conniving, social climbing, callous, self aggrandizing crony capitalist who gets paid $300,000 per speech who takes piles of money from Goldman Sachs and the rest of Wall Street that I thought she was. The below video shows me this.Hillarys just waiting for bow hunting season. She drives an F-150 and can shotgun a Budweiser with the best of them. She shops at Walmart and knows the fun of a night at the tractor pull. She went all the time in Westchester County New York.My favorite part is where the guy in this video gets on a bike with his girlfriend driving. That is CLASSIC.Take a moment to watch the whole thing. You will want to turn it off midway because it is well, just God awful on nearly every level. But dont. Let the cynical political propagandizing wash over you. Just imagine the producers in Washington DC and in New York city auditioning authentic looking country music guys.This is musical poo.For more from Nick Sorrentino, please visitAgainstCronyCapitalism.org

The bad news keeps getting worse: New Jerseys public retirement system faces a $170 billion deficit for pensions and health benefits for government retirees, according to the latest official figures from the state Treasury.The state pension shortfall doubled under new accounting standards, intended to provide a more realistic fiscal picture. As a result, the reported unfunded pension liability of $51 billion in 2013 expanded to a $103 billion shortfall when the new guidelines from the Governmental Accounting Standards Board took effect this June.This is just a financial reporting change and does not materially impact New Jerseys fiscal position, said Treasury spokesman Christopher Santarelli.

Biogens Alzheimer Surprise

I have written about Biogen (BIIB) previously in numerous articles as it is one of my favorite biotech names.  But the positive thesis on the stock was tied to its success with its Multiple Sclerosis drug franchise.  It also recently had a drug approved for Hemophilia back in June, giving it yet another drug with blockbuster potential. But an Alzheimers drug not really on anyones radar, a drug still in Phase 1 trials, just reported some very promising data at Deutsche Banks BIOFEST.  The data was so promising in fact that the company will start performing Phase 3 trials, skipping over Phase 2 entirely.   Drug makers have been trying for years to develop an effective treatment for Alzheimers disease which affects 5 million people in the U.S and is the 6th leading cause of death.  It is a tragic disease which takes a huge toll on patients and family members, but the disease also has a huge financial impact on us as a country as it is the most expensive condition in the nation.  According to data compiled by the Alzheimers Association, the direct costs to American society of caring for those with Alzheimers is $214 billion, $150 billion of which is paid for by Medicare and Medicaid.   The company announced that results from a 194-patient Phase 1 trial for BIIB-037, which it is jointly developing with Japans Eisai, were positive enough to warrant a push straight to Phase 3.  The result that has gotten everyone so excited is that the trial saw statistically significant improvement in cognitive ability after 54 weeks of treatment.  But another groundbreaking aspect of the trial was it may confirm an aspect of the disease that was only suspected before and never proven.   Beta amyloid is a toxic form of protein that builds up on the brain of Alzheimers patients, forming visible plaque.  Up until now, it was unsubstantiated that reducing the plaque would reduce symptoms.  Other drugmakers had based drugs on that theory and failed miserably.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE) and Elan, and Eli Lilly (LLY) all had promising Alzheimers drugs which did not succeed.   Other drugs were able to reduce plaque, but these results were the first to demonstrate an associated benefit in brain function.  Obviously Biogens results are still very early-stage and there are still dosing and safety issues, but investors and analysts were still very excited with the data.  As mentioned, these results were not really on anyones radar.  The news lifted the stock out of the doldrums.  Biogen shares traded up almost $21 per share or 7% on the news.  So based on this news, lets take another look at Biogen stock.  Biogen is a large cap stock with a market cap of $72.8 billion.  While technically it is a biotech name, it has multiple drugs that have received FDA approval qualifying it as a drug stock with a Conservative risk profile.  I am long Biogen stock in my Conservative Growth accounts.    Data from Best Stocks Now app  Data from Best Stocks Now app Biogens receives a Value Grade of A.  Its forward PE multiple is 19, which is in line with the overall market.  But its growth rate is more than 21% giving it an attractive PEG ratio of less than 1.    Data from Best Stocks Now app Biogen stock has been a stellar performer for many years on the growth prospects of its MS drug franchise.  It has consistently delivered returns in excess of the market, although it trailed the S&P 500 YTD.  Data from Best Stocks Now app Currently Biogen stock ranks #707 out of the 3900+ stocks in the Best Stocks Now universe.  The stock receives a Stock Grade of B+ which qualifies as a weak buy signal.  However, nobody had Biogens Alzheimers drug in its models. Should this drug continue to achieve positive results, this would be a game changer for the company.  The pivotal data is not expected to come out until 2018-2019 which is pretty far out.  But it may be worth hanging out to see if this surprise continues to be a good one.

The Christian Science Monitor,C,"With Eric Garner case, Mayor de Blasio finds more resolute voice - CSMonitor.com","class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				
New York  As the nation continues to grapple with the emotionally charged aftermath of the grand jury decisions in the police killings of two black men, Eric Garner and Michael Brown, perhaps no political leader has more at stake than New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.The longstanding and nationwide issues surrounding policing and minority communities, after all, are Mr. de Blasios signature issue. As he railed against stop and frisk and other aggressive policing as a candidate last year, his message resonated, catapulting him from a little-known local leader into one of the nations progressive chief executives  on a global stage in Americas largest metropolis.But now that the issue has gripped the nations consciousness, de Blasio could be facing one of the most important tests of leadership, one that could not only determine the success of his tenure as mayor, but also influence the direction of the nation as he attempts to reshape both the city and the New York Police Department, the largest and arguably most influential force in the United States.

			Heroes and scoundrels: What do you know about New York mayors? Take our quiz.
		
He is on something of a precipice of what could either be his moment, or what could easily go horribly wrong, says Jeanne Zaino, professor of political campaign management at New York Universitys School of Professional Studies. Either way, I think this is really an important moment for him.

On Thursday, President Obama commended the mayor for his emotional speech following the grand jurys decision in the Garner case. The grand jury declined to indict a police officer for a headlock takedown that contributed to the mans death on a Staten Island sidewalk.Indeed, many observers have noted a change in the New York mayor since the grand jury decision on Wednesday, suggesting, as the well-worn expressions goes, that he has finally found his voice this year, after a number of missteps.The relationship between the police and the community has to change, an impassioned de Blasio said at the New York Police Academy Thursday. The way we go about policing has to change. It has to change in this city; it has to change in this country. I am fundamentally convinced it will change.The mayor  who has drawn some criticism from his supporters for not specifically speaking out against the grand jury decision, as even many conservatives have  outlined the NYPDs new annual training program. That program, announced after Mr. Garners death, will emphasize that officers treat all citizens with respect and with regard for their safety, even during arrests.Like Mr. Obama, many others have noted de Blasios deeply personal and emotional 20-minute speech on Wednesday, after the grand jury decision.When I turned on the television and saw de Blasio speaking, the first thing that I noticed was that he didnt have a prepared text, which stunned me, says Kenneth Sherrill, professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College in Manhattan. And I thought to myself, how can you negotiate this mine field? Theres so many mistakes you can make, so many wrong words you can inadvertently choose.De Blasio spoke of the unspeakable pain of Garners father and told New Yorkers that the issue is profoundly personal for his own family because of the dangers he perceives for his biracial son, Dante.The mayor also suggested that the current problems are deep-seated  rooted in not just decades, but centuries of racism in the country.But these are the issues that have put the de Blasio administration on a political precipice all year. New York City police officers bristle at any suggestion of racism, and they continue to mistrust the mayor  and they vehemently resent how close he is to the Rev. Al Sharpton.After being elected, de Blasio in fact has muted his criticisms of the NYPD, upon which his administration must rely. So far, crime has continued to fall to record lows this year, and any uptick could imperil the mayors entire progressive agenda.The difficult relationship between the mayor and the NYPD can be seen in comments from Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association and a 30-year veteran of the NYPD.The mayor has opportunities here to really build a brand, to really build a reputation for himself, he says. But it cannot be a one-sided tale of two cities, a city that he thinks [represents] his beef with inequality.He has to speak for all people, and his statement [Wednesday], in response to what took place, and how he had to talk to his son, I really think is divisive, Sergeant Mullins continues.Although the reactions to the grand jury decision in New York have been much more united than those after the decision in Missouri, challenges for de Blasios leadership loom, observers note. Its awfully hard for anyone in public office, a mayor or any chief executive, to sympathize with protesters, says Professor Zaino. And yet if anything goes awry, if theres any violence, youre going to get the blame for that."

While online anonymizing tools may protect against many accidental and even malicious eavesdroppers, theres no guarantee of completely avoiding the new array of surveillance capabilities, says Dan Kaminsky, chief scientist at New York-based security vendor White Ops.Absolute anonymity is not a particularly achievable thing, says Mr. Kaminsky.One dramatic example isOperation Onymousinvolving the recent takedown of more than 400 allegedly illegal websites operating on the Tor network by an international coalition of law enforcement agencies from the US and the European Union. Tor is widely acknowledged as the strongest anonymizing service on the Internet.That operation was the second time in recent months that law enforcement has been able to uncloak sites operating on Tor. The first time was last fall, when they similarly managed to take down online black market Silk Road.Those takedowns show that given enough time and resources, even people using a service such as Tor can be found out.The increasing difficulty to hide on the Web isn't just bad news for people seeking anonymity for illicit activities. Digital rights advocates see these developments as having a chilling effect on potential whistleblowers or stifling opposition movements in places like China and Iran or on American activists who may have good reasons to keep their pursuits secret.This is an excerpt of a story from Passcode, the Monitor's forthcoming section on security and privacy.Read the full article here.If you are interested in stories like this, sign up forPasscode, the Monitor's forthcoming site covering security and privacy in the digital age.

The Christian Science Monitor,C,Jihadi hostage-taking: Could it get out of control in Lebanon? - CSMonitor.com,"class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				
Beirut, Lebanon  While the world has been transfixed  and horrified  by the gruesome and chilling hostage dramas played out in the Middle East these past months, Lebanon has been gripped by its own increasingly convoluted kidnapping crisis.The lives of some 26 Lebanese soldiers and policemen hang in the balance as the government in Beirut wages a protracted and tense negotiating battle with two of the most radical and aggressive Islamist groups operating today in the Middle East: the extremist Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, Syrias Al Qaeda affiliate.Now Lebanons detention of two women and a videotaped threat to capture the wives and children of Lebanese soldiers is raising the specter of an already white-knuckled process spinning out of control.

The Islamic State has embedded its brutal reputation in the consciousness of the international community with the cold-blooded executions of five Westerners, either journalists or aid workers, since August. It also has executed hundreds, possibly thousands, of Syrians and Iraqis since seizing large areas of northern Iraq and eastern Syria earlier this year.

On Thursday, the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a video in which it threatened to kill Luke Somers, an American journalist who was kidnapped in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, in September 2013.Lebanon is no stranger to hostage dramas  much of the international headlines in the 1980s featured the plight of Westerners kidnapped in civil-wartorn Beirut. The current crisis began in early August when some 700 mainly Syrian militants stormed the town of Arsal close to Lebanons northeastern border with Syria.After several days of fighting with the Lebanese Army, the militants retreated to their stronghold in the mountains spanning the border, taking with them large quantities of looted weaponry and more than 30 captured soldiers and policemen. A handful of Sunni captives were released, but the rest, numbering around 26, were divided up between the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra. Their captors are demanding the release of Islamist militants in Lebanese jails.The governments response to the crisis has been muddled. There appear to be at least three mediators; two are Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, the head of a Lebanese security agency, and Ahmad al-Khatib, a Syrian who was appointed mediator by Qatar, which has some influence with militant groups in Syria. The third is Sheikh Mustapha Hujairy, a Sunni cleric from Arsal who has been helping mediate even though he was indicted in absentia by a Lebanese court in October for being a member of Jabhat al-Nusra.Families holding permanent sit-inBoth sides have grown increasingly frustrated as the weeks pass with no resolution. Three of the hostages have been executed. The families of the hostages have repeatedly blocked roads across Lebanon and are holding a permanent sit-in near the parliament building in central Beirut to pressure the government into making a deal.Last weekend, Jabhat al-Nusra warned it would execute one of the hostages by 10 p.m. Monday over what it said was the governments delay in agreeing to a prisoner swap. The execution was subsequently postponed because, according to Lebanese media reports, General Ibrahim threatened to kill two imprisoned Islamist detainees if the hostage was harmed.Following a meeting of the Lebanese cabinet Thursday, Information Minister Ramzi Joreige said that the hostage crisis was very sensitive and complicated and admonished the local media, saying their coverage was not helping.In the latest twist to the drama, it was revealed this week that the Lebanese authorities had detained a woman believed to be a former wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, along with his four-year-old daughter. The Lebanese government said DNA tests have proved her identity and she is currently being held at the Lebanese Ministry of Defense.Also languishing in a Defense Ministry cell is the wife of Abu Ali al-Shishani, an Islamic State commander. She was arrested in north Lebanon.Threat on YouTubeThe Lebanese government apparently hopes that the detention of the two women will grant it leverage in the negotiations.But a furious Abu Ali al-Shishani posted a video statement on YouTube Thursday threatening to kidnap the wives and children of Lebanese soldiers if his wife was not released.We will not rest until all our women are out of prison. Damn you and your Army, said Shishani sitting before an Islamic State flag and flanked by two masked militants.Women and children of the pigs and the slaves of Khomeini and all who follow them: all your wives, children, and men are legitimate targets now, he said, referring to members of the Iran-backed militant Shiite Hezbollah, a bitter enemy of radical Sunni groups."

				Tens of thousands of people along the Philippines eastern coast have evacuated their homes ahead of Typhoon Hagupit, an approaching storm that ranks among the most powerful this year.With memories of Typhoon Haiyan fresh in their minds, it appears few coastal communities are taking any chances withHagupit. Local and international media report that thousands of people in areas hardest hit by last years storm  many still living in temporary shelters  are already in evacuation centers.We didnt need to convince them, Borongan City Mayor Maria Fe Abunda told The Wall Street Journal. People are aware of what is going on, especially after what happened last year with Haiyan. Theyre voluntarily coming to the evacuation centers.

Hagupit is about 186 miles east of Borongan, a city of 65,000 on the Pacific Ocean,and is moving west at 6 mph, according to the latest report from the Philippine weather agency. The agency predicts the typhoon will make landfall on Saturday night or early Sunday morning over Northern and Eastern Samar, two of the poorest provinces in the country. Heavy rains and a storm surge of up to 13 feet high are also expected.

Hagupit  named Ruby in the Philippines  most recently clocked sustained winds of 121 mph and gusts of 143 mph. Weather authorities say Hagupit is unlikely to make landfall with winds as powerful as Haiyan. But they warn it could arrive more slowly, giving it the potential to stay over land longer and do more damage.Borongan sits directly in the path of Hagupit. The Philippine Star reports local authorities have told residents in low-lying areas to voluntarily evacuate and that those who refuse would be forcibly removed. More than 10,000 residents are already in 30 evacuation centers.Farther south in Tacloban, the city worst hit by Haiyan, Vice Mayor Jerry Yaokasin told reporters that government officials were strictly enforcing evacuation orders.We have no more excuse, Mr. Yaokasin said. We have gone through Yolanda [the Filipino name for Haiyan], and to lose that many lives, it's beyond our conscience already.Haiyan became the strongest storm ever to make landfall when it tore across the midsection of the Philippines last November, killing more than 6,300 and displacing 4.1 million more. It caused an estimated $12 billion in damage.Recovery and rebuilding efforts are well underway across regions ravaged by Haiyan. But with Hagupit looming, aid workers and government officials worry how much progress will be lost  and how well theyll be able to respond in the aftermath of the new storm. Many relief groups have shifted their focus to long-term development in recent months, leaving them ill prepared to handle emergency relief.A lot of people around here are absolutely petrified of what is going to happen, says Orla Fagan, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Manila. There are a lot of vulnerable people still out there.OCHA reported in October that25,000 people still lived in transitional housingsuch as tents and evacuation centers. It estimated that an additional 475,000 people were living in unsafe and inadequate makeshift shelters, leaving them highly exposed to the approaching storm."
The Christian Science Monitor,C,Five burger trends to watch in 2015 - CSMonitor.com,"class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				Last year BurgerBusiness.com forecast aYear of Freshwith vegetables and herbs emerging as popular toppings. We didnt wait longer than February for that to be borne out: Burger Boss in Evergreen Park, Ill., made the French Cauliflower Melt its burger of the month. So Ill say I was good on that forecast.2015 could be the Year of the Cheeseburger because of, not in spite of, higher beef prices.But I missed on hot dogs. Hot dogs were everywhere on menus this year, from Sonics Cheesy Bread Dogs and Chili Cheese Pretzel Dogs to Carls Jr.s Jumbo Chili Dogs. Indies like Crow Burger Kitchen in Newport Beach, Calif., and Grill Em All in Alhambra, Calif., are topping burgers with grilled hot dogs.

What I also didnt see coming was the crazily rapid rise of menu crowd sourcing. It seems every independent burger bar now has asks customers to dream up the burger of the month or some other special. McDonalds has successfully run its My Burger promotion across Europe. Have burger joints run out of ideas? No, I think the create our next LTO trend is about customer engagement, and thats always good.

So how about 2015? I think these five trends are worth watching:The Year of the Cheeseburger:Not the cheeseburger with bacon, arugula, aoli, sambal and onion rings. Just a good ol Cheeseburger, where the quality of good beef reclaims the spotlight. Does that mean over-the-top burgers are pass? Certainly not! Theyre fun and delicious. But sometimes simple is best. Sometimes whats wanted is a good burger. Burger joints and their customers will rediscover simple in 2015. That first entry on most burger joint menus, sometimes called the Original or the Classic or just Cheeseburger, gets in the game again in 2015.Beef is going to be even more expensive in 2015. Burger bars will want customers to taste the quality of the pricey meat.In a Pickle:House-pickled toppings are going to be big(ger). House-made pickles are popping up everywhere and thats just the start. Look for pickled vegetables of all sorts to proliferate.Whats for Breakfast?:Burger King made news when it said it would start selling Whoppers in the morning. The next step, and one that even McDonalds ought to be able to take part in, is egg-topped breakfast burgers. Burger King has a Breakfast Whopper in New Zealand now. Why not here?Espresso Yourself:We have Burgers & Beers and Burgers & Bourbons concepts, but how about Burger & Espresso bars? A few such places pairing these two have opened on the West coast and in Australia (check outBatch Burgers & Espresso). Short of that, watch for coffee to be a popular rub or flavoring for burgers around the world.Swap Meat:Because beef will be more expensive and because there also are more diners willing to go meatless, if only occasionally, watch for burger bars to create better non-meat burgers. Watch for them topromotethose veggie burgers, too, and not just list them at the bottom of the menu. Crabtrees Kittle House Restaurant and Inn in Chappaqua, N.Y., included this year on Wine Enthusiasts 100 Best Wine Restaurants list, menus a Pat LaFrieda custom-blend cheeseburger alongside a quinoa, chickpea, corn and mushroom burger. Watch for more parity like that."
The Christian Science Monitor,C,"US 'terrorism?' What's not being said about Kansas City, Austin attacks. - CSMonitor.com","class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				Yesterday, a man in an SUV who'd been making online and in-person threats against the Muslim community ran down and killed a 15-year-old boy getting into the family car outside a mosque in Kansas City, Mo. At the end of last month a man with ties to extremist Christian groups and opposed to immigration fired more than 100 rounds at various targets in Austin, Texas, including the police headquarters, the federal courthouse, and the Mexican consulate, before he was killed.In neither case has the word ""terrorism"" featured prominently in the coverage of the attack. And, if the US press and politicians stay true to what's become the accepted framing for homegrown ""terrorism,"" it's unlikely to appear much going forward.The adoption of slogans like the ""war on terrorism"" since Al Qaeda's attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 was supposed to be about the tactic, not about the underlying beliefs of the attacker. But in practice, terrorism carried out by Muslims is portrayed as far scarier, a far greater danger, than similar violent acts carried out by adherents of other faiths.

The killing in Kansas City happened outside a mosque mostly frequented by Somali immigrants, and the attacker was also a Somali, a convert from Islam to Christianity, according to local community members. It became pretty clear that this was not an accidental crash, there is a considerable amount of evidence that leads us to believe it was intentional, Sgt. Bill Mahoney from the Kansas City Police told the local Fox affiliate.

Local station KCTV spoke to members of the Somali community who had a photograph of what they said was the attacker's SUV from two months ago, when it carried the slogan: ""Quran is a virus disease woreste [sic] than Ebola.""Moussa Elbayoumy, the Kansas Chairman of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, says members of the targeted mosque had reported recent threats against the community posted on Facebook, and an incident in which the attacker drew a gun on Somali Muslims, to the police.""We understand this person is a known person to the community and had made several threats to the community in the past few months,"" says Elbayoumy. ""The local police were informed of these threats.... The police came and investigated, and as a matter of fact that young man who died is one of the people interviewed by the police. We are not sure what the police did, if anything. Did they take these threats seriously and give some protection to the community in the light of these threats? Thats what we want to know.""Mr. Elbayoumy says his group has warm relations with Christian and Jewish communities in the area and that incidents like this are extremely rare. Still, ""We feel that Islamophobic hate speech that at times becomes spread in different elements of our society in general against Islam has a direct impact on people like (the alleged attacker). We could even call this a terrorist act.""What Elbayoumy is talking about is what is sometimes called ""incitement,"" an issue that gets far greater attention when the attacker is motivated by his beliefs about Islam than it is about other groups.So far, the killing has received less national attention than the Oct. 23 Queens hatchet attack on police officers in New York City that ended in the death of the attacker, Zale Thomspon, a ""self-radicalized convert to Islam"" in the words of the NYPD. The word ""terror"" and its variants appeared five time in the Monitor's own story about the attack the next day. The word does not make an appearance in the Monitor's story on the Austin rampage of Steve McQuilliams from the same day as the Nov. 28 attack.This is not to single out my own publication or the diligent professionals who work for it. A similar approach can be found in most US media when such incidents hit the news. This is a result of national culture.Take the lede to the Wikipedia article on the Queens attack, which shows how mainstream the belief in the causal relationship is between Islam and terrorism has become. ""The incident was being investigated and it was found out that Thompson was a recent Muslim convert, making his attack an act of terrorism."" The attack in Austin by Mr. McQuilliams has not yet been graced with a Wikipedia article at all.Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said of McQuilliams on Dec. 1 that ""hate was in his heart.... He is a homegrown American terrorist. NBC Austin affiliate KXAN writes:
Acevedo said the book Vigilantes of Christendom was also found in the shooters van along with a note and Bible verses indicating he planned on fighting anti-God people. Statements made in interviews also tied him to ultra-conservative groups with anti-Semitic, anti-homosexual, and anti-bi-racial families, according to Acevedo.
Terrorists come in all sorts of colors, ethnicities, and religions, said Acevedo. By no means can you call him anything other than an extremist.
What do the statistics tell us? The good news, as shown by a 2012 report from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism that examined domestic attacks between 1970 and 2011, is that the number of incidents has plunged, from over 450 in 1970 to a recent annual average of less than 25. The declining trend has continued since 2001.Though far and away the most terrorist fatalities have been as a result of Muslims motivated by their beliefs, on account of the 9/11 attack, those motivated by far-right and antigovernment views  as was the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people in 1995  have been far more active in recent years. The Southern Poverty Law Center says there have been at least 29 similarly motivated attacks in the US since 2010. In a review of Muslim-American terrorism in the US in 2013, Duke University sociologist Charles Kurzman found that the total number of Muslim-Americans involved in domestic terrorism since 2011 was 225, or fewer than 20 a year.In 2013, which included the jihad-inspired terrorist attack on the Boston Marathon that claimed four victims, there were 30 mass killings, claiming a total of 137 lives."

Tokyo  Isshu Fujii, a senior at Tokyos Aoyama Gakuin University, has a sense hes bucking a trend he sees among Japanese youths.At a time when more of his peers are choosing the comforts of life in their island nation over studying abroad, Mr. Fujii has his sights set on graduate study in either the United States or the United Kingdom.Wherever he ends up, the young advocate of a more robust global role for his homeland wants to pursue security studies  a discipline he says hardly exists in a country with an enduring  though evolving  postwar pacifist tradition.

I do think Japanese young people are pretty comfortable and are content to choose an easier path, Fujii says. Theres this idea that the Internet and social media bring the world to you, he adds, and if they do think about going abroad, its more for a limited experience than the hard road of studying and learning a new language.

But the picture Fujii paints of a younger generation inwardly focused even as tensions rise in Asia, and many of their South Korean and Chinese counterparts study abroad, is prompting alarm in Tokyo  and spurring some initial remedial measures from the Abe government, which also envisions a more robust global role for Japan in the 21st century.Mr. Abe, whose concerns about Japan's lost luster extend to the stagnant economy, has called elections forDec. 14in hopes of delivering a boost to stalled reform efforts. Its not so much a worry for us if more Chinese and South Korean students are going abroad, its actually positive if instead of remaining in China, for example, the Chinese come to Japan or go elsewhere and learn a different view of human rights and universal rights, says Takako Ito, assistant press secretary at Japans Ministry of Foreign Affairs.But what is a challenge, she adds, is if our students are becoming more introverted.A decade ago, nearly 83,000 students were studying abroad, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But by 2011, the number was down to 57,500. Japanese studying in the US have declined even more sharply, from nearly 46,000 in 2002 to under 20,000 in 2011.The concern over the phenomenon is both economic and political.Aless globally conscious and entrepreneurial Japan could lose to more dynamic countries around it. At the same time, a key pillar for Abe  revising the pacifist Constitution to allow a stronger regional security posture  could also be thwarted by a population that sees little benefit from engaging more with an increasingly fractious region. Many young people here, mirroring the general population, may simply opt for a status quo that they see as having given Japan nearly seven decades of peace, some experts say.To begin to reverse the trend, the governmentdoubled scholarships for undergraduate study abroad from 10,000 to 20,000, while increasing scholarships for graduate students to study abroad from 200 to 250 this year.More ambitious still is a new joint venture between the government and private sector that aims to send 10,000 students for study in the US by 2020. Called the ""Tobitate! Young Ambassador Program,"" the initiative has already received $80 million in pledges from Japanese companies, and this fall sent the first 84 ""ambassadors"" to American universities.The government is also phasing in an earlier start for English instruction, beginning in primary school.But just how far such initiatives will go in stoking a broader interest in what many Japanese see as a threatening outside world remains a question for some experts. Fumio Ota, former director of Defense Intelligence and a retired professor at the National Defense Academy, sees an ambivalence about the world among young people, spurred by uncertainty. They see the international situation is very severe, from the difficult relations with China to threats from North Korea, and the tendency for some is to turn away from the world and focus on life in Japan, he says.And young people who want Japan to assume the role of a more active regional power are still in the minority, Dr. Ota says. You do hear more often among young people the idea that if Japan remains limited in its security capabilities by a postwar Constitution, that could actually encourage instability in the region by suggesting to others that Japan cannot properly defend itself, he says.A bigger factor behind widespread indifference towards the world is prosperity, Ota says. When I was a youngster our society was poor, and young people were more driven to go to a more advanced foreign country, he says. For many that interest isnt there anymore.High costs are a factorStill, some students say there are reasons other than indifference to explain the falling numbers.Many students do want to understand global issues and develop a global view, but it costs a lot of money to study abroad so they study those issues in Japan if they can, or take advantage of less expensive options, says Marino Mori, a political science major at Gakushuin University.Tuition at an American university can be four times or more that of a Japanese university  which helps explain why many students studying abroad opt for programs in Australia and New Zealand. Others say Ja stagnant economy heightens worries about landing a good job out of university and discourages efforts to fit a year aboard into a tight study schedule. One reform has targeted the traditional post-college recruitment calendar to accommodate those studying abroad.Ms. Mori, who is Japan vice-chairwoman of the Japan-America Student Conference, a prestigious student exchange and discussion program, says more students are seeking alternatives like the one she helps organize that offer a taste of international affairs without costing so much or taking them away from their studies.Some young people are also simply trying new ways to energize their peers.Ryo Masuzawa, a graduate student at Tokyo Institute of Technology, recently set up a food delivery service aimed at Millennials that delivers a monthly newsletter on a topic of interest along with the donburi and soba noodles. A recent issue focused on the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement among Pacific Basin countries and the impact it could have on Japans agriculture and food production.Japanese young people dont have a good view of politics, their participation in elections is very low. But at the same time surveys indicate they want to be involved in improving the world but they dont know how to, Mr. Masuzawa says. The idea behind Eating and Politics,  his food-with-a-side-of-ideas project, is to get young people thinking about how their involvement in something can make a difference.But will they think like Abe?A more active youth population is almost certainly something the Abe government would like to encourage. But its also true that many of Japans more globally minded young people have a perspective that doesnt align with Abes vision.Indeed, some self-described internationalists see merit in preserving Japans status quo, including constitutionally imposed limits on military activity and they dont believe that should hinder Japan from being an outward-looking nation.Japan was able to become a global economic power without abandoning our pacifist approach, and I think we should continue along that line, says Yugo Kimura, who is majoring in global politics and economics at Waseda University.Social media in Japan are full of belligerent discussions of the neighbors, in particular China, that are fueled by a small but loud slice of extremist youth, Mr. Kimura says.

On the contrary, I favor a friendly approach because I think there are benefits for everybody in regional cooperation.Kimura holds so strongly to the idea of Japan avoiding conflict that he would favor his country ceding to China on territorial conflicts over open confrontation.I think Japan should focus on its economic relations in East Asia and find other ways to take up these territorial disputes, he says.

NAIROBI, KENYA  A deadly fire is all that betrayed a suspected Chinese hacker group in Kenya believed to be trying to infiltrate banks, mobile money transfer networks, and ATMs.So far, police have arrested and charged 77 Chinese nationals in connection with activities in an upscale Nairobi suburb. During the raids, police found soundproof rooms fashioned like military dorms that were full of computer equipment and outfitted with high-speed Internet connections, which is uncommon in Kenya.The discovery of what police call a cybercrime command center comes as Kenya is experiencing a wave of computer crime, with criminal hackers carrying out phishing campaigns to extort money from citizens and launching attacks on banks. The arrests are a fortunate break for a police force struggling to contain the problem.

Kenya loses $22.8 million annually to computer crime, according to a recent report on cybersecurityfromSerianu Limited, a Kenyan IT and business consulting firm. In 2013 alone, the company found, bank customers lost $17 million through fraudulent schemes involving their employees. It said the number of cyberattacks there has climbed to 5.4 million in 2013 from 2.6 million in 2012.

In Kenya, the perpetrators of computer fraud and criminal hacks are rarely found or arrested, say experts. In this recent case, fire blamed on a malfunctioning computer server revealed the suspects. With the fire spreading quickly, killing one person, the Chinese nationals refused help from their Kenyan neighbors, creating suspicion that prompted them to call the police.An eyewitness who visited the houses following the fire said computer equipment was everywhere inside. There were seven houses being used by the Chinese. I think some escaped the raid, says the witnesses, who did not want to be named.So far, charges facing the suspects include being in Kenya illegally and running radio equipment without the necessary permit. Prosecutors say they will add more charges for the remanded suspects, as they moved to the High Court, seeking bail.Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Liu Xiafana was called by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain if his government was aware of the suspects, who held Chinese passports. There's no indication that they were connected to the Chinese government.If you are interested in stories about cybersecurity, sign up forPasscode, the Monitor's forthcoming site covering security and privacy in the digital age.

				""Journey for Justice"" protesters descended on the capital of Missouri Friday after marching 130 miles from the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.The week-long march was organized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in response to the grand jury decision not to indict a white police officer for the shooting death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, in Ferguson.Passing through the rural town of Rosebud on Wednesday, protesters encountered counterprotesters, some of whom yelled racial slurs at the other protesters. One man wore what appeared to be a Ku Klux Klan hood while standing next to a car with a Confederate flag mounted on it.

In a video on The Huffington Post, NAACP president and CEO Cornell William Brooks expressed his gratitude for the support he has seen throughout the days of the march but added that he was disappointed by those who resorted to shouting obscenities at peaceful protesters.""What we've seen is an extraordinary array of citizens of Missouri who've brought us coffee, hot chocolate, sandwiches, refreshments all along the way without being asked, people who have come and shed tears, prayed for us,"" he said. ""And we've seen a few people who've used the N-word, who've asserted their First Amendment rights with obscenities.""Though he said he supports the right of individuals to express how they feel, he urged people not to give into their fears.""We support their right to protest. But we're simply posing this question: Why be afraid? You need not be afraid of an organization that's committed to nonviolence, that's committed to bettering this country,"" Mr. Brooks said. ""Over the last 105 years, that's what we've done. And so the people in these communities, the few people who've called us the N-word or shouted obscenities at us, all we say to them is don't be afraid. Step up, step forward, and better your country. And one of the best ways to do that ... is to stand with law enforcement that believes that law enforcement can yet be better.""Clyde Zelch, former mayor of the city of Rosebud, said that while he recognizes the possible need to improve law enforcement, he supports the police, echoing the sentiment of protesters who held signs voicing support for former officer Darren Wilson, who shot Mr. Brown.""I support the police,"" he said in The Huffington Post video. ""We may have a system that needs to be improved on. But it's a system our Founding Fathers gave us, and what the NAACP acts like is that we're supposed to throw out everything that's worked for 200 years, and the only version that they want is one in which they win every time. It should not be us against them. This is just simply criminals committing crimes and having to pay a price for that.""Friday's protest in Jefferson City comes at a time of heated racial tensions between police and the black communities they patrol. A week after the grand jury announced no indictment in the Ferguson shooting, a grand jury in New York announced no indictment in the death of Eric Garner, a black man, at the hands of a white police officer in July.On Thursday, the US Justice Department announced that an investigation into the Cleveland Police Department had found ""a pattern or practice of unreasonable and unnecessary use of force."" The investigation's findings included discussion of officers escalating encounters with citizens as opposed to defusing the situation and officers ""using guns in a careless and dangerous manner.""And on Thursday night, a black man was shot dead by a white Phoenix police officer. The officer reportedly mistook a pill bottle for a gun onRumain Brisbon. That shooting sparked about 150 protesters to march in the Arizona capital.Throughout the past two weeks, demonstrators have gathered in cities around the country to express grief for lives lost at the hands of police officers and to protest what they see as a pattern of injustice in handling such cases.At a protest Thursday night in downtown Boston, Carolyn Little held a candle as she stoodquietly off to the side of a large crowd.""This is a human problem,and my heart is broken and sick that this even has to take place,"" she said, referring to the scene around her.Monitor staff writer David Unger and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Tel Aviv  Over the summer, in the middle of a two-month-long Israeli-Palestinian war, representatives of some of the biggest names in tech crammed into the stairwell of a Tel Aviv skyscraper to wait out Hamas rocket fire.Wearing Sequoia Capital name tags and TechCrunch T-shirts, they squeezed against one another, passing the time by talking about the Paris startup scene and the success rate of Iron Dome, Israels missile defense system.They came to Tel Aviv for the demo day of a uniquely Israeli brand of startup incubator: one conducted by graduates of Israel Defense Forces Unit 8200  the Israeli NSA. It was a fitting reminder of the close ties between Israels Silicon Wadi (the nickname for Israels startup ecosystem) and the countrys military establishment.The 8200 is the largest unit in the Israeli army. Its responsible for signals intelligence, eavesdropping and wiretapping, as well as advanced technical jobs and translating work. It is also widely acknowledged as producing a disproportionately high percentage of Israel's tech executives and startup founders, including the brains behind Check Point Software Technologies, NICE Systems, and Mirabilis (creator of the proto-instant messaging system ICQ)  three of the biggest Israeli tech companies.

In general, the military intelligence and technological units of the Israeli army (including 8200) provide the training ground for much of the country's tech successes. The founders of Waze, a popular GPS navigation app acquired by Google last year for more than a billion dollars , served in military intelligence. MobileSpaces, which was bought last month by the US firm Pulse Secure for $100 million, was founded by graduates of Unit 8200.

Adam Singolda spent seven years doing advanced encryption for the IDF before he founded Taboola in 2007, a recommendation engine that has an estimated value of $1.5 billion. Founders of the Web development platform Wix.com also served in 8200. That company went public last year in the biggest Wall Street debut ever for an Israeli company.Because an intelligence background is not always publicly available information, its impossible to compile statistics, but experts agree the effect of the intelligence and technological units on the countrys hi-tech sector is massive.If you are interested in stories like this, sign up forPasscode, the Monitor's forthcoming site covering security and privacy in the digital age.

It should be noted that it's not uncommon for former members of the intelligence community in other countries to found startups as well (ex-NSA employees have had a few successes recently) but the relationship between military intelligence and private industry is especially strong in the Jewish State, where the majority of the population is required to serve in the armed forces and there are more startups per capita than in any other country in the world.As Dan Senor and Paul Singer noted in Start-Up Nation, their book on Israels hi-tech success story, while its difficult to get into the top Israeli universities, the nations equivalent of Harvard, Princeton and Yale are the IDFs elite units.Yinon Glasner, who has served for the last three years as the incubators program manager and is himself an 8200 alumnus, says that its a combination of responsibility at a young age and a creative, pressured environment that makes 8200 soldiers (and those from similar technology units in other branches of the military) such great startup founders.At the age of 19 or 20, he says, you are facing very complex challenges and you have to overcome them and find solutions. You have to think out of the box and be creative. And theyre technical solutions so basically youre left with a start-up.Experience in 8200 can be a serious advantage when applying for jobs in the tech sector or acquiring investment for startups in Israel. Moshe Bercovich, who served in the unit and later founded the startup Photoccino, says that depending on what work you did in the unit it can be very useful later in life. If you were pretty technical, did research and development, then it is very helpful  as this experience serves as a quality stamp for employers, he says.One group trying to capitalize on the link between military training and startup success is Jerusalem Venture Partners, an Israeli venture capital group with a $600 million investment fund that opened their new Cyber Labs in the southern city of Beer Sheva this year. Cybersecurity is a booming industry for Israel. Israeli cybersecurity startups raised more than $140 million in funding in 2013, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center, and Israel represents 13 percent of global cybersecurity research and development spending.Beer Sheva is fast becoming the epicenter of the Israeli cybersecurity community and a big part of that is thanks to the military units nearby. About 30,000 soldiers from relevant units  8200, computation, communication, cyber command  are located within close proximity to Beer Sheva or in Beer Sheva itself. The city also boasts Ben Gurion University, the first in Israel to offer cybersecurity grad studies and first in the country in the number of practical engineers it graduates.And positioned right in between the army units and the university is a new industrial park home to Deutsche Telecom, IBM, and Lockheed Martin research centers.The Israeli government's heavy investment in startup funding, and specifically in cyberdefense, plays it's part as well. Israel spends more on R&D relative to their size than any other country in the world.Early this year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened Israel's first Cybertech Conference, which was attended by more than 450 global heads of industry and cybersecurity agencies, including 50 from the White House and the US Department of Homeland Security. In his speech, he stressed his government's focus on growingIsrael's military-tech ecosystem.""Were putting our national cyber command smack in the University of Be'er Sheva. We have a railway line leading from Tel Aviv with a train station that literally you disembark on that point in the campus. So you have our security outfits, our university, and an industrial park all within walking distance of 100 yards,"" said Mr.Netanyahu.""Thats called a cyber-hub,"" he said.

The Christian Science Monitor,C,Shakespeare in Shanghai? The Bard takes China by storm - CSMonitor.com,"class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				
Beijing   When it comes to Great Britains soft power armory, William Shakespeare counts as heavy artillery. And London is rolling him out on the far shores of China these days in repeated cannonades.In Beijing last weekend, Shakespeares Globe Theatre ended a sold-out China tour of A Midsummer Nights Dream. A Chinese publishing house is now nearly finished compiling the Bards works in a scholarly new Mandarin translation. Moreover, the British government has just announced a $2.4 million project to launch a brand new Collected Works of Shakespeare translated specifically for todays Chinese stage.Shakespeare is one of our greatest cultural exports, beloved in China as well as here, British Finance Minister George Osborne said as he announced the new translation grant to the Royal Shakespeare Company in September.

The proletarian BardShakespeare, favorably viewed in earliest Communist days as an anti-capitalist, does not need much introduction to Chinese audiences. High school graduates are expected to know him and to have read at least excerpts of some of his plays.A survey earlier this year found that Chinese see Shakespeare as one of the top five positive British icons, says Nicholas Marchand, arts director in China for the British Council, the government body that promotes British culture worldwide. Its not only the queen and Benedict Cumberbatch, he adds.Shakespeare first became known in China in 1903, when Charles and Mary Lambs childrens version of some of his plays was translated as Strange Tales from Overseas. Since then many translations have appeared; after the Communist revolution Shakespeare became part of the acceptable foreign canon.That was because he was deemed by an official critic, Bian Zhilin, to have opposed the feudal system in the early part of his career and exposed the evils of capitalism in the later part, wrote Shakespeare scholar He Qixin.That kind of political focus sometimes led Chinese critics to see things in Shakespeares plays that Western audiences might not. The love between the star crossd lovers in Romeo and Juliet, for example, reflects the desire of the bourgeois class to shake off the yoke of the feudal ethical code, according to Lai Ganjian, a critic writing in 1979. Shakespeare has never fallen foul of Chinese censors.The Bard without the bawdyThis could also have something to do with the fact that until now, Chinese translators have deliberately skipped the naughty bits.None of the earlier Chinese editions have taken the sexual allusions into consideration,"" says Prof. Gu Zhengkun, a translator and chief editor of the translated collected works currently being published in Beijing. Translators have not rendered the bawdy words because they thought they would damage Shakespeares image as a moral writer.Though his works are studied, they are not often staged, says Joe Graves, an American theater director who has worked in China for more than 10 years. In that time, Mr. Graves has put on 18 professional productions of Shakespeares plays. What is wonderful,"" he says, ""is that very often it is the first time that people in the audience have seen the story, so they are unusually caught up in the plots.But a lot is missing, says Prof. Gu. So many translations sound like modern writing, commonplace novels, or plays, he complains.Even when the translations are beautifully poetic  many scholars point to Zhu Shenghaos classic versions, written in the 1930s  they are not necessarily faithful to the original texts. There are many inaccuracies in his work, and sometimes he misses the point, says Cheng Zhaoxing, one of Chinas top Shakespearean scholars.Playful poetry isn't easy to translateWe need new translations, but it is very difficult to offer something better, Prof. Cheng says. Good scholars are not always good translators or great poets in Chinese. Such combinations are quite rare.Shakespeares poetry is especially difficult to translate fully because of its often playful nature, says Perng Ching-hsi, a Taiwanese scholar who has just finished translating King Lear.Puns are particularly difficult to catch, but you cant stop a performance to explain a pun to the audience, Prof. Perng points out.Such is the challenge facing the translators whom the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) hopes to recruit to come up with fresh and catchy translations that will speak to modern Chinese audiences.The plan, says RSC spokeswoman Liz Thompson, is to have the writers and translators and interpreters embedded in the rehearsal room with the director and actors, watching them working on the words as they prepare English language productions in London and Stratford-upon-Avon.That way, Ms. Thompson hopes, they will make translations specifically for performance, looking at the text not as a piece of verse or prose but as something to be performed.The first fruit of this project should be a 2016 Chinese language production of The Merchant of Venice the first Shakespeare play ever presented in China, in 1913 on the 400th
anniversary of Shakespeares death. By 2023, the 400th
anniversary of the publication of the First Folio, his first collected works, the RSC hopes to have translated all 38 of Shakespeares plays into Chinese.Shakespeare is now owned by all the world, not just by English speakers, says Neil Constable, chief executive of Shakespeares Globe Theatre in London. He is a significant international brand; its good that everyone feels they have a part of him."

Washington  With the United States sitting on the sidelines, Arab and European countries alarmed at a steady uptick in tensions between Israelis and Palestinians are pushing ahead with efforts to get the two sides talking again and moving toward resolution of their long conflict.Optimism that a new international peace initiative can somehow do better than the Obama administrations failed foray into peace-process diplomacy earlier this year is close to zero. The US is preoccupied with the battle against the Islamic State and with talks aimed at securing a comprehensive deal with Iran on its nuclear program, while Israel will be distracted by the campaign leading up to elections now set for March.But at the same time a number of key powers, primarily in the Middle East and Europe, are increasingly concerned that doing nothing as tensions rise is a recipe for disaster.

			Israelis and Palestinians: A tense coexistence
		
Efforts under way in the United Nations Security Council to push Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table arise not just from growing frustrations over deteriorating conditions in the absence of diplomacy. They also reflect a sense that the two sides are less prone to take aggravating unilateral steps when they are in talks than when they retreat to their opposite corners, as is now the case.

The rekindled efforts out of the region in particular also debunk the notion that had been gaining traction in some Washington circles that the unresolved Palestinian issue is no longer the driving force among Arabs that it once was.The Arab League last week endorsed a Palestinian-drafted resolution that would recognize Palestine as a UN state and call for Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to end by November 2016. Jordan, which currently sits on the Security Council as a nonpermanent member, has begun circulating the resolution at the UN in New York. Jordanian diplomats have said they would like to see a resolution voted on by the end of the year.Three European powers  Britain and France, which are permanent members of the Council, and Germany  have drafted a separate and less confrontational resolution that would set a deadline of two years for negotiations culminating in a Palestinian state.One key question is where the US would come down on the resolutions.The Obama administration would almost certainly veto the Arab-backed version if it came to a vote  the US effectively killed the last bid by Palestinians to achieve statehood through the Security Council in 2011  but the wording of the less-definitive European version would probably determine the US position, some diplomatic experts say.Jordans King Abdullah sat down with President Obama at the White House Friday for a conversation that focused on the fight against the Islamic State (IS) and the challenges that the Syrian civil war presents to Jordan and other Syrian neighbors.The two leaders gave no indication that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was a focus of their discussion when they delivered brief statements to the press.We are going to continue to share ideas to move dialogue forward, Mr. Obama said. But he added that after the Gaza violence this summer and recent tensions in Jerusalem, the environment has not been conducive for the sort of peace initiatives that wed like to see.During his US visit, Abdullah repeated his position that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a core issue in the region that is exploited by extremists to gain favor with public opinion.In an interview with CBS News, he said the fight with IS is part of a war inside of Islam that must be led and owned by Muslims. But he said resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would benefit the entire global community. The official US stance on the conflict since Secretary of State John Kerry threw in the towel on his peace effort in April remains unchanged: that the only way to two states living side by side in peace is through direct negotiations between the two sides. To get back to talks, the US adds, both sides must avoid unilateral actions that raise tensions and make direct talks more difficult  whether it's Palestinian recourse to international bodies like the Security Council or Israeli expansion of housing developments on Palestinian lands.Our position on this hasnt changed, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday when asked about the US response to diplomatic efforts in the Security Council. In order to get two states living side by side in peace and security, we believe the way to do that is through direct negotiations between the two parties themselves where they get to a final agreement on all the issues.The Obama administration has come under some criticism from pro-Palestinian forces who say the US has acted to stop Palestinian authorities unilateral actions, while going no further than verbal rebukes of Israel when it has taken unhelpful unilateral steps.But there are some indications that the White House, growing increasingly frustrated with Israeli actions  in particular concerning accelerated settlement expansion  could move toward more concrete actions to underscore displeasure with Israel.White House officials refuse to confirm that discussions are taking place on a tougher US response to settlement activity, but some Israeli officials, speaking with the Israeli press, have said that US officials have told them that such talks have been under way since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus White House visit in early October.That visit was accompanied by a rush of settlement activity, including announcement of construction of more than 2,500 housing units in East Jerusalem.What remains unclear is what form any US action might take. Some UN diplomatic experts have speculated that the administration might decline to use the US veto in the Security Council if a resolution condemning Israel for the settlement activity were to come up.Or, others wonder, might the US decide to go along with a European resolution that ups the pressure on Israel to get back to talks?A tougher stance against Israel is not sitting well with some members of Congress.Not only is the Administration rejecting new sanctions to end Irans nuclear threat, it's now reportedly developing sanctions against our closest ally, Israel,"" Sen. Mark Kirk (R) of Illinois said in a statement. ""This move only worsens perceptions that the Administration treats our friends like enemies and our enemies like friends."

They forced you to get rid of any hope, to let go of your dreams, says Yusuf, speaking through wafting shisha smoke as the Arab Idol singing contest played out on TV.He never again saw his home. But he is one of many of the more than 3 million other Syrians, who, despite being forced to leave their country  and the fight for freedom and democracy  still hold on to hope for the revolution from the sidelines.They are on the edge of their seats now, fearing that US-led airstrikes on the Islamic State are helping the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and weakening Syrian rebels more than the jihadists.Nevertheless, the refrain heard from Syrians ranging from a former air force colonel to exiled protesters, is simple: We must hope. Without hope, we cannot live.A country of institutions, not intelligence servicesAwad al-Hamed pads barefoot across his cold Amman apartment to retrieve a heavy black briefcase. He sits down and puts it on his knees, opening the lid on past days as a respected lawyer in southern Syria, and retrieves a nametag.In February 2011, after uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt had ousted two of the Middle Easts longstanding rulers, and protests had broken out in Syria, Mr. Hamed was invited to a regional conference in Deraa organized by the ruling Baath Party.Syria is going to hell, and we want to know all your suggestions, because we want to find a solution, he recalls the head of the conference saying.He responded, We have one request: that this be a country of institutions, not mukhabarat (intelligence services).The man asked what he meant.If you are mocking me, this is not good, Hamed remembers saying. And if you dont understand what Im talking about, this is a disaster.The protests spread quickly across Syria, and Mr. Assads regime turned increasingly violent. Hamed fled via an official border crossing the next year, his wife Zeinab following weeks later on foot with relatives, bullets whizzing through the cold night air around them.While his immediate family made it across safely, Hamed recently lost his 65th relative to the fighting, and struggles to keep his four university-aged children in school. Still, he dreams of the day when harmony will return to Damascus and the sound of church bells and the shouts of Allahu akbar! from the mosque will once again be heard together.The most important motto of this revolution is, God, youre our only hope,  says Zeinab, who insists on turning on the heater for her two guests, despite the cost.A long drive in the snow for 180 bulletsIn six hours of talking about his role in the revolution, kneeling on the floor of his familys spare apartment outside Amman, M. al-Khalil speaks in calm, measured tones  even when discussing the deaths of two of his four sons in the fighting, or showing where a bullet passed through his bicep.But when it comes to what he sees as the failure of other countries to support the revolution, he breaks down.I dont cry for food when I have an injured man at the border of a neighboring country, and they wont let him in, and he dies in my arms, says the weathered fighter, a respected leader in Hameds hometown of Busra al-Shams, where he has remained except for brief respites to see his family in Salt, Jordan. Busra is some 22 miles from the city of Deraa.Has that happened more than once?Many times, he replies, almost in a whisper, abruptly leaving the room as his eyes brim over.While Arab countries have provided some weapons and cash to Syrian rebels, it wasnt nearly as much as promised, he says.From the camel, we got an ear, says Mr. Khalil, who in the early days of the fighting would forage for ammunition, once riding a motorbike through deep snow to buy 180 Syrian army bullets from a middleman.Freedom is so expensive, the patriarch says, adding that the US-led airstrikes against Islamic State, the strongest jihadist group, have emboldened the Syrian regime. We feel the regime starts to act freely and she controls a lot of areas which we won with our blood.But, he adds, we believe God will give us the victory in the end, whether you help us or not.US aerial campaign against Assad is possibleAs a colonel in the Syrian Air Force, it was his dream to get an order to bring down an Israeli plane.Instead, he found himself stuck in a job where he had to pay bribes to go on vacation and lived in a closely guarded compound.One of only seven Sunnis among 300 officers, once the revolution broke out he was detained seven times and accused of encouraging soldiers to fight the regime.Fifteen months into the uprising, he says, he and his family were separated during a spate of regime shelling in Damascus, and he sent them to stay with family near Busra. Speaking from his basement apartment in southern Amman, he requests anonymity because he is considered a traitor by the regime.After he defected to the rebels, he got caught in a Damascus suburb under siege, where he found a woman sobbing in the dark. A female neighbor on the regime side of the square had killed her last child with an ax, she told him.He secured a civilian ID card from an Assad supporter who had been killed, shaved his beard to match the photo, and sneaked through the checkpoint on the road south to join his family.As an officer who specialized in anti-aircraft missiles, he is highly skeptical of US claims that imposing a no-fly zone over Syria or launching airstrikes on regime forces  as NATO did in Libya  is difficult here because of Syrias air defenses, saying the US has the technology to fight such defenses effectively.He, like many Syrians, is deeply frustrated with President Barack Obamas failure to take decisive action in Syria as some members of Congress have advocated, at one point kissing his fingers and shouting, I love you John McCain!Obama always said, If Assad does this, this is a red line. Im trying to invent a new color for Obama, because red is not enough for him, he says, criticizing the limited airstrikes on IS as ineffective and tangential to what he sees as the real need: removing President Assad. If you have a disease or a pain in your head, should I come and treat your arm?Convinced that right will prevailBut despite the widespread feeling that regional and global powers have abandoned or even hijacked their revolution, Syrians are urging the rebels on from the sidelines.The Syrian revolution is one of the greatest revolutions in all of history, says Mohammed, Yusufs twin. We paid a lot, we paid blood, we paid a whole generation, and at the end, the right will have the victory. Because this revolution [was fought] against injustice, corruption, and dictatorship.And they are willing to hold on until the end.Even if we dont live [to enjoy] the results of our revolution, our kids will, says Yusuf.If he gets married, that is. He worked two jobs for three years in Syria to save up for marriage, and then spent it all to bribe his way out of compulsory military service for a year. His sweetheart married someone else after he fled to Jordan.Now hed rather go join the rebels.Ahmad Bayer provided translation."

Frankfurt  Under an unprecedented power-sharing deal between center-left parties and the successor of the SED communist party that ruled Eastern Germany for almost five decades, the German state of Thuringia on Friday became the first to be governed by a premier with communist roots since reunification.The election of trade unionist Bodo Ramelow of Die Linke (The Left) party breaks 24 years of conservative control of the ex-communist region. More importantly, some say, it marks the acceptance of the one-time communist party into political society, where Die Linke will fill a political left position long regarded as untouchable in Germany's post-cold war era.But for many Germans, it also stirs memories of the oppressive communist past of East Germany (GDR)  a past that some say Die Linke members have yet to sufficiently condemn or atone for. Many associate Die Linke with its former incarnation, the communist SED. And the SED controlled the Stasi, East Germany's intelligence agency, which infiltrated almost every aspect of peoples lives with the help of hundreds of thousands of staff workers and informers.

We are saying Never a SED dictatorship again, no Stasi spies in the government,' said organizer Stefan Sandmann. The rally, a quarter century after the Berlin Wall fell, shows that Germany is still struggling with its communist past and what place, if any, Die Linke should be given today.Die Linke returnsRamelow takes over leadership of Thuringia as part of a coalition between Die Linke, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), and Die Grnen (""The Green"") party. The new government, often referred to as ""red-red-green"" for the respective colors of the three parties, now holds a single-seat majority in the central German state's parliament. It replaces a government led by the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the party that has controlled Thuringia since reunification.The CDU has been in power longer than Ive lived, says SPD representative Kevin Gross, who is in his early 20s. It is time to give Die Linke responsibilities and let people decide if it should be in the government or not.Experts say the ascension of Die Linke is an important symbol. The party has participated in government coalitions in Brandenburg and Saxony, other ex-Eastern Germany states, but only as junior partners. Political scientist Werner J. Patzelt of Dresden University says Die Linkes getting the state premiers post is the normal continuation of post-cold-war Germany's political evolution.Its a sign that German reunification has come to an end, Mr. Patzelt says.Former informersBut for those who lived in the GDR, Die Linke  which only this fall agreed to include in its platform that the East German regime had been an ""unjust regime""  has more to do to address a history in which some of its members played a role.Die Linke parliamentarian Frank Kuschel of the Thuringian town of Ilmenau was one of those whose Stasi activities as informer are well known. Shortly before giving his vote to Ramelow Friday, Mr. Kuschel said he had apologized to victims but that I expect from a modern democracy to be given a chance to learn from my mistakes. Kuschel is one of two former SED members who actively collaborated with the regime.When youve worked for the Stasi and spied on so many people, you cant stand on the podium and be a candidate, says Christel Willinski, a resident of Ilmenau. Ms. Willinski has supported the SPD since reunification, but said she would leave the party over its new coalition with Die Linke.She says Die Linke is an unrepentant heir to the SED, under whose rule she was prevented from finishing school, getting her own apartment, or even choosing the vacation destinations she wanted. It was daily pinpricks, constant harassment.Die Linke is a party that hasnt come to terms with its past,"" she says. ""And if the SPD choses to work with that party, then its not my party anymore.Many critics of Die Linke want to know who collaborated with the Stasi, and whether former informants have genuinely expressed remorse to victims. Political scientist Oliver Lembcke of the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena said that to have members of the former SED like Kuschel hold such high-profile political positions sends the ""wrong message.""A lot of Germans will read the election of Ramelow as a process of normalization. Theyll say, now after 25 years, its time to move on; things have changed a lot, says Dr. Lembcke. But then many others will say, why are people who have inflicted such harm to others still sitting in parliament, why do they remain leading political voices?'German President Joachim Gauck gave the debate a moral dimension. People my age who experienced the GDR will have real trouble swallowing this, Mr. Gauck, a civil rights activist of the GDR who used to head the Stasi archives, said this fall. We... respect decisions by the people, but at the same time we have to ask ourselves: Is this party really far enough removed from the ideas once held by the [SED] so that we can now fully trust it?""'Not the SED anymore'Many insist that Die Linke has changed. The party isnt the SED anymore, the SPD's Mr. Gross says. He says he understands the fears of victims of the GDR regime, but our role is to lessen their fear, to show, maybe in five years, that a red-red-green coalition can work.Patzelt of Dresden University says that Die Linke has become a normal leftist party. To me the important things is that the Die Linke no longer denies that GDR was a dictatorship, that this past political system was best to get rid of,  he says.But like him, many acknowledges that there is still work to be done, particularly on the part of individuals within the party.Those who have been supporters [of the East German communist regime] have trouble saying, well, it is a part of my life that went in the wrong direction. This is something one can hope for, but that cannot be forced on them."

Glover, Vt.  Peter Schumann  baker, puppeteer, and founder and director of the Bread and Puppet Theater  began playing with puppets some 75 years ago in Silesia, now part of Poland, when he was just a boy.He was 10 years old in 1944 when the rumbling of Russian tanks accompanied by the crackle and pop of artillery fire forced his family to flee their home. Every night we saw what we called Christmas trees in the sky, Mr. Schumann recalls as he rolls lumps of raw dough on a rough table next to his Quebec-style clay oven on a gray autumn day in Glover, Vt.The Allies used the Christmas trees to illuminate the ground beneath their bombers to find their targets, he continues. They were beautiful fireworks. But when we saw them light up in the sky, we knew that bombs would fall.

I brought bread, a book of Brothers Grimm fairy tales, and hand puppets, Schumann recalls. Eventually we got on an overcrowded train. People were hanging like grapes from the train.... We were the lucky ones who made it out.The items Schumann chose to pack are telling: Refugees carry only those things that matter most to them.Flash forward to July 23, 2014. Schumann had become one of the foremost practitioners of experimental puppet theater in the world. After reading reports on the escalating situation in Gaza, where the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was playing out with devastating results, Schumann felt the need to respond.He halted Bread and Puppet Theaters summer program, three shows performed weekly from June through September, and he decided to remount Fire, a silent play for a combination of masked performers and mannequins that hed created in response to Americas involvement in Vietnam back in 1965-66.The show, now called Fire: Emergency Performance for Gaza, would challenge his collaborators. But they agreed to perform it the following Friday, leaving little more than a day for rehearsals.Its not an easy play to do, Schumann explains. Its so concentrated  the movement, the degree of focus required of the performers and the audience. Its a piece where you cant think of anything else. Otherwise you cant do it.The majority of Schumanns performers had no experience with that kind of theater. But he has always worked with little time, scant resources, untrained performers, and, perhaps most important, a singular devotion to his cause.Schumann and his wife, Elka, had moved to the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1961. Judith Malina, who cofounded The Living Theatre with her partner, Julian Beck, offered Schumann a performance space in the East Village.I knew Peter was a great artist the first time we met, Ms. Malina says. An artist has to have some idea of what theyre fighting for, and what theyre against. Peter Schumann has always known.In 1963, Schumann founded the Bread and Puppet Theater in New York City. He also worked a series of odd jobs to support his family, but he knew that more than anything he needed to devote his life to his art.After years of struggle, Schumann finally combined a way to make a living and his desire to make art by working with underprivileged children in New York. We did big workshops with kids in Harlem, South Bronx, and Bedford-Stuyvesant, he says. But it always felt like, when the project was finished, I was walking out on those kids.I remember going back to central Harlem after working with the kids there. The gangs were too powerful. The kids were imprisoned on their own block, so I took them to Coney Island one day to see the ocean. It was amazing. They lived so close to the sea, but they had never seen it.Schumann had first performed Fire in 1965 because, as he puts it, The horror of what America did in Vietnam, and the Buddhist monks response, setting themselves ablaze, was so shockingly hurtful.... His voice trails off. We wanted the littlest movements, the littlest bursts of outrage, the simplest gestures as possible. We needed the deepest, simplest possible means to communicate that horror.Schumann and company faced criticism.Naturally, there were confrontations, he says. When we did Fire in Atlanta, as part of a student uprising at Emory [University], a police helicopter dropped tear gas on us. But we had a circus tent that protected us. The play made some people angry.Still, we had to do it.Why did he have to do it? Schumanns eyes light up. The wrongs have to be attacked, he says.Christian Dupavillon  who at the time was curator of the Nancy Theatre Festival in France  was beside himself after attending a performance.The imagery, the use of silence, it was shocking, Mr. Dupavillon recalls 50 years later, now living in Cambridge, Mass. Ill never forget it. After the show, I immediately invited Schumann to perform Fire at Nancy. The show was perpetually sold out.By 1968 Fire was a success. Indeed, it afforded Schumann and the Bread and Puppet Theater needed financial stability.John Bell, director of the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry in Storrs, Conn., worked with Bread and Puppet from 1975 to 1985. He says Schumann totally changed puppetry in the United States.I was taught to put distance between yourself and the material, in the way that Shakespeare and Ibsen did, Dr. Bell says. They removed themselves from their own time and place and put their problems somewhere else.Peter made it possible to make shows about who we are, the problems we face.Schumann resists the idea that hes made a significant contribution to the worlds of theater and activism. But the Rev. Dr. Robert Brashear, pastor of West Park Presbyterian Church in New York, disagrees with him.For one reason or another, Mr. Schumanns work goes largely unnoticed, he says in a phone interview. And yet I remember seeing Bread and Puppet pieces at so many protests and social action events over the years. Hes completely changed the visual aspect of social change. Really, Mr. Schumanns work has become the defining visual imagery used in protests today.Today Schumanns focus remains on his work. He doesnt seek recognition. To bake bread, to feed the audience, and to make puppet shows that shout and claw at human follies seems to be enough for him.After the companys first performance of Fire: Emergency Performance for Gaza, Schumann stood among the audience in the theaters museum. It was a warm Friday night in July. The audience had silently gathered after the show to eat sourdough rye bread, slathered with aioli.These performers did an amazing job, Schumann says to a friend. Theyve never done this kind of work. And with only one rehearsal, they couldnt have done better.The performers success depends upon their ability to connect with the material, he says. The play will affect the audience on the condition that it affects the performer. The performer who is effective at what he does isnt effective because of his performing skills, but because of his commitment to what hes doing there, performing.The same may be said of Schumanns career. The source of his success lies in his commitment to his work. Some of the performers discovered this in themselves while performing Fire: Emergency Performance for Gaza. But Schumann had begun to discover it when he was a boy with his puppets, looking out the window of a cramped train, creeping across the German countryside.

The Christian Science Monitor,C,Rolling Stone backs off story of alleged fraternity rape at UVA - CSMonitor.com,"class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				Rolling Stones managing editor Will Dana published a note Friday admitting discrepancies in an account last month of an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity.But the statement has left many questions unanswered, further stoking the debate over not just universities handling of rape allegations but also the best practices for journalists attempting to bring such stories to light.The note explained that during months of reporting there were no reasons to doubt the credibility of Jackie, the main subject of the story. It also said that the magazine decided not to contact the man she claimed to have orchestrated the attack, out of fear of retaliation against her.

For some, thats enough to cast doubt on the entire account  which prompted a police investigation and a suspension of fraternities at UVA.It now looks like a hoax to me, writes Hans Bader, a Washington lawyer and former US Department of Education lawyer (and, coincidentally, a 1991 graduate of UVA) in an email to the Monitor. Those who presumed the fraternitys guilt on the way to drawing sweeping, broad-brush conclusions about rape culture should not have jumped to those conclusions.But for advocates of rape survivors, inconsistencies in Jackies account may simply be attributable to the effects of trauma, and shouldnt automatically be interpreted as nullifying her credibility.Such an apology really does have a huge ripple effect, and unfortunately fuels people who disbelieve victims, says Laura Dunn, a campus rape survivor and founder of the legal advocacy group SurvJustice. I still believe something horrible happened to [Jackie].One of the key points of debate about how the Rolling Stone story was reported centers around the decision not to contact the men Jackie accused.Although the men were not named in the story, some critics have argued that getting their response is a basic form of due diligence, while others have pointed out that many crime stories have been reported without contacting the accused directly.If Jackie had disclosed the names and Rolling Stone had contacted them, Jackie would have been vulnerable to retaliation and possibly defamation lawsuits, Dunn says, so the decision by Rolling Stone was an understandable approach.Privacy is a huge concern when talking with survivors. Its tough to tell your story, says Tracy Cox, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC). The reporter in this case appears to have taken a victim-centered approach, she says, and maybe the editor should have thought, OK, well were either going to not name the fraternity or interview others to round out her coverage, she says. Thats not my call to make.We hope reporters would not be discouraged from telling these important stories and that the fallout from the Rolling Stone article will not discourage victims from coming forward, Ms. Cox adds.Journalists having trouble verifying a sensitive account about sexual assault have another option, says Lauren Klinger of The Poynter Institute, a teaching center for working journalists: Why not be transparent with readers about why you are unable to verify certain parts of a story, she says.The part of Fridays editors note that Klinger says shes most uncomfortable with is that it suggests that inconsistencies in the account are the fault of Jackie. I would not feel comfortable blaming my source. If I make a mistake in my story, thats on me.It also leaves unclear to readers how much of the story should be doubted, which adds to the attitude victims often face in society that their stories arent believable, Klinger says.The Washington Post cast further doubt on the Rolling Stone article Friday when it reported: A group of Jackies close friends, who are sex assault awareness advocates at U-Va., said they believe something traumatic happened to her, but they also have come to doubt her account. They said details have changed over time, and they have not been able to verify key points of the story in recent days.Since 2013, Poynter and the NSVRC have offered an online self-directed class to journalists who want to be better informed about reporting on sexual assault.Phi Kappa Psis Virginia Alpha Chapter, allegedly the site of the gang rape, put out a statement Friday saying it can only provide limited comment because of an investigation by the Charlottesville Police Department.But the fraternity does note that no member was employed as a lifeguard at the universitys aquatic center. (In the article, the man said to have led the gang rape in 2012 was described as a lifeguard at a university pool). It also notes that the fraternity did not have a date function or social event the weekend of September 28th, when the incident was said to have taken place.In response to Fridays note in Rolling Stone and the Washington Post story, UVA President Teresa Sullivan issued a statement, which reads in part: Over the past two weeks, our community has been more focused than ever on one of the most difficult and critical issues facing higher education today: sexual violence on college campuses.Todays news must not alter this focus.We will continue to take a hard look at our practices, policies and procedures, and continue to dedicate ourselves to becoming a model institution in our educational programming, in the character of our student culture, and in our care for those who are victims, Ms. Sullivan said.The Monitor attempted to get information from the Charlottesville Police Department about the investigation Friday afternoon but has yet to hear back."
The Christian Science Monitor,C,Landrieu battle cry: 'The only poll that matters is on Election Day' - CSMonitor.com,"class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				The only poll that matters is on Election Day. This is the standard spin move of candidates who trail in public-opinion surveys and seek to discount them.Saying this doesnt guarantee defeat in the upcoming election, the Rothenberg Political Reports Nathan L. Gonzales observed, but it means you are losing the race at the time and have no empirical evidence to the contrary.The expression has been bandied about in the most prominent election left in the 2014 cycle: Saturdays Louisiana Senate runoff race between incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu  the last member of her party to represent the Deep South in the chamber  and Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy. Senator Landrieu, who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has pulled out the phrase in an attempt to refute numerous polls showing her far behind Representative Cassidy.

But Landrieu is just one in an extremely long line of politicians to utter or tweet some variation of this last-ditch battle cry. They include Democratic Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley, who used it just before losing last month to Republican Charlie Baker. Last year, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford also turned to it after he was caught on video smoking crack cocaine and his approval ratings took a nose dive.

But winning candidates and their backers say it, too  just to ensure their supporters dont get complacent and decide to stay home without voting.Louisiana GOP Gov.

				About 150 people marched peacefully to Phoenix police headquarters Thursday night to memorialize and protest the fatal shooting of 34-year-old Rumain Brisbon earlier this week by a police officer.The protesters focused on similarities to cases that have sparked outrage and activism nationwide: Like Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York, Mr. Brisbon was black and unarmed, and the officer responsible for his death was white.To the police  and to Brisbons mother  the case was not racially motivated. But the picture police paint of him is starkly different from the one his family and attorney put forward. Some witnesses have emerged with testimony contradictory to the police version of what happened during the Tuesday evening incident that left him dead.

In one version, Brisbon was a suspected drug dealer who fled and then got into a struggle with the officer, who thought Brisbon had his hand on a gun in his pocket. In the other version, he was a loving father innocently delivering fast food to his children.

Such different perceptions play into so much of the contact that minorities have with police that the demand for change has reached a sort of critical mass and will likely endure, says Tracie Keesee, a veteran police officer and co-founder of the Center for Policing Equity at the University of California in Los Angeles, which helps police apply social science research to improving their work.Nationally, there is exhaustion with this type of event, Ms. Keesee says. The community is saying, We get your job is dangerous  but are you doing everything in your authority to make sure you dont exacerbate the situation?.... When engaging communities of color are you doing it objectively?It will likely take months for the Phoenix police to complete their investigation into whether the shooting was justified, and that will be submitted to the Maricopa County Attorneys Office for review, says Jerry Cobb, Attorneys Office spokesman.We would like to see an independent agency investigate his murder instead of the organization that perpetrated it  and were waiting patiently for them to disclose the name of the officer who killed him, says Marci Kratter, a Phoenix attorney working with Mr. Brisbons family.The officer is a 30-year-old male who has been on the police force for seven years. He is currently on administrative leave.Brisbons family members want him to be remembered as a loving father and son rather than just another black man killed by police, Ms. Kratter says. Its not about race; its about the individual.The police have chosen to vilify the victim by talking about his past criminal history, Kratter says. The Arizona Republic reports that he was convicted of burglary in 1998 and had a marijuana conviction and several cases of suspected driving under the influence.According to the police account: The officer was investigating a report of drugs being sold from an SUV, and he drove to the apartment complex where the owner of the license plate was registered. He called for backup and then observed the driver get out of the SUV and remove something from the back seat. The officer commanded him to put his hands up, and when Brisbon put one or both hands in his waistband, the officer drew his weapon.Brisbon fled, and when the officer caught up to him, Brisbons hand was in his pocket and the officer ordered him to keep his hand there. When a woman opened the apartment door, they fell into the apartment. The officer lost his grip on Brisbons hand, and fearing Brisbon had a gun in his pocket the officer fired two rounds striking Brisbon in the torso, the police statement says.The item in Brisbons pocket was later determined to be a vial containing some oxycodone tablets, and a semi-automatic handgun was found on the drivers side floor of the SUV, the police account says.But Kratter and various media reports say some witnesses in the vicinity didnt hear an officer shouting any commands before the shooting. Kratter also says its not yet clear whether the police have linked the gun to her client, since there was another person in the car.Even if he did have a gun in the car, she says, does that really justify murdering somebody?Police spokesman Sgt. Trent Crump confirms in an e-mail to the Monitor that there was an additional person in the car who has been released at this point.Brandon Dickerson told the Arizona Republic that he was in the car with Brisbon and that Brisbon was dropping off fast food to his children. He did not see the officer try to talk with Brisbon and says his friend did not yell at the police, as the police account says.Whos gonna argue with police? Dickerson told the Republic. He had no death wish yesterday.The Rev. Jarrett Maupin helped organize the demonstration Thursday.The Phoenix police department does not treat white people this way, he said when pressed by interviewer Mark Curtis on 12 News/AZCentral.com about why this case has anything to do with race. Brisbon was simply delivering food to his children and was known by people at the apartment complex and was not a threat, Reverend Maupin said. Its wrong when we force people  to submit to aggressive and illegitimate stops and assaults by police.An assistant to Phoenix police chief Daniel Garcia attended Thursdays rally and spoke with community leaders this week to help ensure that protesters could peacefully exercise their First Amendment Rights, AZCentral.com reports.After an officer shoots someone, its easy to see afterward if that person was unarmed, but police officers sometimes have to decide if theres a threat to themselves or the community in the blink of an eye, Keesee of the Center for Policing Equity says.With that said, she adds, police departments do need to look at how they are training officers, and increasingly they are starting to focus on how to deescalate situations and consider the context of police tactics that may unnecessarily lead to encounters that are unsafe for police or suspects.Cops just dont like change because we absolutely rely on what we know: Ive used this technique in the past and its worked for me. We have to learn to be a little bit more flexible, but when we talk about making changes  we want rational minds prevailing over how the training is done, and that has to be a joint effort between communities and law enforcement, Keesee says."

Washington  The latest bit of intel from Wall Street suggests that Mitt Romney really is thinking of running for president again.A piece in Business Insider, headlined Romneys inner circle is convinced hes running, describes the Republican Partys 2012 nominee meeting with donors in New York earlier this week to lay the groundwork for a 2016 White House bid.Romney representatives have been mum on the meetings. But a senior Republican who has met with Romney tells Politicos Ben White that his pitch to Wall Street donors went like this: ""He tells people not to commit to a candidate that is not their first choice and that they aren't excited about. He does not think much of the current field and does not think it is jelling. He still views himself as the leader of the establishment wing of the Republican Party.

Its definitely a change in his message [tilted more toward running],"" the source adds. The Republican also says Romneys decision doesnt hinge on whether former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush gets in. ""He does not feel he owes the Bushes anything and does not think Jeb is the de facto leader of the establishment GOP, the source told Politico.

So, lets take all that as a definite maybe  perhaps a step or two more along the spectrum toward running than he was before those meetings last Monday. A third serious bid by Romney would be an anomaly. Usually, serious contenders who try twice and fail hang it up for good  people like former Sen. Bob Dole (R) of Kansas and Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona.But in Romneys case, the third time really could be a charm. And theres real potential for Republican success that wasnt there in 2008 or 2012. In 2008, even if Romney had won the nomination, chances were that then-Sen. Barack Obama was going to win anyway. President George W. Bush was deeply unpopular, and whoever the Democrats nominated was favored to win.In 2012, when Romney did win the nomination, President Obama was popular enough, and the economy doing well enough, for him to win reelection.Now, after two terms of Mr. Obama, 2016 should  in theory  be the Republicans turn to capture the White House. There are no guarantees, but the playing field should be more hospitable to the GOP than it was in 2008 and 2012.The question is: Will the Republican Party maximize its chances by nominating its strongest candidate for the general election? Were he to run, Romney would have to be considered a top-tier candidate. He can raise a ton of money, hes got gobs of national experience, his background is well-vetted, and his personal life is squeaky clean. Post-2012 polls have suggested a hint of buyers remorse among some Obama voters. Would Romney make more rich guy gaffes? Probably. But so might Hillary Rodham Clinton, if shes the Democratic nominee. Ms. Clinton has lived in a bubble since her husband threw in for the presidency in 1991, and since her time as first lady, has amassed considerable wealth.Romney and Clinton would also cancel each other out on their lack of new car smell, which Obama has suggested voters want in 2016.Maybe, in the end, another Republican rises to the occasion and captures the GOPs heart. But from the sound of it, Romney isnt convinced that his partys large, still-forming field necessarily contains the one.Romney is keeping his options open, says Republican strategist Ford OConnell.Because Romney already has high name recognition, he can afford to wait to get into the race  as late as July 2015, when the second-quarter fundraising reports come out. If nobody emerges by then as a strong candidate, then Romney could jump in.Hes positioning himself as the fallback guy, Mr. OConnell says.Many shoes will drop between now and then, for both parties. And its possible, if not probable, that Romney will stick with retirement  and regular appearances on Sunday morning news shows as a party sage. But as long as he keeps dropping in on donors on Wall Street, the buzz will continue that Romney 16 is a live possibility. "
The Christian Science Monitor,C,Landrieus last stand: why Deep South white Democrats are vanishing - CSMonitor.com,"class=""eza-body clearfix p402_premium"">
				
								
				
								
				
				
Washington  Come Saturday, the sweep is likely to be complete. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) of Louisiana is nearly certain to lose her runoff election against Republican challenger Bill Cassidy. In the Deep South, that will mean no more Democrats in the US Senate, a governors office, or the majority in a state legislature.This shift to deep red in the Deep South has been decades in the making. And it was only a matter of time before Louisiana was going to shift, too, analysts say. Still, one statistic stood out in Senator Landrieus vote totals on Election Day last month: She got only 18 percent of the white vote, down from 33 percent just six years ago.Why the precipitous decline? And what does it signal for Democrats future chances in the South?

			Seven new members of Congress to watch
		
To the first question, experts on Southern policies have a short answer: President Obama. He is deeply unpopular in Louisiana and across the South, making it extremely difficult for a senator who has voted for his policies the vast majority of the time to survive. All the Democratic Senate incumbents in red states lost on Election Day, except for Landrieu (who came in first at 42 percent, well below the majority needed to avert a runoff). Even Sen. Mark Warner (D) of Virginia, now a purple state, nearly lost.

The longer answer to why the bottom fell out of Landrieus white vote goes to larger regional trends. White Southerners have been moving to the GOP for decades, starting with the civil rights era of the 1960s. Social issues  abortion, gay rights, guns  still loom large in the South, and culturally, the national Democratic Party is out of sync with most white voters there.White Louisiana voters are really just catching up to where white voters in Mississippi and Alabama were a decade or so ago, says Michael Henderson, a political scientist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This has a lot less to do with Landrieu than with the long transition in Louisianas political landscape.Louisianas march to red has been slow, in part because of its large Catholic vote  about a quarter of the states population, larger than in other Deep South states.The attachment to New Deal economics persisted longer among Catholic voters in Louisiana, says Brian Brox, a political scientist at Tulane University in New Orleans. They switched over to the social-issues agenda  abortion, gay marriage, prayer in schools, education vouchers  a bit later than the largely Evangelical Protestant white vote in many of these other Deep South states.Landrieu is Catholic and calls herself pro-life, which has helped her in the past. But in 2014, her support for the Affordable Care Act hurt her, beyond the general distaste for the law in her state. The laws provision for contraception and a widespread belief that it covers abortion were a negative among Catholic voters.Another element of Obamas record that has hurt Landrieu is his approach to energy, the economic engine of Louisiana. After the 2010 Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Obama suspended oil drilling there for six months. He has also delayed a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline. Working to Landrieus benefit is Louisianas large black population  32 percent of the state, second only to Mississippi as a percentage. The vast majority vote Democratic. But on Saturday, there likely are not enough additional black votes to make up for the vastly reduced white Democratic vote.Many African-Americans left Louisiana because of hurricane Katrina in 2005 and never came back. In 2008, the last time Landrieu won reelection, it was the year of Obama, and the massive black turnout he inspired also boosted Landrieu to victory on Election Day.She got plenty of black votes to offset the fact that, over time, white Louisianans who identify as Democratic are either changing [party] or dying, says Mr. Brox. And that process of white political transition is accelerating. Six years later, there was no African-American running for president to turn out black votes. The numbers are just catching up with her.Indeed, while Landrieu has won election to the Senate three times, she has never won big. Her victory in 2008 was her biggest, at just 52 percent.One Southern state that already saw Democrats swept out of statewide office this cycle was Arkansas. Both the governors and Senate races went Republican  including the defeat of incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor (D), who, like Landrieu, brought a family brand name to the race.The Clintons helped hold back the shift in Arkansas, much as Jimmy Carter held it back in Georgia, says Merle Black, an expert on Southern politics at Emory University in Atlanta.In addition, Arkansas has a big population of Evangelical white Christians. Thats the most anti-Democratic group across the South, says Mr. Black. They dont see President Obama advancing their interests. They see a national Democratic Party as hostile or indifferent to them.Arkansas doesnt have a big black population, relatively speaking. So the shift there is not about the politics of racial mobilization, its about cultural conservatism.But across much of the South, home to some of the nations largest black populations, racial bifurcation is the name of the game. Blacks vote largely Democratic, whites vote largely Republican. After the loss of Rep. John Barrow (D) of Georgia on Nov. 4, there will be no white Democrats representing the Deep South in the House.One bright spot for Democrats on Election Day was the victory of Gwen Graham in Florida, who beat incumbent Rep. Steve Southerland (R). The district includes the state capital of Tallahassee, also home to Florida State University, so even though its in the Florida Panhandle, its not typical Deep South.And what about the future? Is it game over for Democrats in the South? Not necessarily. Nine of the 10 states with the fastest growing Hispanic populations are in the South, and Hispanics tend to vote Democratic. North Carolina, which voted for Obama in 2008 but not 2012, and voted out Sen. Kay Hagan (D) on Election Day, still holds potential for Democrats. The party has also long had its sights on Texas and Georgia, and even though Democratic candidates failed there on Nov. 4, both the rise of minority populations and in-migration of Northerners give Democrats hope that both states can at least become purple battlegrounds someday.The question is, when. Curtis Wilkie, a former reporter for The Boston Globe and Mississippi native, paints a dire picture.I cant remember it being any gloomier for Democrats in the South than it is today, Mr. Wilkie, now a scholar at the University of Mississippi, told CNN. The party has been demonized by Republicans. Its very bleak. I just dont see anything good for them on the horizon.On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee announced a task force aimed at improving party performance, after the drubbing of 2014. But chances are, the real task of party rebuilding will fall to its 2016 presidential nominee, perhaps former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. At one time, she was closely associated with the centrist wing of the party, alongside her husband, former President Clinton.Whether she can succeed may depend on the policies she advocates. Right now, says Black, shes very closely identified with the Obama administration, having been a part of it."
The Weekly Standard,C,What Do Illegal Immigrants Want? | The Weekly Standard,"
The predictable furor over President Obamas executive order offering relief to approximately 5 million undocumented immigrants has obscured the fact that his initiative is much bolder in form than in content. Obama has gone to extraordinary lengths to offer less than what immigrant advocates have for years been insisting is an absolute necessity: full citizenship.NEWSCOMIf Obamas initiative should prove to be the first step on the path to citizenship for these undocumented, it is a hobbled and halting one, and the path long and tortuous. It is difficult to believe that this or any Congress now on the horizon will be willing to affirm Obamas initiative. Neither is it likely, though perhaps less easy to predict, that Congress will risk the political consequences of rescinding it.
It is even more difficult to imagine a president in the foreseeable future unilaterally granting this population any more than Obama has, apart from perhaps extending the orders three-year limit. Similarly, the odds are against any future chief executiveespecially a Republicanterminating Obamas program. So rather than direct these 5 million individuals down a path to citizenship, Obama has almost certainly consigned them to legal limbo.
Not surprisingly, immigrant advocates have already started pushing back and demanding more. What is surprising is that the undocumented do not seem to share the same sense of urgency. On the contrary, most seem willing to settle for much less than full citizenshipin particular, for legal status that allows them to live here without fear of deportation and to travel back and forth to their country of origin to visit family, which Obamas order will allow them to do. In other words, the undocumented are not as concerned with attaining citizenship as their advocates have long and strenuously argued.

Immigration MalpracticeNo Kidding Problems of the Second Generation  It Takes Two Welcome to America   
 


There is abundant evidence to support this assertion. First, there are ethnographic studies of undocumented immigrants from Ireland, Guatemala, and Mexico, revealing their intentions to return home and their consequent indifference to, or at least ambivalence about, any permanent tie with the United States.
Second, there are the results of the amnesty granted to nearly 2.7 million illegal immigrants by the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. According to data published by the Department of Homeland Security, as of 2009 (nearly a quarter-century after the IRCA amnesty program began), barely 41 percent had exercised the option to become U.S. citizens. The other three-fifths remain legal permanent residents.
A recent study from the Pew Hispanic Center reinforces this point by scrutinizing naturalization rates for legal immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Drawing on Current Population Survey data, Pew reports that, as of 2011, only 36 percent of the 5.4 million legal immigrants from Mexico eligible to become U.S. citizens had taken that step. The naturalization rate for legal immigrants from Central America was somewhat higher44 percent. By contrast, the rate for all legal immigrants, regardless of country of origin, was much higher61 percent.
Drawing an inference from these data about legal immigrants and the implications for the controversy over illegal immigrants (of whom about three-fifths come from Mexico), Pew offers this understated but striking conclusion: The Centers analysis of current naturalization rates among Mexican legal immigrants suggests that creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally does not mean all would pursue that option.
There are several factors to consider in explaining these numbers, not the least of which is the proximity of the immigrants country of origin to the United States. Also relevant is the evidence from numerous studies highlighting that illegal immigrants, especially from Mexico and Central America, typically arrive here as target earners who have specific earnings goals and do not intend to settle here permanently. To meet their goals, they maximize income by working long hours and minimize expenses by living in Spartan, often substandard conditions.
Granted, such migrants put down roots. Their goals shift, and target earners typically end up remaining, though the notion of one day returning home often lingers for many years. Activist lawyer Jennifer Gordon, who sought unsuccessfully to organize a union of undocumented Central American day laborers in suburban Long Island, has aptly characterized such individuals as settlers in fact but sojourners in attitude. No wonder that securing U.S. citizenship is not a priority for many such immigrants.

The Weekly Standard,C,No Justification | The Weekly Standard,"
With his aggressive executive action on immigration, President Obama has struck a constitutional nerve in the body politic. The first lawsuit challenging the presidents action was filed last week by a coalition of 18 states led by Texas. Oklahoma is about to file, and other states may do so as well.NEWSCOMAs for the two houses of Congress, House Judiciary Committee chairman Robert Goodlatte told The Weekly Standard that the House should litigate the issue. Probably a majority of his colleagues agree. Goodlatte expects that soon after the new Congress is sworn in, the House will authorize the filing of a complaint that the new Republican Senate will then vote to join.
A sense of urgency is evident on the part of the lawyers involved in this challenge to the president. Goodlatte wants Congress to ask for expedited review of its case, and already the legal arguments against the president are starting to take shape.
The fundamental complaint is that the president has violated the Constitution, in particular the separation of powers. The Constitution vests Congress, not the president, with all legislative powers herein granted. And under law duly passed by Congress (and signed by the president), anyone entering the country illegally is a deportable alien who shall upon the order of the Attorney General be removed.

The Constitution also provides that the president shall take care that the laws are faithfully executedthe so-called take care clause. Faithful execution of the deportation law, as Obamas critics see it, should continue to require, as a rule, the removal of every illegal alien. But the president instead is implementing a policy prioritizing the removal of certain categories of aliens over others. The policy provides deferred actiona temporary reprieve from deportationfor undocumented parents of children who are citizens or lawful permanent residents. Up to five million illegal aliens are in this group.
Obama has justified his policy in law enforcement terms as an effort to make better use of the limited resources available to the Department of Homeland Security for enforcing the immigration laws; in humanitarian terms as an effort to help families of aliens stay intact; and in political terms as something he had to do because Congress failed to enact his approach to immigration reform. But for Goodlatte and others in Congress, and for a large number of state attorneys general, Obamas action constitutes nothing less than a usurpation of congressional power.
Of course, the presidents lawyers see it differently. Obama sought advice from the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel, the elite unit of lawyers who provide nonpartisan (but executive-branch sympathetic) counsel to the president and the agencies. And in its 33-page memorandum, OLC says the presidents action does not raise a constitutional issue and is justified as a proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion.
That concept, says OLC, is rooted in the Presidents constitutional duty to take care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Prosecutorial discretion is most commonly used in the context of criminal law enforcement, in decisions to charge (or not) particular individuals with a crime. The administration is using it in the immigration context to designate for deferred action a large class of undocumented aliens. Thus, individuals who meet the criteria for inclusion in the class, including having the necessary family relationship, are presumed not to be removable, with the threat of deportation lifted for at least three years, during which time these aliens may receive certain benefits, among them work permits.
OLC concedes that a general policy of non-enforcement that forecloses the exercise of case-by-case discretion poses special risks that the agency has exceeded the bounds of its enforcement discretion. Indeed, such a policy might even amount to a rewriting of the immigration laws or an abdication of the administrations statutory responsibilities with respect to non-priority aliens.
But, OLC says, the presidents policy doesnt prohibit case-by-case discretion; indeed, there are no removable aliens whose removal may not be pursued under any circumstance. Thus, discretion not to grant deferred action to an undocumented alien otherwise qualified for the temporary reprieve but who committed a serious crimesuch discretion is not entirely eliminated.

The Weekly Standard,C,Schieles Faces    | The Weekly Standard,"
In Hermann Hesses short story The Painter, a young artist experiences the pain of having his works shunned. Because his paintings are so unpopular, the artist becomes reclusive. He decides to stop depicting love, heroes, and celebrations in beautiful pictures that give pleasure to others. Instead, he begins painting discomfiting pictures that express his desire to turn to nothing and sink, die, and be reborn.Portrait of Dr. Erwin von Graff (1910)His friends become concerned with how quietly and strangely he begins speaking, how much more he is withdrawing into himself, and how much less interest he is taking in what was lovely and important for other people. People worry that he is going insane. But when they actually catch a glimpse of his new paintings, they discover a spectacular genius, to be sure, an eccentric, but one who was blessed by God. Critics pen enthusiastic reviews of his new style, and what they especially love are his incredible series of self-portraits: We may place them, they write, alongside the master-pieces of psychological portrait art.
Hesses dark fairy tale was most likely not written about the Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele, but it just as well could have been. Schieles art can be disturbing to look at todayand it would have been all the more so for early-20th-century Viennese. Yet eventuallyand mostly posthumously, for he died at 28his paintings were appreciated for what they are: the work of a strange, idiosyncratic, eccentric genius.

Like the majority of the great painters who preceded him, Egon Schiele (1890-1918) began his artistic career by painting traditional landscapes before moving on to paint the human figure. He attracted controversy for his sexually explicit paintings of young women and men, but even those perturbing works were not the paintings with which he would stake his legacy. His idiosyncratic painterly genius was not fully revealed until he began to explore his own tormented consciousness in a series of shocking self-portraits.
They are shocking not only for how they portray the human figure, but for how they portray the human psyche. Legend has it that Isaac Luria, the great 16th-century Kabbalist, could look into a persons face and see the sins upon the persons soul. In this regard, Schiele was the Kabbalist of 20th-century painters. To look into his portraits, he once said, is to look inside. Schieles self-portraits not only portray his anxious psyche, they allow us to peer inside Schieles agonized spirit and give us a glimpse of his morbid soul.
Schiele was a disciple of Gustav Klimt, the Neue Galeries patron artistic saint; but whereas Klimts figures are idealized and almost unrealistically beautiful, Schieles grotesque figuresdespite some clear stylistic affinities with his mentorcould not be more different.
By the 19th century, painting oneself as one really lookswarts and allwas no longer a revolutionary development in Western art. Schieles decidedly nonidealized self-portraits are unmistakably rooted in the tradition of Rembrandt and van Gogh. Even some of the Roman emperors, for a brief stretch of time after Augustus, preferred their busts to be sculpted in a nonhagiographic fashion. But whereas Rembrandt depicted his own physical flawsdeep wrinkles, tired eyes, sagging eyelids, all the thousand natural signs of age that many self-portraitists prior to Rembrandt sought to concealSchiele shocked (and still shocks) viewers in his unforgivingly unfavorable depiction of his own psyche.
Schieles brilliant yet unsettling style of portraiture is the solo act of this exhibition. The Neue Galerie has billed it as the first exhibition in an American museum to focus exclusively on Schieles portraits, and exclusive focus is precisely what is necessary to take in these difficult yet necessary imagesover 100 in all, encompassing paintings, sketches, and sculpture. The show charts Schieles development from young Viennese artist who arrived on the fin de sicle art scene with the verve of an arriviste to slightly older avant-garde Austrian Expressionist who bristled at Victorian moralism and broke with painterly conventions. 
The show also highlights Schieles portraits of family members, fellow artists, patrons, and lovers. But it is in his self-portraits that Schieles singular style of psychological art is most readily on display. His view of himself is of a person who is deeply, profoundly, irredeemably flawed: His hands are gnarled, his body is emaciated, his limbs are painfully contorted, his eyes are shriveled and withdrawing into the shadowy sockets of his crepuscular skull.

So what happens for Hong Kong when tomorrow comes? What of the pledges in the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the constitutional guarantees contained in the Basic Law that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would continue to enjoy a high degree of autonomy except for foreign and defence affairs. It shall be allowed to have executive, legislative and independent judicial power? Beijing gave its response when, according to a BBC report, the Chinese embassy informed a group of British MPs seeking to conduct an inquiry into the situation in the former crown colony that they would be denied entry into Hong Kong.
A major Beijing propaganda theme in attempting to deny the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong is that outside agitators, chiefly from the United Kingdom and the United States, are behind the wave of unrest. Chinas government mouthpiece, the Global Times, editorialized earlier this fall that the more [extremists] count on support from Washington and London, the more absolutely they will fail. President Obama was put on the defensive on Hong Kong by his Chinese hosts at the APEC summit. In a joint press conference with Xi Jinping, Obama declared, according to Hong Kongs South China Morning Post, On the issue of Hong Kong, I was unequivocal in saying to President Xi that the United States has no involvement in fostering the protest that took place there.
Xi responded with a stern warning that Hong Kong affairs are exclusively Chinas internal affair, and foreign countries should not interfere in those affairs in any form or fashion. Still, as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel pointed out in congressional testimony on December 3, the United States continues to have extensive commercial interests in Hong Kong, with more than 1,400 American companies investing there and with Hong Kong alone still representing the ninth-largest market for U.S. exports. But these economic ties alone cannot resolve political questions.
The political uncertainty hanging over Hong Kong is, of course, nothing new. In December 2004, while en route to the city, veteran congressman Henry Hyde succinctly summarized its ongoing dilemma. The danger, he observed, is that Hong Kong will end up being just another Chinese city. Hyde expanded on his concerns in a speech there. He observed: Whether or not the people of Hong Kong and the government in Beijing wish or even recognize it, the unique status and relative freedom of this former crown colony have made it the preeminent testing ground of the possibilities of Chinas political evolution, the most difficult and important test being whether greater freedom and democracy can be made compatible with the regimes insistence on order and stability.

Once upon a time, secretary of defense was something of a prestigious title. But if recent news is any indication, in the twilight of the Obama administration the gig is about as desirable as chicken sexer or sewer inspector. First, there is the ongoing fallout from former senator Chuck Hagels ouster from the job. Last week we learned that Hagel decided to resign a week earlier than the White House wanted him to out of spite. To Hagels credit, it appears that part of the friction between him and the White House stemmed from his discomfort with their plans to release more prisoners from Guantnamo. Its also worth noting that the White Houses foreign policy and military failures are legion and long predate Hagels tenure.Chuck HagelNEWSCOCMOther reports about Hagel have been less flattering, to put it mildly. Longtime military reporter Thomas Ricks noted that there were a lot of people in the Defense Department happy to see Hagel go because of his apparent incompetence and indifference. According to Ricks, he didnt exactly measure up to the standards set by his two immediate predecessors at the Pentagon. The 4-5 page briefing papers that Gates devoured, or the two-page memos that satisfied Panettas intellectual cravings, were replaced by Hagels preferred briefing material: an index card with 25 words on it. Policy papers were still drafted, but Hagels inner circle repeatedly made it clear they would never be read, Ricks reported. In fact, Hagel nearly caused international incidents because he was so unresponsive and ill-prepared for interactions with foreign officials.

It would be nice to have more clarity on what exactly happened, but based on what we know about the Obama White House and Hagels general acumen, The Scrapbook is assuming theres plenty of blame to go around on both sides. In fact, the White Houses behavior toward their nominee to replace Hagel suggests this new relationship is almost doomed before it ever really begins.
Former deputy secretary of defense Ashton Carter has been tapped to replace Hagel. Carter wasnt exactly a high-profile choicethe headlines The Scrapbook reads about him home in on the piquant details that hes a theoretical physics Ph.D. who once advocated unilaterally attacking North Koreas nuclear weapons program, which probably doesnt endear him to the Obama administration. As such, the White House took the extraordinary step of preparing him for the nomination process while letting it be known that they might also give him the hook. Even on Tuesday, as the final touches were [being put] on the White House plans to announce Carter, still another administration official said the White House was going back one more time to see if there were other possible higher profile candidates, wrote CNN reporter Barbara Starr last week.
Frankly, we wouldnt blame Carter if he were to withdraw his name from contention after such reprehensible treatment. If he does stick it out, we hope he rises to the challenges presented by a difficult job. We live in perilous times, regardless of how furiously the White House downplays the threats that are rapidly proliferating. Unfortunately, as long as the Obama administration is in charge, were lucky to have anyone in the job, competent or not.

The Weekly Standard,C,Menendez vs. the White House | The Weekly Standard,"
It's heartening these days to see an outbreak of bipartisan seriousness, given how rare those instances have become. Herewith some excerpts from a statement delivered by Bob Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at the committees December 3 hearing on Dismantling Irans Nuclear Weapons Program, which The Scrapbook enthusiastically cosigns:Sen. MenendezNEWSCOMWhile I believe the Administrations diplomatic efforts to terminate Irans illicit nuclear program should be commended, I am concerned that Iran has not demonstrated a sincere interest in reaching agreement and has used these talks to chip away at our positions, beginning with the concessions on enrichment in the Joint Plan of Action.
Given continued Iranian intransigence in the talks, the failure to conclude a final deal by November 24th falls squarely on Iran. Yet, for over one year, we remain trapped in the same fruitless, cyclical narrative which has us conceding our positionstransforming the Arak reactor rather than dismantling it; converting Fordow for some alternate use, rather than closing it; and disconnecting centrifuges, rather than destroying them. Andperhaps more significantlyIran isnt budging on full access to questionable sites and the duration of the agreement.
I understand that the P5+1 members want to put a year on the break-out clock, but I am not convinced a year is enough if we leave the majority of Irans nuclear infrastructure in place and give up the only leverage we have by providing sanctions relief. The one-year alarm will give us time to respond, but our only option at that point will be a military option. In my view, to suggest that we can quickly or easily rebuild the sanctions regime or replicate the economic pressure currently facing Iran is a false narrative.

For me, this equation is simpleIran must make up its mind about what is more important: its nuclear weapons program or thewelfare of its people. Clearly, for the last year Iran has not felt a need to make that decision.
Right now we are playing right into the Iranian narrative, so while they have maximized their demands at the negotiating table, we have minimized ours, with no consequences. This is a worst-case scenario, is extremely dangerous for global nonproliferation imperatives and for regional stability, and could leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state.
At the end of the day, if no deal is reached by March 24, Congressional action to authorize prospective sanctions may provide the leverage we need to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.
Irans nuclear weapons ambitionsand its continued obfuscation at the negotiating tablehave raised alarms throughout the Middle East and the international community. The risk of a nuclear arms race in the region is not hypothetical. We are seeing the repercussions of permitting Iran to retain an enrichment program resonate in the regionand in our 1-2-3 negotiations with other countries who are asking why they need to accept a no-enrichment standard when Iran will be allowed to enrich.
For me, the time has come to ask whether repeated negotiation extensions coupled with sanctions relief will ever result in a comprehensive deal. Iran benefits from successive rounds of unfreezing of assets abroad, and has not felt the need to make any real concessions beyond the requirements of the interim agreement.
The assumption seems to be that another extension will result in a good dealand all we need to do is continue negotiatingput more time on the nuclear breakout clock. My own perspective is more time wont make a difference. Tehrans desire for a nuclear program has not changedand it wont change. Iran is only negotiating because it wants economic relief and is betting that more time on the clock benefits its position.
Bottom line: I continue to believe we have the leverage in this negotiationand we should use it.

The Weekly Standard,C,Sermons for the King | The Weekly Standard,"
Speaking truth to power is easyor easier, anyway, than speaking truth to money. We might resist a sovereign who commands us to preach his favored doctrines. But a sovereign who slips us a little cash on the side, just for a sermon or twoon something we maybe dont really disagree with all that much? Harder. Much, much harder. It was true back in 1717, for example, when Benjamin Hoadly preached a famous Anglican sermon in front of a receptive King George Ia sermon that called for church government to be taken away from the bishops and given directly to the king.An Environmental Stewardship Action Group member at Maryland Presbyterian Church in Towson shows off a rain barrel.Kim Hairston / Baltimore sunAnd it isnt a surprise now in 2014, when Marylands Prince Georges County, just outside Washington, D.C., began issuing tax rebates to local churches. As it happens, those tax rebates do require a little something from the churchesa nod to the king, as it were. All the churches need to do to get the rebate is perform a little environmentalist ministry, according to a well-reported story in the Washington Post on November16. All they need to do is preach a little green.
Maryland has been on a tax spree over the past eight years, as the state government looked desperately for funds with which to support its social programs. An enormous majority of the states voters belong to the Democratic party; President Obama carried Maryland by 25 percentage points in 2012, and Democrats have held the governors mansion 41 out of the past 45 years. But the piling up of new taxes proved too much even for Maryland, and voters in the very blue state shocked pollsters this fall by electing Republican Larry Hogan their new governor.

The most unpopular of Marylands recent tax increases was what unhappy locals dubbed the rain tax and the state called its stormwater remediation fee, imposed on all property owners whose runoff drained into the Chesapeake Bay. The cost of the environmentalist measure is spread evenly across business properties, private houses, and buildings owned by nonprofitsincluding churches. And theres the problem.
Forestville New Redeemer Baptist Church, for example, had its rain tax assessed at $744 a year by Prince Georges County, and the church just couldnt afford it. But we neednt worry. If, with the countys help, the church installs rain barrels, plants some trees, and replaces its parking lot tarmac with permeable material, the tax will be reduced to virtually nothing, according to the churchs pastor, Nathaniel Thomas.
Or maybe, in fact, we do need to worry, for the church also has to do for the county just a little bit morejust the little bit more that proves its heart is in the right place. The church must also run a green ministry, promoting the environmentalist changes to its property. And Pastor Thomas must preach, just now and again, environmentally focused sermons to educate his congregation.
Around 30 churches in the county have applied to join the rain-tax rebate program, which will save some of them (especially the ones with large parking lots) thousands of dollars a year. The Washington Post story was secularist in its framing, which is to say that the reporting was done in a kind of wonder that churches, of all things, are getting these rebate dealsthereby setting the county up for possible wall-of-separation and viewpoint-discrimination lawsuits from secular nonprofits and even for-profit businesses.
But precisely what religious Americans should worry about is that churches, of all things, are getting these deals. The nations houses of worship are an untapped resource for making people do what is right, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency told the Post. And when government officials start telling churches to preach what is right, weve crossed into a new and very un-American world of sermons for the kings pleasure.
A world, for that matter, of sermons for the kings money. By all reports, Adam Ortiz is a good guy. Environmental director for Prince Georges County, hes a tall, wide-eyed man with a lopsided smile and a goofy Van Dyke beard framing his mouth. He doesnt look like someone who wants to wreck the republic and establish the kind of well-controlled state churches for which even King GeorgeI of Great Britain hungered in vain. Ortiz simply believes in environmentalism so deeply that he doesnt understand the possibility that churches shouldnt be bribed to preach about what he thinks they must also believe is right. Protecting the Chesapeake from pollutants carried in by runoff is important, sure. Thats why Maryland imposed the rain tax. But more important is getting peoples minds straight. And who better than the churches for that?

After a long day on November 13, 2013, Speaker of the House John Boehner walked down the marble hallways of the Longworth House Office Building to the personal office of Representative Devin Nunes for a drink, a cigarette, and maybe a brief reprieve.A fighter gestures outside the burning U.S. mission in Benghazi, September 11, 2012NEWSCOMBut Boehners visit was not a social call. He was there to see three CIA officers who had fought in Benghazi, Libya. Their identities were unknown to all but a small group of U.S. government officials with high-level security clearances, and the details of their harrowing stories were unknown to virtually everyone who was not a colleague or relative.
And the fact that the meeting was taking place at all was unknown to the man who, under different circumstances, might have been expected to host it. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was not invited.

Rogers was sick of Benghazi. Some of his Republican colleagues had spun themselves into a frenzy of conspiracy theorizing, publicly making wild claims that had no basis in fact or hinting at dark conspiracies that had the president of the United States willfully and eagerly arming its enemies. Representative Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, long the Republican face of Benghazi investigations, accused Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of giving a stand-down order to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Representative Louie Gohmert claimed that Senator John McCain deserved some of the blame for Benghazi because McCain, like Barack Obama, had supported opposition forces in Libya. Normally responsible Republicans pretended that Hillary Clintons famous what difference at this point does it make line was not so much a tone-deaf question about how the attacks happened, which deserved the criticism it earned, but a declaration of indifference that the attacks happened, which was absurd. Rogers complained about these excesses regularly to his staff and colleagues.
This frustration, however, wasnt the reason Boehner and Nunes cut him out of the meeting with CIA officers. They shared his frustration, as it happened.
Their concern was deeper. Rogers had long been reluctant to commit more time and resources to investigating Benghazi. At a meeting of intelligence committee Republicans in early 2013, just four months after the attacks, Rogers laid out his priorities for the new Congress. Not only was Benghazi not on that list, according to three sources in the meeting, he declared to the members that the issue was in the past and that they wouldnt be devoting significant time and resources to investigating it. Whatever failures there had been in Benghazi, he explained, they had little to do with the intelligence community, and his intelligence committee would therefore have little to do with investigating them.
In the months that followed, more troubling details about the Benghazi story emerged in the media. Among the most damaging: Internal emails made clear that top Obama administration officials had misled the country about the administrations role in the flawed Benghazi talking points that Susan Rice had used in her Sunday television appearances following the attacks, and that former acting CIA director Michael Morell had misled Congress about the same. Other reports made clear that intelligence officials on the ground in Benghazi had reported almost immediately that the assault was a terrorist attack involving jihadists with links to al Qaedainformation that was removed from the materials used to prepare administration officials for their public discussion of the attacks. A top White House adviser wrote an email suggesting that the administration affix blame for the attacks on a YouTube video.
The revelations even roused the establishment media from their Benghazi torpor and generated extraordinarily hostile questioning of White House press secretary Jay Carney by reporters who had trusted his claims of administration noninvolvement.
None of this convinced Rogers to make Benghazi a prioritya fact that frustrated many of the committees members. Boehner received a steady stream of visits and phone calls from House members who complained that Rogers wasnt doing his job. In all, seven members of the intelligence committee took their concerns directly to the speaker or his top aides. Boehners presence at the secret meeting in Nuness office demonstrated that he shared those concerns long before he decided to impanel a select committee to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the Benghazi attacks. And what happened to the CIA officers as they attempted to share their story with congressional oversight committees suggests that those concerns were well founded.

The Weekly Standard,C,Here the Word   | The Weekly Standard,"
In William Makepeace ThackeraysVanity Fair (1848), Pitt Crawley, Becky Sharps first employer, an old, stumpy, short, vulgar, and very dirty man, in old clothes and shabby old gaiters, who smokes a horrid pipe, and cooks his own horrid supper in a saucepan, is given a characteristic by his creator that nicely rounds out his unusual character: The baronet has a taste not only for family prayers, but for sermons.Listening to the sermon in a Church of England church by T.H. JonesWe will resume yesterdays discourse, young ladies, he informs his female household, and you shall each read a page by turns; so that Miss aMiss Short may have an opportunity of hearing youat which the poor girls begin to spell out a long dismal sermon delivered at Bethesda Chapel, Liverpool, on behalf of the mission for the Chickasaw Indians. Was it not a charming evening?
By and large, with few exceptions, 20th-century historians tended to follow Thackeray in regarding sermons as little more than fodder for satire. Sir Robert Ensor might have conceded that, in the Victorian triumph of religion, the pulpit dominated, but he does not say how or why. Theodore Hoppen is no more illuminating, simply saying, Middle-class Victorians loved sermons, the longer the better. The otherwise fair-minded historian G.M. Young considered the mere hearing of sermons deleterious: After noting how a young man brought up in a careful home might have heard ... a thousand sermons, Young points out that the form of preachers was canvassed like the form of public entertainers, and the circulation of some Victorian sermons is a thing to fill a modern writer with despair.
Here was proof of the insatiable appetite of the public for sermons of all kinds. Still, for Young, 

If we consider the effect, beginning in childhood, of all the preachers on all the congregations, of men loud or unctuous, authoritative or persuasive, speaking out of a body of acknowledged truth to the respectful audience below them, we shall see why the homiletic cadence, more briefly Cant, is so persistent in Victorian oratory and literature. It sufficed to persuade the lower middle classes that Tupper was a poet and the upper middle classes that Emerson was a philosopher.

To say that a literary genre as supple and capacious as the sermon could only produce a taste for mountebanks like Martin Tupper and Ralph Waldo Emerson was typical of the 20th centurys unwillingness to meet the sermon on its own varied ground. In omitting to pay any attention to the sermons of the most influential homilists of the 19th century, Young was giving a misleading impression of the sermons of the Victorian age, as none of that eras best preachers, for all their doctrinal differences, went in for anything that could be justly characterized as cant. 
To appreciate afresh the wide-ranging field commanded by the sermon at a time when religion was still genuinely respected in the public sphere, even by agnostics and atheists, one needs only to recall the great preachers themselves: John Tulloch, the voice of liberal orthodoxy within the Church of Scotland; Henry Liddon, the heir of Pusey and learned Tractarianism; John Caird, the author of that most Victorian of sermons, Religion in Common Life, which he delivered before Queen Victoria at Balmoral in 1857. There was also Thomas Chalmers, first moderator of the Free Church; William Connor Magee, the great advocate for the benefits of the Church of Ireland, on an isle where Presbyterians and Roman Catholics were perpetually at each others throats; and Robert William Dale, the passionate evangelical whose sermons on St. Paul and the Trinity redefined what it meant to be evangelical long before Mark Noll began remonstrating with his co-religionists for neglecting the intellectual aspects of faith. 
Sermon writers were much more than mere pulpit entertainers: They could set the course for decades of theological inquiry. In the 18th century, Joseph Butlers pivotal sermon The Ignorance of Man (1719) prefigured a theology of devout skepticism to which generations of Anglicans would subscribe, from John Keble and Samuel Wilberforce to Dean Inge and Rowan Williams. Indeed, the great preachers made sermons bestsellers for serious readers right up to the end of the 19th century and beyond. It is high time that historians of religion paid such work the justice it deserves.

The last novel published in her lifetime, Death Comes to Pemberley (2011), was a departure for her, a splendid criminous sequel to Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice. She had done the unexpected before, with a true-crime book, The Maul and the Pear Tree: The Ratcliffe Highway Murders (1971), written with Thomas A. Critchley; with the creation of a female private eye in An Unsuitable Job for a Woman (1972); with her first bestseller, an unconventional mystery novel outside the Dalgliesh series, Innocent Blood (1980); with the minor science fiction classic The Children of Men (1992), depicting a near-future in which humans have stopped giving birth; and with Time to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography (1999). But most of her books featured Adam Dalgliesh, and, despite her advanced age, it is hard to believe that The Private Patient (2008), 14th in the series, would be the last of them. She told the BBC in 2013 that she was working on another detective story, so there is reason for hope.
Some pegged James as a mystery writer who transcended the genre. She did nothing of the kind. True, her novels grew longer and more richly detailed, her grappling with contemporary social issues increasingly ambitious. Yes, her characters were fully realized and never seemed like puppets in service of a puzzle. And theres no denying that she brought to her work all the seriousness and thematic attention of any good novelist. But she never deserted the classical detective novel pattern as handed down by her predecessors from the interwar Golden Age of Detection.
To risk another loaded term, she even had a formula: Create an established but often threatened business or institutiona forensics lab, a publishing company, a school for nurses, an atomic research station, a psychiatric clinic, a home for the disabled, a barristers chambers, a theological college, a museumand people it with a variety of characters; have a murder or two within the closed circle of possible suspects; reveal the solution with the explanation of clues clearly shared with the reader. Far from leaving genre behind, P.D. James demonstrated what high-quality work could be achieved within its strictures.
Her 2009 Talking About Detective Fiction makes a historical point that simultaneously celebrates the unique features of the detective story and questions the artificial barriers between genre and real literature. Jane Austen, by no definition a crime writer, anticipated the detective-story pattern decades before Edgar Allan Poes credited invention of the form. In Austens Emma, James writes,
The secret which is the mainspring of the action is the unrecognized relationship between the limited number of characters ... and Jane Austen deceives us with cleverly constructed clues (eight immediately come to mind)some based on action, some on apparently innocuous conversations, some in her authorial voice. At the end, when all becomes plain and the characters are at last united with their right partners, we wonder how we could have been so deceived.

Indeed, something similar occurs in Pride and Prejudice, in which Elizabeth Bennet reviews the ways in which she had misread Darcys character and how matters could have been interpreted differently.

Many Brits are known to enjoy a pint a day. Winston Churchill certainly didthough his daily ration was a pint of champagne, not ale. So it was fitting that the wartime prime minister was toasted last week in Washington with clinking glasses of bubbly. House speaker John Boehner invited a small groupof which The Scrapbook was happily partto celebrate two birthdays: that of the great man himself, and that of the bust in the Capitol that honors him. One was the 140th, the other just the first.NewscomFred Barnes chronicled in these pages a year ago how the bronze bust came to be. President Obama, redecorating when he moved into the White House in 2009, famously removed a bust of Churchill from the Oval Office and sent it to the British embassy. When Boehner became speaker in 2011, he passed a resolution that an appropriate statue or bust of Sir Winston Churchill be placed in the Capitol. The Churchill Centre at George Washington University donated the bust, sculpted by the late Oscar Nemon, last year. Since then, weve confronted more grave challenges to our peoples. Weve been fortunate torely on our special relationship and, of course, Churchills wisdom, Boehner said in the Freedom Foyer, the alcove where the bust sits, before raising his glass: So heres to Winston Churchill, the best friend America ever had.

The ambassador spoke eloquently of the two nations shared tradition of freedom that goes back to the Magna Carta (which celebrates its 800th birthday next year). The group then retired to the speakers rooms for a receptionwith more champagne, of course.

Towards midnight one night last week I walked miles down the pitch-black European shore of the Bosphorus, the 15-mile channel that splits Istanbul and Turkey in half. To any watcher of TV news, that will sound nuts. Fifteen million people have converged on Istanbul in recent decades, cramming into just-thrown-up tenements and dirty slums. The demographics are skewed towards the young, the unscrupulous, and the criminal. Turkish youths do not figure prominently among Americas biggest admirers. In November some of them were captured on film trying to pull plastic bags over the heads of sailors on shore leave from the destroyer USS Ross. Others are rushing to join the Muslim extremists of ISIS just across the border.Jori BoltonDoesnt scare me. The Bosphorus is among the loveliest places on earth, but this time of year it is among the safest, too. All kinds of fish migrate between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara in the falldelicious mackerel, tender bass, and the superbly fryable smelt-sized mullet called barbunya. Bundled up against the cold, spaced out every five or six feet along the entirety of the shoreline, all the men of Istanbul are standing with their casting rods and their tackle boxes and maybe a bucket with the evenings dinner swimming around in it. They crack jokes, drink hot tea out of thermoses, and snack on the cartwheel-shaped sesame bagels called simit.

Not that those who see Turkey as a menacing place are wrong. I used to write a lot about political Islam and the AK party of Recep Erdogan, the current president. That took me into the boondocks. At a low point in the Iraq war, a war that Turkey did not support nohow, an Istanbul friend suggested I get to know the real Turkey by visiting his grandmothers village. It was deep in the countryside, an hour or so outside of the ancient Silk Road city of Kayseri. The politically correct would call Kayseri a crossroads of civilizations. Another way to look at it would be as lying in the gap between civilizations, where mutually distrustful shysters cross paths on their way to rip other people off. Uncharitable visitors might call it a dump.
A car was to take me out of Kayseri in the morning, but when it arrived the driver (dark-haired, fiery-eyed, young) and the translator (gray, querulous) were arguing. I dont mean arguing about soccer. I mean arguing in a spittle-flying, finger-pointing, dashboard-pounding way that portended a fight.
We made it a few blocks. The driver jammed on the brakes. The translator screamed at him for 30 seconds before jumping from the car. This driver? he said to me. Asshole! He get for you other translator. He slammed the door and I never saw him again. The driver and I went to a local tourist information agency. My new translator got in the car. Good day, he said to me. He and the driver fell into an animated conversation in Turkish.
About 312 people lived in the village. The mayor had agreed to meet me. We sat in his officehim, me, and about two dozen of his top aides. Before I could begin thanking him for having me, he began to give me a lecture, his voice quivering and rising. I picked up half-words here and there.
ok yok ekmek Bush! Bushli Bushleri Rumsfeld-li! Iranli Irakli Saddamli! Evet? Beslar meslar peslar Erdogan-da, Project for a New American Century-da!
I looked to the translator for help.
Him have for to be for have, he said. Bouche.
Could you repeat that? I said.
After war is was time into the him there very after, he replied. Bouche.
When we were done, the translator tried to say something else. Either the mayor was inviting me to lunch or I was about to star in an Internet torture video. The mayor and his aides and I went to a cliffside park outside of town. They roasted me a lamb. It was wonderful.

Perhaps you too have been wondering why it is that President Obama is always, always telling us who we are as Americans and who we are not. Obviously, why he does this is a complicated question. And I guess always is an exaggeration. Frequently, thoughhe does it very frequently.Gary LockeTo pull one little item from the Google hopper: He was asked earlier this year about football players and the concussions they always (frequently) seem to be getting. There are few subjects the president wont comment on.
We have to change a culture that says you suck it up, the president said. At the same time, he went on, football will continue to be, even after we stop sucking it up, fundamental to who we are as Americans. Boola boola.
The little clump of words about who we are as Americans pops out of the presidents mouth so often its easy to miss it, even when he says it twice on the same occasion, a few sentences apart, as he sometimes does. Its not necessarily annoying. Often when he tells us who we are the phrase has a nice, friendly lilt to it, as though the president were giving us a pat on the back. You hear him at the 9/11 museum saying, Nothing can ever break us. Nothing can change who we are as Americans, and you think, Thanks, Obama!
Unfortunately, Americans might also get confused about who we are, assuming were paying attention to our president. Its easy to lose track.
Thats who the American people aredetermined, and not to be messed with, the president said again last summer. So, number one, were bad ass. This is probably related to our being football fundamentalists. But make no mistake: We have a gentler side. All the Christmas parties, Seders, and Muslim religious ceremonies the president hosts at the White House are an affirmation of who we are as Americans. So, number two, were religious, without overdoing it.

Values, he said on another occasion last year, make us who we are as Americans. He decided not to get too specific about which values make us, so we may conclude simply that, unlike other people, we are people with values. Thats number three. National monuments, he said a few years ago, tell the story of who we are as Americans. Number four: Were monumental. The Bowe Bergdahl affair, from last summer, does the same thingthat national monuments do. It shows that an ironclad commitment to bring our prisoners of war home is what makes us who we are as Americans.
We shape our destiny ... thats who we are. So, number five, we are destiny shapers who always go get our prisoners of war, even if we have to let loose a bunch of Taliban first.

Income inequality challenges the very essence of who we are as a people. We can all make lots of money, as Americans, but not too much.
Sometimes the president teams up with his wife, who uses the word clump when shes talking about her national exercise and diet programs. She has talked about the many cultures and faith traditions that make us who we are as Americans. When they set about to decorate the White House for Christmas, Mrs. Obama said last year, We tried to tell a story about who we are as Americans.
I could go on and on with many more examples, but youd hate me.
The phrase, youll notice, carries a vaguely therapeutic air. Our language everywhere shows the smudgy hand of the therapist, the life coach, the counselor, the facilitator. People nowadays say they reach out to people that they just used to talk to, and share things when they just used to say things, and talk of themselves, of their feelings and impressions and habits, without ceasing. It is the mission of the therapists and life coaches to enable you to find yourself, to discover who you really are as a person, to decant the authentic you. I suppose it was inevitable that the seductive language of therapy would migrate into the language of politics.

Foxcatcher is a slow, gripping, fact-based movie about a bizarre and lonely heir to the Du Pont fortune whose obsession with the sport of wrestling eventually led him to commit a pointless and vicious murder. What makes Foxcatcher compelling is that its story, its setting, and its characters are so odd, so singular, so unlike anything weve seen before.A weird, tragic, compelling tale tainted by politicsIn the first place, wrestling is a deeply weird activity; its homoerotic aspects are so inescapable that early scenes of the two Schultz brothers at the heart of the story, Dave (Mark Ruffalo) and Mark (Channing Tatum), training together seem basically incestuous. John du Pont (Steve Carell), who paid through the nose so he could host the sports Olympic training facility at his family estate in Pennsylvania, was a profoundly strange person whose mother had to pay her chauffeurs son to be his childhood friend. Du Pont encourages Mark, an emotionally isolated and inarticulate child-man living on scraps of money despite his two Olympic gold medals, to train at Foxcatcher Farms.
Mark comes to worship Du Pont. But for reasons that seem to have been left on the cutting-room floorpossibly something to do with the resentment of Du Ponts mother and some unfulfilled sexual urge on the older mans partDu Pont shuts Mark down and begins to cultivate the more sociable and worldly Dave. This is a torment to Mark and a financial godsend to Dave. Eventually, it seems to drive Du Pont into madness.

The three actors are exemplary. Carell, who has already demonstrated his chops playing a man of questionable character in last years The Way Way Back, is chilling in his depiction of the delusional Du Pont. Ruffalo offers a layered portrait of deep sweetness mixed with sibling-rival guile. And Tatum, the leading male box-office sensation of the past couple of years and an expert comic actor like the other two, is absolutely heartbreaking.
Everything is set here for a downbeat but fascinating Fargo-like journey, and for the most part, thats what you get. But Foxcatchers director, Bennett Miller, and screenwriters Dan Fogelman and E. Max Frye are convinced they have an Important Cautionary Tale About American Greed and Inequality on their hands, and they weigh Foxcatcher down with unnecessary sociological portent. The film begins with Mark making a witless and dull patriotic speech for $20 to a depressed group of schoolchildren, and it ends with someone fighting a bloody cage match in front of a crowd of yahoos chanting U-S-A.
Foxcatchers oddball set of facts cant bear the weight. I suppose it means something that the villain here carries the name of Du Pont, but Johns membership in a very large and wealthy American family tells us nothing about the bizarreries of his behavior. Clearly, the creative team here was tickled by the fact that Du Pont and Mark Schultz apparently shared anti-Communist politicsbut those have little to do with the conduct of a dilettante orni-thol-o-gist--cum--coke-head who was evidently thrilled by the sight of muscular young men slamming each other around a wrestling ring. And the film suggests it was corrupt of the Olympic wrestling establishment to allow Du Pont to sponsor the teamthat it just shows rich people can buy anything.
Thats a peculiar tack for this movie to take once you consider that Foxcatchers producer, Megan Ellison, is herself an heiress to the Oracle software billions that have made it possible for her to write checks in the tens of millions to bring movies like this one (and Zero Dark Thirty and The Master) to the screen in hopes of winning an Oscar, much as John du Pont hoped to be the motive cause of a gold medal.
The people Foxcatcher depicts, and the tale it tells, represent nothing but themselves. Miller and his writers should have left America out of it.

Executing, or allegedly misconstruing, a direct order to engage the enemy, the Light Brigade mounted an assault into a valley defended on three sides by Russian infantry, cavalry, and artillery.
Theirs, Tennyson wrote in his famous poem, not to reason why / Theirs but to do and die / Into the valley of Death / Rode the six hundred.
Much of the literature on the Light Brigade presents the top-brass view. Lord Raglan, commander of the British forces; the earl of Lucan, commander of the cavalry; and the earl of Cardigan, commander of the Light Brigade, are variously held responsible for the disastrous charge. Raglan, frustrated by the apparent inaction of the Light Brigade at Balaklava, sent a series of orders expressing his desire for action. Part of the problem, however, was the ambiguity with which Raglan expressed himself: He gave geographical directions from his point of view, for example, which did not make much sense in the field. 

No one seems to have asked any probing questions, howeverperhaps because communication was slow and prone to failure. At any rate, the brigade quickly took action: up the wrong valley and after the wrong Russians, from Raglans point of view. Within minutes, hundreds were either killed or injured.
Anthony Dawson is less interested in this long-running blame game than in giving us an insight into the experience of the relatively lower ranks. We are presented with hundreds of letters from privates, trumpeters, corporals, and sergeants. Dawson has admirably traced many previously unpublished or obscure accounts from a series of archives and 160-year-old newspapers. As the president of the British Commission for Military History, Major General Mungo Melvin (Ret.), notes in his foreword, the presentation of so many new perspectives is a valuable addition to Crimean War literature.
One of the delights of Dawsons volume is the directness with which many of the correspondents write. For example, Private Robert Chambers from the 11th Hussars takes us right into the horror of the valley, incidentally highlighting how wrong the charge felt from the outset:
We ... were ordered, though [it was] perfect madness, to advance. ... As soon as we neared the plain their terrific fire of artillery and musketry from the hills on each side opened on us, and a troop of guns ranged in front of us as we advanced. The plain was about two miles in length and two hundred yards wide, so you can form some idea how we were knocked over, and having no support from our own army of either infantry, cavalry or artillery, we charged immense masses of Russian cavalry and artillery and on our return up the plain to our main body, their cavalry had reformed across the plain to intercept our passage, which, however, we broke through, when their batteries and infantry from the hills opened on us, horses and men falling every stride.

And on he goes, telling his mother that he remains miraculously unhurt and winding up his letter by estimating friendly and enemy casualties. He ends with a typical Victorian flourish: May the Almighty, in His omnipotent understanding, terminate the cause in favour of the righteous.
Although the Crimean War is often discussed in terms of human sufferingthe thousands who died in action or from near-criminal medical neglect or from the Russian wintermany of the cavalrymen included here are proud and patriotic. The war was the first experience of action and foreign travel for many; a sense of excitement is palpable. It can be easy nowadays to think of wars as contentious, difficult, and protracted; then as now, however, many of those on the front line see things differently. Here, most correspondents write with an unfussy, self-reliant tone. They want to be involved, and to win.

The Weekly Standard,C,Kevorkians Vision | The Weekly Standard,"
Assisted suicide exploded into the news again two months ago after Brittany Maynard, dying of brain cancer, announced she would take a lethal prescription as permitted under Oregon law. Maynard became an international celebrity, lauded as courageous in a cover story in People and featured in the worlds top media outlets.Jack Kevorkian, 1997NEWSCOMThe last time the media swarmed so feverishly in favor of assisted suicide was when they touted Jack Kevorkians defiant assisted suicide campaign in the 1990s. As they later would with Maynard, the media substituted intense emotionalism for reporting and analysis, focusing almost exclusively on the suffering of those who wanted to die rather than the radical societal changes Kevorkian hoped his death campaign would bring about.
Kevorkian is dead, but the policies he advocated are becoming realityone bit here, another bit therethroughout much of the West. For example, Kevorkian insisted that access to assisted suicide should not be restricted to the terminally ill. He put his poison where his mouth was, too: About 70 percent of those who flew to Michigan to end their lives with Kevorkians assistance werent terminally ill. Five werent even sick, according to their autopsies, including his second known assisted suicideMarjorie Wantza mentally ill woman who complained of chronic pain.
As advocated by Kevorkian, euthanasia or assisted suicide laws and pending legislative proposals outside of the United States do not limit doctor-facilitated death to the terminally ill. Euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Quebec, none of which limit it to terminal illness. Ditto Switzerland, where suicide clinics dispatch the dying and non-dying alike. The same goes for Scotlands pending legislation to legalize assisted suicide.

It is true that the three states that have formally legalized assisted suicideOregon, Washington, and Vermontrestrict it to the terminally ill. But that seems more a political expedient than a principled approach. Indeed, there have been several legalization proposals here that would have been far more expansive. For example, New Hampshires 2014 bill, HB 1325, claimed to limit legalized assisted suicide to the dying, but used Jonathan Gruber-type obfuscation to hide its true intent in the definition of terminal illness:
Terminal condition means an incurable and irreversible condition, for the end stage for which there is no known treatment which will alter its course to death, and which, in the opinion of the attending physician and consulting physician competent in that disease category, will result in premature death. [emphasis added]

That definition is broad enough to drive a hearse through, potentially encompassing conditions such as progressive multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons disease, diabetes, and asymptomatic HIV infection. Indeed, as the disability rights activist Stephen Drake of Not Dead Yet wrote blasting the bill, My [disabled] partner would fit that definition. Many people I work with also fit the definition. None of them are dying.
Kevorkian also believed that assisted suicide was a human right that should be allowed to anyone wanting to die. Thus, in his 1991 book, Prescription Medicide: The Goodness of a Planned Death, Kevorkian wrote in favor of what he called optional assisted suicide:
This is for individuals, sometimes in good physical and mental health, who choose to be killed. ... The compelling factors may be physical (the end stage of incurable disease, crippling deformity, or severe trauma), mental (intense anxiety or psychic torture inflicted by self or others) or doxastic (religious or philosophical tenets or inflexible personal convictions).

Optional assisted suicides and euthanasia killings take place legally now. In the Netherlands, psychiatrists euthanize about 50 mentally ill patients a year, and doctors euthanize their elderly patients because they are tired of life. The KNMGthe Dutch Medical Associationwrote an ethics opinion arguing that suffering justifying euthanasia in the elderly could include money woes and loneliness.
In Belgium, a transsexual was euthanized legally because he was distraught by a botched sex change surgery. A psychiatric patient, taken advantage of sexually by her psychiatrist, was euthanized by his replacement because she was so distressed over the victimization. Elderly couples who dont want to be widowed have received joint euthanasia killingsto public applause.

The Weekly Standard,C,On a Roll  | The Weekly Standard,"
Republicans have lost the last two presidential elections, but not much else over thepast six years. Theyve capturedthe House and Senate. They now hold 31 governorships and 69 of the 99 state legislative chambers. What this means is pretty simple: Theres an emerging Republican majority.The GOP still has significant emerging to do before reaching majority status. It may never get there. The rise this year may be Republicans peak for now. They may have achieved nothing more than what University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato calls the emerging outline of possible GOP victory in 2016.
At the very least, a Republican must win the White House in 2016 while maintaining control of Congress. Republicans need to attract more votes from minorities, particularly Hispanics. They must continue to improve their appeal to women. Most of all, Republicans must avoid self-inflicted wounds such as prompting another government shutdown or nominating a poor presidential candidate.
Thats a lot to pull off. But Republicans have advantages they lacked in the presidential years of 2008 and 2012. One is the eight-year itch. Thats the tendency of voters to change parties in the White House after a two-term presidency. The only exception in the last seven instances of such a presidency was the election of George H.W. Bush in 1988 after Reagans two terms.
And President Obama is likely to make things worse for the Democratic candidate in 2016. He is not only unpopular but also appears committed to an unpopular agenda. Every poll shows Americans want compromise in Washington. Obamas preference is for confrontation.

He Never Learns El GanadorPresident Obamas Response?A Rejection of Liberal Democratic Governance The Real Party of the Rich   
 


Then theres the ideological direction of the Democratic party. Its tilting left.  All the energy and passion is on the left. The party is being McGovernized. Moderates have about as much influence as liberals do in the Republican party. The Democratic agendabigger government, higher taxes, increased spending, and cultural nihilismisnt a winning combination for 2016.
Midterm elections are not predictive of presidential outcomes. We know that from recent history: After winning in a landslide in the 2010 midterm, Republicans lost the presidential race two years later. Still, the 2014 election offers some clues about political trends. For instance, it suggests the Obama coalition is not the same as the Democratic coalition.
Obama was a great presidential candidate. He maximized the Democratic vote. But when he wasnt on the ballot in 2010 and 2014, Democrats lost badly. Their turnout machine didnt work as effectively without him on the ticket. So the Democratic coalition will probably be less broad in 2016.
Democrats think they have a number of current issues on their side. But issues that poll well dont always cause voters to back candidates of the party associated with those issues. Raising the minimum wage is a good example. Its clearly a Democratic issue. In November, voters in Arkansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Alaska backed increases in the minimum wage. At the same time, they elected Republicans to the Senateand by large margins except in Alaska.
Among the major Democratic issues today are global warming, same-sex marriage, abortion, and voter ID. Global warming is so far down the list of issues that voters care about, it has dropped out of sight. The fight over gay marriage is over. Democrats benefited in two election cycles from blaming Republicans for a war on women involving abortion and contraception. That issue died in 2014. Opposing voter ID laws may galvanize African Americans and the party base, but thats it. Besides, theres no evidence such laws prevent voting.
Immigration is different. It divides the country. Its a problem for Republicans, who need 40 percent or more of Hispanic voters to win the presidency. It is one of the few issues that actually may help Democrats. Even so, Republicans fared better with Hispanic voters in 2014 than in 2012. In Texas, Republican Greg Abbott got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in winning the governors race.
The Hispanic vote is growing, but its voters over 65 who are increasing the fastest as a share of the electorate. According to one estimate, seniors will be 30 percent of voters in 2030, Hispanics only 15 percent. And older voters tend to be more conservative, thus inclined to vote for Republicans.
The youngest voters, 18 to 29, are beginning to slip away from Democrats, too. Exit polls showed House Democrats had half the advantage with voters under 30 this year than they did in 2006. The partys grip on the young may be loosening, wrote Mark Bauerlein in the New York Times.

The Weekly Standard,C,Stormin Norman   | The Weekly Standard,"
Norman Mailer entered Harvard in the fall of 1939, just as World WarII began. His famous novel about part of that war, The Naked and the Dead, was published in 1948, and at age 25, like Lord Byron, he awoke to find himself famous. Sixty years later, looking back on the books immense successit topped the New York Times Book Reviews bestseller list for 11 consecutive weeks and remained on that list for 62 morehe commented on the experience of sudden fame: I knew Id be a celebrity when I came back to America [he and his wife were living in Paris] and I felt very funny towards it, totally unprepared. ... Ive always seen myself as an observer. And now I knew, realized, that I was going to be an actor on the American stage, so to speak. The writer as celebrity, and vice versaFrom that time until his death in 2007, Mailers career both as observer and actormanifested in the 40 or so books he would writegave us, in the words of Warner Berthoff, a uniquely substantial record of what it had meant to be alive in that long era.
Although Mailer has been capably biographed before and was the subject of a large oral history by Peter Manso, J. Michael Lennons 960-page account of him wont be improved upon. Not satisfied with producing this herculean biography, Lennon has followed it with a comparably thick selection of Mailers letters. Lennon knew Mailer for decades, talked extensively with him, and recorded what he heard. Unlike many biographers, Lennon feels the need to say something in judgment, however brief, of every one of Mailers books. To do this, while keeping the life narrative moving along, is a feat he performs with care and without pomposity. 

Lennon is especially attentive to Mailers undergraduate life, where he compiled a lopsided academic record, with a major in engineering sciences and six courses in creative writing. As a sophomore, he read D.H. Lawrences Lady Chatterleys Lover and what works of Henry Miller he could lay his hands on; both Lawrence and Miller would be central figures for the writer Mailer became. He wrote stories, published a novella (A Calculus at Heaven), and wrote a long unpublished one, A Transit to Narcissus, about a lunatic asylum in Mattapan, where he briefly worked. In an often-quoted anecdote, we find him, a few days after Pearl Harbor, debating with himself whether the war novel he was to write would be best set in Europe or the Pacific. Deciding that he didnt know enough European history, he chose a scene that few knew much about: the Philippine terrain of The Naked and the Dead.
Some of Lennons most fascinating pages are about Mailers service as an infantryman in the war and, after the wars end, as a cook in Japan. Lennon points out how the urban Mailer, child of Brooklyn and Harvard, nevertheless wrote, in more than one of his books, landscape descriptions that crackle and pulse with energy, ranking with the best of postwar American writers. Diana Trilling, one of Mailers earliest supportive critics, noted that the most dramatic moments in The Naked and the Dead are precipitated by intensities in nature.
Such intensities, however, were absent from the two novels that followed his bestseller. In the mid-1950s, Mailer, stung by the failure of his second novel, Barbary Shore (1951), and the mixed reception of his third, The Deer Park (1955), dreamed up the first of his impossible projects, that of writing eight interlocking novels that would explore topics such as pleasure, crime, communism, and homosexuality, ending with mysticism. The sequence would emanate from the mind of a character, Sam Slovoda, the protagonist of Mailers lively story The Man Who Studied Yoga.
What eventually ensued was not a novel at all but the first and best of Mailers miscellaneous books of nonfiction, Advertisements for Myself (1959), a work that more or less coincided with his stabbing of his second wife, Adele Morales. In her own book about the event, Morales testifies that Mailer said to her, as she was being wheeled into the operating room, I love you and I had to save you from cancerwhich is perhaps enough, and too much, to prove the madness that he succumbed to. His public explanation, scarcely a better one, was that a decades anger was responsible.

Wikimedia CommonsSend to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter While you were thinking about cooking turkey and how to survive your weird uncle, the White House was sliding information out into the public without you noticing.They seem to have made it a tradition of dropping regulatory agendas into the public at the end of the week, right before holidays. This year was no different. On the Friday before Thanksgiving, the White House quietly released its plan for new regulations in 2015. As Common Core battles continue in multiple states, the Department of Educations regulations prepare to gain ever more control over our kids education. Will Estrada, Director of Federal Relations for the Home School Legal Defense Association, says theyre concerned about three areas in particular:1. Public School Education of Children with Special Needs: One regulation still being drafted proposes to phase out the authority of states in defining academic standards for special education. Though it only specifies special education right now, theres no doubt this could expand to controlling all education.2. The Training for Public School Teachers: The Department is still trying to regulate teachers certifications and training from D.C., despite blocked attempts in 1994 and 2001.3. No Child Left Behind Waivers: Lastly, the government plans to continue using waivers for No Child Left Behind to forcibly convince states to adopt Common Core.The battle lines have been drawn, Estrada said. States, local school districts, and parents have the constitutional authority over their childrens education  and it needs to stay that way.


These reports show what we already know. The federal government is preparing to encroach even further on the citizens lives, deciding whats appropriate to teach the next generation of American citizens.This isnt the way our Founders envisioned it.When they created this nation, they established a government that would act in specific ways: to protect life, liberty, and property. Over the years, however, things have changed. The federal government  like a cancer  has spread and encroached into every area of life. That means that this information dump, if anyone had noticed it, would cause people to endlessly debate the merits of No Child Left Behind, teachers certificates, and special education standards.What is missing  what is almost always missing  is the question that gets to the heart of the matter. We need to stop endlessly debating the healthcare, economic, and educational policies that are handed down from on high. Decisions are best made as close to the home as possible, not in D.C. by a faraway bureaucrat who doesnt live with the consequences of his choice.Who decides?According to the Constitution, we do. In other words, citizens should make crucial decisions that so affect our children.Were tired of being over-regulated and tired of the federal governments machinery that creates more and more rules to keep itself going. (The Affordable Care Act passed four and a half years ago, and were still seeing regulations rolled out to enforce it.) Every law passed, every decision made, and every executive action taken needs still more regulation to make sense of it. Come to think of it, most government agencies that require these regulations to stay alive are themselves infringements on our liberties. Its time for us to stand up and say no to a government that seeks to control everything from what vehicles we drive to who our doctor is to what our child learns in school.The government has gotten good at creating more regulations and dumping them into the news when no one else is paying attention.Prepare yourself for whatever theyll announce right before Christmas.Tis the season!

The American Spectator,C,Ferguson in Black and White | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter The debate about the shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson got heated on NBCs Meet the Press on November 23 in an exchange between former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Michael Eric Dyson, an African-American academic, Princeton Ph.D. in religion, political analyst for MSNBC, and a professor of sociology at Georgetown University.Were talking about the exception here, contended Giuliani, regarding the shooting in Ferguson.The real issue is the fact that 93 percent of (murdered) blacks in America are killed by other blacks, Giuliani asserted. I would like to see the attention paid to that, that you are paying to this.About the complaint of heavy police presence in black communities, Giuliani said white police officers wouldnt be there if you werent killing each other 70 to 75 percent of the time.Dyson, responding, said this is a defense mechanism of white supremacy at work in your mind, sir.Replying to Giulianis proposal that the focus on violence and race in America should pivot toward reducing crime in the black community (What about the poor black child that is killed by another black child? asked Giuliani. Why arent you protesting that?), Dyson said Giulianis remarks reinforce a problematic perspective.


Whether the former mayors perspective is problematic is debatable, but Giuliani, former United States Associate Attorney General and former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, had his numbers right.The 93 percent of black homicide victims being killed by other blacks comes straight from the federal governments official crime statistics.Black Victims of Violent Crime, a 2007 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics by Dr. Erika Harrell, BJS statistician, states that about 93 percent of black homicide victims in single victim and single offender homicides were murdered by someone of their race.Blacks were the victims of an estimated 8,000 homicides in 2005, reported Harrell. While blacks accounted for 13 percent of the U.S. population in 2005, they were the victims in nearly half of all homicides.Among black males, the rate of crime is even more disproportionate than among blacks overall. Black males, approximately 6.5 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 52 percent (or 6,800) of the nearly 13,000 male homicide victims in 2005, reported Harrell. Black victims of homicide were most likely to be male  85 percent.Applying the 93 percent figure to black male homicide victims who are murdered by other blacks, that translates to 6,324 of the 6,800 murdered black males s in 2005 being killed by other blacks, primarily by black males.That averages out to between 17 and 18 black males killed per day by other blacks, disproportionately by young black males.In contrast, regarding white police officers killing blacks, USA Today reported on August 14 that Nearly two times a week in the United States, a white police officer killed a black person during the seven-year period ending in 2012, based on FBI calculations. On average, there were 96 such incidents among at least 400 police killings each year that were reported to the FBI by local police.Thats 96 blacks per year killed by police, on average, or less than 2 percent of the aforementioned 6,324 black maleskilled in one year, 2005, by other blacks.Thousands of blacks were being killed every year in New York City when he came into office as mayor in 1994, Giuliani said on the day after his Meet the Press appearance. That number, he said, dropped to about 200 per year by the time he left office eight years later.I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York than any mayor in the history of this city, said Giuliani. Id like to see if Dr. Dyson has ever saved as many lives in his community as Ive saved. Share this ArticlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitterLike this Article"

Send to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter The Rt. Honorable R.G. Withers, Privy Councillor to the Queen, who has died in Perth, was the major figure in bringing down the Whitlam Labor Government in 1975 and saving Australia from the Whitlams 21 Bills which, if passed, would have destroyed the Australian Constitution and created a statist dictatorship.Despite his cynical and larrikin image (he was nick-named The Toe-cutter) Withers, who during the war had served at sea as a naval coder, was a deeply learned man with a profound knowledge of history.This helped him see the menace to democracy of Labors bills and made him an advocate of impressive power. He went on to become Minister for Administrative Services but his achievement in putting backbone into the opposition to Gough Whitlams shambolic socialist government was probably his finest hour.The voluminous tributes from a leftist media to Whitlam, who died a few days previously, completely failed to mention these bills, which Withers in 1975 roused the Opposition in the Senate to block.He rallied the wavering among the Opposition Senators to stand firm to withhold granting money to the Government until the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, dismissed Whitlam and called an election.It is not surprising that Labors media poodles have sought to bury the memory of these bills and a penumbra of associated scandals under a mountain of gushing tributes to Whitlam.They were a vital part of the Labor Partys social engineering project that would have wrecked Australias Constitution and federal system, and given virtually unlimited power to Whitlams centralist government.Among other things the bill provided for prison terms for anyone insulting government employees. This, however, was only the start of it. They added up to the most extreme, dangerous, and thoroughly disgraceful attempt at social control and engineering since Australia became an independent country.Other parts of the 21 bills were to forward the Labor Project which, as Whitlam pointed out in his Chifley Lecture, meant:


 The creation of an Inter-State Transport Commission with powers beyond that of any Parliament, especially economic powers to dragoon the States, local government and the private sector. Using the External Affairs power to extend the powers of the federal government to greater control over employers, health service providers, and almost anything else that could be called an external matter because it was the subject of some obscure foreign treaty. The acquisition or establishment of industries by the central government, including newspapers. Establishing an international government shipping line (which could be expected to dovetail nicely with the ambitions of the communist-controlled seamens and waterfront unions). Regional administrative centers to bypass State Governments and render them pointless (as Hitler established Gaus to bypass the old German States). Socialization of the waterfront (see above); Powers over hospitals, universities and housing being taken from the States and assumed by central government. Greater intrusion by central government into the legal and administrative aspects of human relations. Increased central powers over marketing and investment.The 21 bills also specifically included: The Australia Police Bill, expanding on the existing powers of the Commonwealth Police and described by one academic as the most powerful agency of social control since Australia itself was a prison. The Superior Courts Bill, described by the Attorney-General as a great trials court, intended to bypass Australias common law traditions and enforce social engineering legislation. Two National Investment Fund Bills to drain resources into Government investment fund schemes.Whitlams socialism was far more ideological and totalitarian than that of the last Labor Prime Minister before him, the pragmatic and sensible Ben Chifley. Even without these bills Whitlam did the Australia economy enormous damage in his three years of misrule (with inflation, for example, going from 2% to nearly 20%).Whitlam himself said, and he meant it, that: My style is revolutionary, my substance is the most revolutionary [the Labor Party] have ever had. Like President Barack Obama, to whom he had in some ways an uncanny resemblance, he seemed to take a perverse delight in attacking and damaging the U.S. alliance, and cozying up to left-wing dictatorships (Australia was one of the first countries in the world to recognize the Pol Pot regime). A disciple of the proto-totalitarian Rousseau, he was given at times to Leninist phrases like the logic of history.The whole idea came to be feared and hated by the Australian people, who threw Labor out by landslides in 1975 and 1977. By the time Labor was re-elected under R. J. Hawke, it again had a pragmatic leader who had learnt sense.R.G. Withers will not get the extravagant tributes accorded Whitlam, but Australia, and perhaps more than Australia, owe him an immeasurably greater debt.

The American Spectator,C,The Cautionary Tale of Elizabeth Lauten | The American Spectator,"Print Article      
        
WH.govSend to Kindlediggemailfacebookredditstumbleupontwitter Elizabeth Lauten did something dopey. Say again, dopey. Criticizing President Obamas children  daughters sixteen and thirteen  was dopey. Presidential children, particularly minor children, are generally considered to be off limits. Ms. Lauten, the communications director for Tennessee Congressman Stephen Lee Fincher, took a social media poke at the two and is today jobless as a result.
There is a lesson in this for young conservatives. This is how the Left operates.What Lauten did, as mentioned, was dopey. Silly. But a front-page piece in the Washington Post? Breathless firestorm coverage from ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, USA Today, Politico, the Huffington Post, and on and on through the roster? Well, no. Did she have to resign her job? Of course not. Suspended or disciplined in some fashion? Yes. But allow the firestorm to consume her career? No.
Yet those two things have come to pass. So what is the lesson for young conservatives?
The lesson is that the true colors of the American Left never change. There is no reason  none  to humiliate a young woman at the very beginning of her career for a silly mistake like this. None. Yet there she is being savaged from coast to coast. And rest assured this would not happen were she a liberal staffer for a Democrat.
Case in point? The saga of Donny Lee Williams, Jr., which others have pointed out in comparison. Mr. Williams, 37, did make the Washington Post and a few other sites, the Post identifying him as having served as a staff director for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee. What did he do? Mr. Williams pleaded guilty to third-degree sexual abuse, two misdemeanor counts of sexual abuse and one count of misdemeanor threats. In other words, big trouble. But not so curiously he was not obsessed about throughout the liberal media as was Ms. Lauten.
What Elizabeth Lauten has just experienced up close and personal is the hard, cold fact of how the Left deals with conservatives in the media. Small mistakes are magnified out of all proportion. If you have made a mistake they will bait you and blow whatever it is you said or did into some cause clbre manufactured to make you look like an a) idiot, b) racist, c) homophobe, d) sexist or e) a mean intolerant rube.
A couple years back this was the game with Rush Limbaugh in the Sandra Fluke episode. The Left didnt want an apology  which Fluke got. They wanted Rushs head. His job, his career, everything. They actively went out of their way to try to sabotage him in a calculated campaign to intimidate his sponsors. The Get Rush effort, by the way, was in the works for years, with its creator  now at Media Matters  literally sitting out there just waiting for one unguarded moment to take him down. Likewise this was the game with Alaskas Governor Sarah Palin. Governor Palin, an accomplished self-made woman who had a serious record as a public official, was made to look the fool, demeaned and mocked in a fashion that these people would never allow were the woman in question Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren. The objective first, last, and always is not to disagree but to destroy. The other day Elizabeth Lauten was a young House staffer, today shes out of a job. Mission accomplished.



Early last year conservative commentator S.E. Cupp took a shot at Rush, as I noted here at the time. The essence of her complaint as she was quoted in a New York Times magazine article was that young conservatives
cant be afraid to call out Rush Limbaugh. If we can get three Republicans on three different networks saying, What Rush Limbaugh said is crazy and stupid and dangerous, maybe thatll give other Republicans cover to denounce the talk-show host as well.

The backlash she received from Rushs fans was apparently enough to cause her to write a column in the New York Daily News headlined:
I won't be Rushed: For the sake of conservatism, Limbaughs defenders need to get his fallibility through their heads

Cupp went on to address her fellow conservatives by saying, in part, this;
For one, part of the point I was trying to make was that the impulse to defend anything and everything that a party heavyweight says  to the death  has the deleterious effect of making conservatives seem irrational and herd-like. No one is right all the time, and no one is above reproach

Well, of course no one is right all the time. But what Ms. Cupp missed in her response is exactly what is on display with the response to Elizabeth Lauten. As noted above, I said Ms. Lauten made a mistake. But what the American Left is about is what was once called back in the days of the Reagan administration the politics of personal destruction. Lautens critics were not interested in hearing an apology. They were interested in destroying her. So savaging her that she could never again work on Capitol Hill or wherever else she wants to establish her career.
I have no idea what Elizabeth Lauten thinks of Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin or anyone else on the conservative side of the political line. I dont know her. But this episode should serve as a red flag to young conservatives that you dont have to be as famous or as powerful as Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin are perceived to be by some to be targeted for destruction. You can be just a normal, anonymous Capitol Hill aide or anybody else on the right. One simple misstep and you are toast. The other side will make it their business to bring you down.
Back there in 1955, when a young William F. Buckley Jr. was busy creating National Review, he publisheda now-famous Mission Statement for the magazine, found here. Among other things he said this:
Conservatives in this country  at least those who have not made their peace with the New Deal, and there is serious question whether there are others  are non-licensed nonconformists; and this is dangerous business in a Liberal world, as every editor of this magazine can readily show by pointing to his scars. Radical conservatives in this country have an interesting time of it, for when they are not being suppressed or mutilated by the Liberals, they are being ignored or humiliated by a great many of those of the well-fed Right, whose ignorance and amorality have never been exaggerated for the same reason that one cannot exaggerate infinity.

For better or worse, every conservative in the spotlight is just as Buckley said: a non-licensed nonconformist; and this is dangerous business in a Liberal world Elizabeth Lauten has just found out exactly what this means.
Which leads to one last point.
Memo to Congressman Fincher: Your communications director made a mistake. As someone who began his Washington career as a press secretary to a congressman, I can say with experience it was a silly mistake. A learning mistake. She got in trouble for it. But lesson learned. It is not the kind of mistake that should cost a young woman of good heart her job. Most particularly it is important to make the point that conservatives should stand up for their own when they get in trouble. Because what goes on out there is a highly calculated effort by the Left not to disagree with conservatives but to destroy conservatives. To, when at all possible, wreck their lives, ruin their careers, and drive them from the public square.
One doesnt have to defend the mistake, but one needs to understand whats really going on when these things happen. And in the case at hand, it is not just a mistake to not re-hire Elizabeth Lauten, it is wrong.

Mother Jones,L,How Science Can Tell If Your Great-Grandparents Were Strikebreakers | Mother Jones,"Christine Kenneally on the connections between your genes and your history.By Indre Viskontas | Fri Dec. 5, 2014 6:30 AM ESTTweetEmail
An 1832 engraving of Newcastle William Miller/Wikimedia Commons

Geneticist Stephen Leslie kept coming back to a handful of data points that seemed out of place on his genetic map of Britain. ""It was driving me absolutely insane,"" he's quoted as saying in Christine Kenneally's new book, The Invisible History of the Human Race. No matter how many times he re-ran the analysis, double-checking the data and his code, the anomaly wouldn't budge. So he figured that if his finding was true, there must be some logical explanation.
Some of the most important discoveries in science and technology have grown out of persistent and puzzling observations. Like when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the first evidence of the Big Bang while mapping radio signals from the Milky Way. At first they thought it was interference from urban Manhattan, or maybe from pigeon poop. But eventually they realized that the annoying noise was in fact the signal that the beginning of the universe left behind: cosmic background radiation. And so they won the Nobel Prize. Or when Pfizer developed a little blue pill to treat chest pain, whose surprising side effect is responsible for much of the spam in your inbox.
In Leslie's case, the anomaly was the finding that an individual living near the English city of Newcastle had eight great-grandparents who were all from the faraway county of Devon. On a recent episode of the Inquiring Minds podcast, Kenneally explained why this was so strangeand what it might tell us about the history of England.

When scientists are trying to figure out the genetic basis of a disease, they need to know what else differentiates people who have the illness from those who don't. That way, they can tell which DNA variations might be related to the disease and which ones are entirely irrelevant to that disease. So if a particular genetic signature is associated with a specific population, that information can be help researchers rule out aspects of genetic variation that have nothing to do with the illness in question. Characterizing this regional genetic map is one of the main goals of Leslie's work.
Kenneally's book tracks the ways in which this sort of data can also be used to illuminate history, and she describes the methods that Leslie and his colleagues used to map out genetic variation in large populations. Specifically, the scientists collected and analyzed blood samples from a population of about 4,500 people living in rural Britain. To be a part of the study, participants had to have four grandparents who who were all born near each other. These blood samples were then entered into a genome-wide association analysis. That means that instead of looking for a handful of ""candidate genes""the way many genetic studies had done in the past, with little successthe scientists employed a new method that allowed them to simultaneously compare tens of thousands of sites on the genomes of thousands of people. Using this analysis, they were then able to identify parts of the genome that characterize people from specific places.
To learn more about this ""People of the British Isles"" study, you can watch this short video:

The research produced some remarkable results, revealing that groups of people from specific parts of Britain had unique genetic markers. ""They isolated at least 20 different groups,"" explains Kenneally. ""And one of the first things that this tells us is that people lived in those areas for a very, very long timeway back to 1,000 or 2,000 years ago. The local villagers were marrying each other; their children grew up, they married the girl next door, the boy next door."" This fact was borne out by the rest of Leslie's dataset: Most people in the study shared similar DNA with their closest neighbors.
It's important to understand that the regional differences identified in the study were minor. ""All these people [the entire sample, that is] are almost entirely, exactly genetically the same, and these differences are extremely subtle, and they probably have no impact whatsoever on people's health or traits or anything like that,"" says Kenneally. ""But they're these tastes or flavors in the genome that tell us a little bit about the past.""
So what was it that drove Leslie nuts as he stared at his data?
""Once they had sorted Great Britain out into all these neat little groups, there was someone in Newcastle who looked like they shouldn't be there,"" says Kenneally. This person was born near Newcastle and had four grandparents who were also born in the area. But the individual in question had DNA that looked a lot like the the patterns found in people who were from Devon, 400 miles to the south. Indeed, the genetic data seemed to suggest that back in the 1800s, all eight of this person's great-grandparents had migrated to the region from the same part of Devon. For some reason, these people had all intermarried, and their descendants had tooinstead of marrying the locals, as would be expected.
""Once they had sorted Great Britain out into all these neat little groups, there was someone in Newcastle who looked like they shouldn't be there.""
""This just seemed really implausible,"" explains Kenneally. There wasn't an obvious cultural reason why the ancestors of the migrants from Devon would remain so isolated, with even the next generation intermarrying rather than mixing with the locals. After all, they weren't ethnically or religiously distinct from most other residents of Newcastle. ""If they were a religious groupif they were Catholics, or if they were Jewish peopleit might perhaps make sense thatthey would have continued to marry within their group."" But there was nothing special about those Devonians. ""No offense to Devonians; it's just that there was nothing binding them together,"" adds Kenneally. ""So, Leslie ran and re-ran his analysis over and over again. It was absolutely driving him mad.""
When science failed to provide the solution to the puzzle, Leslie turned to the ultimate source of information: the internet. Searching genealogical websites, he found an important historic connection between Devon and Newcastle: In the 1800s, both places relied heavily on the mining industry. In 1830, Newcastle's miners formed a union, and the following year, they went on strike. The Great Strike of 1831 was a massive victory for the miners. But a year later, the owners of the mine brought in workers from other parts of Britain, including Devon, and starved the locals into submission. The union soon collapsed, and the mine owners began to systematically lower wages. Other strikes would follow in the years to come. The situation left the locals angry and bitterand much of that anger was no doubt directed at the out-of-town miners and their families.

""These people were strikebreakers,"" says Kenneally. ""So they would've been really isolated from their new communities. People would not have wanted to talk with them, let alone to marry them and have children with them."" And that's one likely solution to Leslie's genetic mystery: The eight transplants from Devonalong with their descendantsmay have been ostracized by the locals.
Leslie's analysis demonstrates just how powerful genetic data can be. ""In these tiny gaps where we're different, where you have a few markers here and there, or maybe a few hundred or thousand markers here and there,"" says Kenneally, ""those markers can tell us something about not just our health, not just our individual traits, but the history of the human race as well.""

Mother Jones,L,Watch the Bullies Who Protest Outside of Abortion Clinics Get Exactly What They Deserve | Mother Jones,"By Inae Oh| Fri Dec. 5, 2014 4:53 PM ESTTweetEmail
A video of a pregnant woman delivering a scathing rebuke toa group of anti-abortion protestorsoutsidea London abortion clinic is going viral on social media.
A group of protestors from the British pro-life organization Abort67gathered in front of the clinic to film women as they entered. In the video, the protestors can be seen denying that they're filming the women,despite the fact that, curiously enough, they were outfitted with cameras on their chests while standing in front of a bloody fetus banner. With their weak denials quickly dissolving, one of the protestors then owns upbut explains that the group regularly records their demonstrations to prevent ""false accusations we're harassing people."" That's when the woman courageously goes off on the protestors:
""It's wrong what you're doing. You don't know why people are doing what they're doing, but you want to be out here judging and filming...Youre standing out here making people feel guilty. I think this is wrong on so many levels. Many people have been abused, you don't know what their reasons are for.""
The woman, who has been identified as an employee of a charity group that assists children in need, then suggests the protestors quit trying to guilt other women and instead help out real vulnerable kids.
Bravo.

Mother Jones,L,Friday Cat Blogging - 5 December 2014 | Mother Jones,"By Kevin Drum| Fri Dec. 5, 2014 2:45 PM ESTTweetEmailIn today's episode of Friday catblogging, Hilbert is trying to prove that he's a size 12. He was unconvincing, despite plenty of squirming to try to fit his entire body into the shoe box. The result was an interestingly blurred face, but not an entire cat in the box.
In other news, we've had to clear off the mantle over the fireplace because it turns out that Hopper can shinny up the bricks and start whacking away at whatever is up there. But there's more to the story. We figured that Hilbert was a bit too gravity-bound to pose any similar danger, so we were blaming Hopper whenever something got knocked over. But on Wednesday night, during the 9 pm play hour, we watched in awe as Hilbert careened across the living room floor, flung himself straight up the brick facing, and grabbed onto the mantle. He barely made it, and had to chin himself up the last few inches, but make it he did. Nothing is safe around here anymore.

Mother Jones,L,Don't Let the Rolling Stone Controversy Distract You From the Campus Rape Epidemic | Mother Jones,"1 in 5 women is sexually assaulted in college.

Mother Jones,L,Elizabeth Warren Doesn't Like This Treasury Nominee. Here's Why. | Mother Jones,"Would investment banker Antonio Weiss go to bat for consumers while overseeing Wall Street?By Erika Eichelberger | Fri Dec. 5, 2014 6:00 AM ESTTweetEmail David Coates/APLast year, liberal darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren helped doom President Barack Obama's effort to nominate former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to head the Federal Reserve. Now the Democratic senator from Massachusetts is leading the charge to derail another Wall Street-friendly Obama nominee: investment banker Antonio Weiss. Last month, the president tapped Weiss to become the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, a position with immense power over big banks. If confirmed, consumer advocates fear, Weiss may not go to bat for average Americans while helping craft banking rules and battling Republican-led efforts to gut financial reform.
Weiss' job at Treasury would include overseeing the implementation of Wall Street reforms and consumer protection measures. He would help shape banking rules that the Treasury Department and other financial regulators must finalize over the next two years. And he would be in the room with congressional leaders and administration officials negotiating over GOP proposals that would water down financial reforms.
Weiss has spent the past 20 years at Lazard, an asset management firm that advises companies on mergers and acquisitions. He is now the firm's head of investment banking. Warren contends that Weiss is not the right man for the job because he has no experience in banking regulation and is too cozy with the financial sector. And she is leading the effort to take him down. In November, Warren vowed to vote against Weiss' confirmation, and her political operation blasted out an email ginning up opposition to him. In an op-ed in the Huffington Post last month, she said the Weiss nomination ""tells people that whatever goes wrong in this economy, the Wall Street banks will be protected first.""
Warren contends that Weiss is not the right man for the job because he has no experience in banking regulation and is too cozy with the financial sector.
A source familiar with the administration's thinking says that Weiss' background does not determine what policy positions he may take if confirmed. But since he has little regulatory experienceand most of his relationships are with people in finance,a Democratic aidetellsMother Jones, those are the people he will likely listen to.
A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on how Weiss' connections to Wall Street might conflict with his mandate to protect consumers, noting only that ""Antonio Weiss is a highly qualified nominee and we look forward to the Senate's consideration of his nomination and swift confirmation."" Weiss did not respond to a request for comment.
Weiss will have a long to-do list if he's confirmed. Not only would he weigh in on banking rules, he would also advise the president on whether to compromise with Republican efforts to modify the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill. (Obama will veto any all-out attack on Dodd-Frank, but Republicans could slip smaller measures to water it down into larger pieces of legislation that must get passed.) Here are some of the issues that could come across Weiss' desk:

One of the bills that might pass the Republican-controlled Congress in the next two years would gut new restrictions on private equity fund advisers. Weiss' current firm, Lazard, runs two private equity funds. The administration source counters that this area of the company's business is separate from the investment banking work Weiss does.
Another bill that has already passed the House would weaken a section of Dodd-Frank that requires more oversight of derivatives trading. (Derivatives are financial products whose value is based on things like currency exchange rates and crop prices.)
The Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, is looking into whether asset management firms like Lazard should be subject to tighter regulations. Weiss would serve in an advisory role on this matter.

The administration source says that Weiss' rsum does not mean that he would work to weaken rules on the financial industry. The source adds that if Weiss is confirmed, he would no longer have ties to his former employer; ethics rules require that he divest his holdings or put his investments in a blind trust.
Weiss' defendersincludingGene Sperling, a former senior economic policy maker in both the Obama and Clinton White Houses, and Neera Tanden, the president of the liberal Center for American Progresssay that his policy stances largely line up with Warren's positions. He has called for higher taxes on the rich and a more progressive tax code. Treasury Secretary Lew told the New York Times last month that Weiss opposes US companies moving overseas to avoid domestic taxationeven though his firm has helped companies do just that.
That hasn't mollified Warren and the crew of progressives she has lined up behind her. Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have also formally declared their opposition to Weiss.
Warren's anti-Weiss broadside is just the latest in her battle to push the Democratic party to the left. ""This is not at all about Antonio Weiss,"" Steve Rattner, an investment banker who worked on the 2009 auto industry bailout, told Politico on Wednesday. ""It is part of a much broader narrative of the fight for the soul of the Democratic Party and whether so-called progressives are going to capture that or whether more mainstream Democratsare going to retain it.""
Weiss' confirmation process likely won't get going until after Republicans take control of the Senate in January. He may be able to win confirmation with largely Republican votes.

The Nation,L,We Dont Just Need Nicer Cops. We Need Fewer Cops. | The Nation,"

(Creative Commons, Tony Webster)


Protests against the recent police killings of unarmed black men and boysEric Garner and Akai Gurley in New York, Michael Brown in Ferguson, John Crawford and 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Ohiohave put the policing of communities of color on the top of the local and national agenda. Signs are even emerging of a new level of social movement activity around racial justice and the criminal justice system that may outlast the current wave of anger and heartbreak.
What stands before us, therefore, is the hard work of both building political power and articulating what that change might look like. So far politicians, police and even many community leaders have trotted out many of the well-worn proposals that have failed to deliver in the past and offer little hope for the future.
Police Diversity
While the racial imbalance between the police and the policed in Ferguson was no doubt a contributing factor in the breakdown of community trust in the police, increasing police diversity is unlikely to improve things much on its own. Increasingly, large urban police departments are becoming much more diverse and reflective of the communities being policed. For years, Philadelphia police have had to live in the city, resulting in a department that largely mirrors the citys demographics. That department, however, has been rife with corruption, mismanagement and excessive use of force. As a result, residents of color have seen little relief from the daily indignities of discourtesy and aggressive criminalization. Even the NYPD has significantly enhanced its diversity in recent years in terms of race, ethnicity, gender and language skills, but few are likely to claim that this has led to a dividend of courtesy or respect.
Recent uproars over the diversity of NYPD leadership in recent months are a further red herring. There is no evidence that black and Latino police executives have been a force for moderation under either Commissioners Kelly or Bratton. Top cops like Phil Banks and Rafael Pineiro oversaw a massive expansion of stop-and-frisk under Kelly and fully embraced the over-policing of communities of color as the primary strategy for crime reduction.
Community Policing
Everyone likes the idea of a neighborhood police officer who knows and respects the community and can tell who the good guys and the bad guys are. Unfortunately, this is a mythic understanding of the history and nature of urban policing. What distinguishes the police from other city agencies is the legal authorization to use force. Their primary tools of problem solving are arrest and coercion.
While we need police to follow the law and be restrained in their use of force, we cannot expect them to be significantly more friendly given their current role in society. The reality is that when given the task of enforcing a war on drugs, stamping out quality-of-life violations and engaging in broken windows policing, their interactions with the public in high crime and disorder areas is going to be at best gruff and distant and at worst hostile and abusive. When their basic job is to criminalize all disorderly behavior, the public will resist them and view their efforts as intrusive and illegitimate, and the police will react to this resistance with defensiveness and increased assertiveness. Community policing is not possible under these conditions.
Enhanced Training
Training of police officers is notoriously inadequate and at times laughable. Officers are subjected to paramilitary drilling and discipline, lectured on paperwork and legal procedure, taught how to drive and shoot a gun, and then let loose on the public, where their colleagues quickly tell them to forget everything they learned in the academy. So, yes, training improvements are needed, but their effect on communities of color are unlikely to be significantly beneficial.
While inadequate training and supervision may have played a role in some recent high-profile incidents, the fact remains that the massive criminalization of communities of color is being carried out using proper procedures. The tens of thousands of arrests for low-level drug possession, trespassing, jumping subway turnstiles and dozens of other broken window offenses are generally carried out consistent with police policy, if not strict legal standards. Eric Garner may have been killed by improper arrest procedures and use of force, but he was also killed because the police were following orders to arrest people for selling loose cigarettes.
Community Control of the Police
Even more radical strategies like calling for community control of the police have serious drawbacks. There are two main problems. The first is that communities are not well suited for this task. Most people have very little interest or expertise in undertaking the role of managing a complex city service. In addition, no matter what it might say on paper, community power is typically no match for the entrenched bureaucratic power of the police. Numerous studies show that even when the community is supposed to be given a role in directing police services, the police quickly come to control the community process. Second, even if communities were to develop the power to direct the police, we might not like the results. Given the highly segregated nature of American cities, enclaves of racialized policing could be expected to emerge, as white communities attempt to wall themselves off from the perceived threats of outsiders. Even in communities of color, local community leaders are not always operating with the best interests of the entire community in mind. Those that tend to populate community institutions tend to be older, more conservative and closely tied to local landlords and businesses. These players are unlikely to be the source of dramatic changes in police policy.
Body Cameras
This is a reform that has some potential. But body cameras are only as effective as the accountability mechanisms in place. If local DAs and grand juries are unwilling to act on the evidence, then the courts wont be an effective tool for accountability, as we have seen in the Garner case and several others. It is possible that cameras will lead to more civil litigation and more internal disciplinary procedures, causing the city to pay out large damages to the Garner family and that one or more of the officers involved may be disciplined or even fired over their actions. Civil judgments can put pressure on departments for change and can even result in settlement agreements that mandate specific changes, as in the stop-and-frisk case. Firings and significant discipline can also alter officer behavior. Finally, the accountability mechanism of last resort is the public. The combination of critical media coverage and protest action can have the effect of shifting public opinion sufficiently or creating a governing crisis that political leaders have to address. This is what happened around stop-and-frisk when the stopping of hundreds of thousands of young men of color was transformed from a policing issue into a civil rights issue.
Police Prosecutions
It is unlikely that criminal prosecution will ever be a significant driver of police reform. There is a fundamental conflict of interest for DAs who must work closely with police and typically rely on their political support for re-election. Also, the legal standards for police use of force are incredibly permissive and give heavy weight to officer perceptions of danger at the time of the incident. We can take steps to strengthen this process. We could take prosecutions out of the hands of local DAs and turn it over to a statewide Blue Desk. This office would be responsible for investigating and prosecuting all cases of police misconduct statewide and would ideally develop the expertise and independence necessary for these difficult cases.
Changing the Police Role
What we really need, though, is a major rethink of the police role. A part of the story of over-policing is hundreds of years old and is about slave patrols, Black Codes, and Jim Crow. Another part of the story, however, is more recent. Its about the war on drugs, the war on crime and quality of life and broken windows policing. We need to push back on this dramatic expansion of police power and its role in the development of mass incarceration that has radically transformed poor communities of color in profoundly negative ways and is at the heart of the new Jim Crow.
For too long, residents in these communities have faced a terrible dilemma. On the one hand, they have suffered the consequences of high crime and disorder. It is their children who are shot and robbed. But they have also had to bear the brunt of aggressive, invasive and humiliating policing that has criminalized huge swaths of the community. There must be an alternative to this.
We have to take steps to dial back our reliance on the police as the primary tool of resolving neighborhood crime and disorder problems. For instance, we have overwhelming evidence that the policing of drugs is a corrosive and counterproductive strategy that has done nothing to reduce the negative impact of drugs on communities. Drugs are a public health problem, not a policing problem. The same approach should be taken for sex work.

Recently Mayor de Blasio announced a new $130 million package to divert people with mental illness from the criminal justice system and to better treat those who are already there. Our nations jails and prisons have become massive warehouses for the mentally ill, and this is a welcome development. However, it still rests on a foundation of police intervention. Access to services is still predicated on coming into contact with the police. The tragedy is that police are poorly trained and equipped for this role. They are primarily equipped with the tools of arrest and physical coercion, which can be incredibly counterproductive when dealing with a person in crisis. Instead, we should rely on civilian crisis intervention teams. We also need to develop community-based mental health services that dont require criminal justice involvement to access. Similar arguments can be made for dealing with homeless people.
Even more serious crime, such as violence committed by youths, may be more receptive to community-based efforts that do not rely on the punitive and coercive power of the police. Across the country community-based organizations in high-crime areas are working with young people to stop the violence using a variety of public health and community empowerment strategies. The overall effectiveness of these strategies is still being evaluated, but we know that they do not come with the many negative collateral consequences of mass criminalization.
Along the same lines, we need to get police out of schools. Numerous studies have shown that criminalizing school children worsens safety in the schools and drives the most needy students onto the streets, where they often become involved in more serious criminality. Enlightened school leaders with adequate resources have shown that they can increase school safety through creative restorative justice programs that involve students in disciplinary procedures and attempt to take home and community conditions into consideration in resolving problems.
Any real agenda for police reform must look not to make the police friendlier and more professional. Instead, it must work to reduce the police role and replace it with empowered communities working to solve their own problems. We dont need community control of the police. We need community control over services that will create safer and more stable neighborhoods and cities.

Slate,L,Homophobic slur at a funeral: Should you speak up?,"Since his death on Nov. 23, Washingtonians have continued to mourn the passing of Marion Barry, Washington, D.C.s idiosyncratic four-term mayor and longtime city councilmember. Earlier this week, a group of Barrys colleagues and supporters held a small public memorial service on the steps of the mayors office. But remembering Barrys life was suddenly sidetracked when the events emcee unexpectedly spouted homophobic and sexist sentiments. Some prominent event participants are now taking flack for not intervening. But when is it appropriate to confront a person who unleashes offensive speech?

During Barrys memorial, Al-Malik Farrakhana local gang-rehabilitation advocate and the events emceeurged ex-offenders to develop a political agenda. (So far, so good.) Then Farrakhan chose to emphasize his point by telling ex-offenders to stop acting like faggots and prostrating themselves like females. Whoa. At that moment, City Councilmember Vincent Orange and other participants were standing behind Farrakhan, seemingly unfazed by the homophobic and sexist remarks. (Orange has since condemned them.) Now many are questioning why Orange didnt immediately step in.

What are you supposed to do when somebody says something horrible during something like a eulogy? What about when Grandpas tipsy wedding toast suddenly takes a homophobic turn? Or when the minister performing the ceremony takes extra time to emphasize ONE MAN and ONE WOMAN? (We get it, you are NOT marrying two guys.)


As a member of the LGBTQ community, it can be difficult to stand idly by while somebody demeans your very existenceor someone elses for that matter. But in most cases, you should bite your tongue, take a deep breath, and assess the situation.


If the event in question is not about you (a wedding reception or a eulogy, say), tough it out. As tempting as it is to publicly shame your bigoted uncle, pursuing an on-the-spot response to homophobic remarks will only make things worse. Do your sister a favor, and hold your tongue on her wedding day. Dont make your grieving mother faint at Grandmas funeral. Families can be tricky territory for gays to navigate, and your dignity isnt necessarily the No. 1 priority on someone elses big day. While there is a way to carefully wrest the mic from grandmas hand (Thank you, Gran, for those touching words!) while giving a wink and a nod to the audience, its best done by someone else. Besides, there are probably people in the room who are just as mortified and offended as you. If youre out, youll look much bigger if you address the situation privately.


After the event (preferably in a sober environment), confront the person who made the homophobic remarks. Explain how harmful those words are to members of the LGBTQ community, and share how they make you feel. Give them a chance to make things right. Hopefully, many years down the road, you and your siblings will be able to laugh about crazy Uncle Bubbas ridiculous drunken, homophobic wedding speech.

There are times where it is fair game to interject. For example, if someone utters a gay slur during a political event or lecture, feel free to stand up and shout. Intellectual forums are fair game for admonishment. Events with group participation are OK, too. Just make sure you respond with well-thought-out words.


Finally, if its all too much, you can simply leave. This isnt fair or just, but it goes a long way to preserve personal dignity and sanity. Wait for an appropriate moment, and slip out of the event. If theres an open bar, grab a glass of bourbon and some hors doeuvres on your way out. Puff pastry makes everyone feel better.

Slate,L,Ava DuVernay profile: The Selma director on her MLK drama and being a black female director in Hollywood.,"This article originally appeared in Vulture.

Selma director Ava DuVernays father, Murray, didnt join Martin Luther King Jr. during his five-day Freedom March from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, but he wasnt far away, watching the protesters pass by his familys farm in Lowndes County, Alabama, located smack-dab between the two cities. Hes from the backwoods, where Klan snipers were hiding in the trees trying to pick off marchers, says DuVernay, whos widely expected to make some history of her own, with Selma, by becoming the first black woman to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Director. These days, her father drives a mail truck in Montgomery, says DuVernay, and one fine morning this past June, he got off his shift, headed downtown, and saw his daughter shut down the streets of the capital of the state of Alabama so she could shoot a movie about Dr. King.

DuVernay, 42, didnt just close streets for the triumphal final scene of Selma, the riveting civil-rights drama she also co-wrote, which chronicles three pivotal months that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. She took over the marble steps of Montgomerys state capitol building, the very ones that Governor George Wallace had tried to prevent King (played in Selma by David Oyelowo) from setting foot on when he made his march-capping speech. Now I had taken over that building, says the filmmaker, and my dad was standing there with a tear in his eye. That may be one of the greatest moments of my life.


Getting to that moment was a long, unlikely journey. To again point out the obvious, DuVernay is a black woman, and there arent many people like her directing movies of any budget these days, let alone a $20 million studio tentpole about a historical icon thats opening on Christmas Day. By comparison, her last movie, 2012s Middle of Nowhere, was an intimate look at the life of a woman waiting for her husband to get out of prison. It cost $200,000. This hundredfold leap is daunting stuff, but it hardly shows. The first time I meet DuVernay, she plops down next to me and starts gabbing in her great raspy voice like were old friends. Were at a decadent Paramount-hosted dinner, the existence of which indicates the studio is betting big on the movie. This isnt even a premiere; its a celebration of the first look at five minutes worth of semi-finished scenes at New Yorks Urbanworld Film Festival.


DuVernay is so charming and chatty that were about 12 shoulder squeezes and knee slaps deep before I realize she has no idea Im writing about her. Shes fully clued in three weeks later, when she picks me up in her car during a momentary escape from the Selma editing bay. Were off to get vegan soul food in Inglewood, the historically black neighborhood in South Central L.A. that was her old stomping ground. (DuVernay grew up in Lynwood, next to Compton. Her parents and four younger siblings moved to Montgomery after she finished high school.) She majored in African-American studies at UCLA, and the dreadlocked DuVernay doesnt seem far removed from those college days, looking every bit the urban intellectual in her black-framed glasses, floor-length cotton dress, army-green jean jacket, and sandals. I came here every weekend for eight years, she says as we cruise down Crenshaw Boulevard. The closest I can describe it for non-black people from the hood would be American Graffiti, she says. Kids in cars, black and brown people, looking at each other and having a good time. Back in the day, she says, theyd call it the Shaw: You going to the Shaw this Sunday? Yeah, we rollin.


Our route takes us into the hills of View Park and Leimert Park, bastions of L.A.s African-American upper and middle classes. DuVernay tried unsuccessfully to buy one of the glorious Spanish Colonial homes here. Listings dont come up in traditional sources, she says. Its all like, Miss Johnson is in the hospital, and youll be like, Woo, her house is coming up. Its very inside, and I wasnt inside. So she moved to Beachwood Canyon and spent $50,000 shed saved for a down payment on her 2010 feature debut, I Will Follow. I bought a career instead of a house, she says.


I never had a desire to be a filmmaker, DuVernay tells me. As a child and a teenager and in college, I was not aware of black women making films. But she loved movies and wanted to be around them, so after UCLA she worked as a publicist at 20th Century Fox, then started her own marketing firm at 27. Her DVA Media + Marketing specialized in delivering audiences of color to films like Dreamgirls and Invictus. She was even hired as a consulting publicist on Selma years ago when Lee Daniels was attached as the director and the U.K. producer, Path, needed help facilitating communications with the King estate. I remember getting a call from some British people asking if I would work with this film, says DuVernay. I wasnt even directing at that time.


It was while working as a unit publicist on Michael Manns 2004 L.A. neo-noir Collateral that DuVernay felt the urge to tell her own stories. She made a short film, 2006s Saturday Night Life, about a day in the life of a single mother, and followed that with 2008s This Is the Life, about the Leimert Park caf where she used to rap as part of the duo Figures of Speech, and 2010s My Mic Sounds Nice: The Truth About Women in Hip-Hop for BET, all while running her marketing company. She had an idea, inspired by a homegirl of mine, she says, that would become Middle of Nowhere. But she couldnt get funding, so she did the more modest I Will Follow, based on DuVernays experience packing up the house of an aunt who had died of cancer. Roger Ebert was an early champion, calling it the kind of film black filmmakers are rarely able to get made.


DuVernay says she remembers during the I Will Follow shoot thinking what a waste it had been to be on spin 12 years as a publicist. But eventually she realized that her years as a flack werent a hindrance. She was organized and knew how to prioritize, communicate with actors, and articulate her vision, the skills one uses as a publicist, she says. She also knew the business and co-founded the African-American Film Festival Releasing Movement, which aims to get black cinema into movie houses. AAFRM initially released I Will Follow to five theaters, and the film earned back three times its budget. Still, DuVernay kept her day job, at least for a while. The Help (2011) was the last movie for which she did publicity before putting her company on hold to make Middle of Nowhere.


She became the first African-American woman to win Best Director at Sundance for that movie. Yet the win, she says, raised my profile from zero to 2.2, maybe. Prada commissioned her to do a branded short starring Gabrielle Union, and for ESPN she made Venus Vs., about Compton native Venus Williamss fight for gender pay equality in professional tennis. They were the only two, says DuVernay. It wasnt a clamor from Hollywood at all.


***


David Oyelowo likes to tell the story of how, when he first read a Selma script in July 2007, God told me I would play the part of Martin Luther King. Unfortunately for him, the director at the time didnt agree with God. That director was Stephen Frears. He, Paul Haggis, Michael Mann, Spike Lee, and Lee Daniels were all reportedly attached before DuVernay. (Steven Spielberg is also working on his own King biopic.) When I ask Oyelowo if he believes DuVernay was divinely ordained to direct this movie, he says, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind.


As evidence, he points to the bizarreness of how I met Ava. During a 2010 round of fund-raising for Middle of Nowhere, DuVernays producing partner reached out to a Canadian friend, who reached out to his Canadian friends, one of whom sat next to Oyelowo on a flight to Vancouver. They struck up a conversation. David takes the script from a stranger and ends up calling me, says DuVernay. He says, My name is David Oyelowo, you may not know me. But Im an actor. I really loved this script, and Id love to talk to you about it. Oyelowo eventually played the part of the bus driver who gives the films protagonist a shot at new love.


Meanwhile, Daniels had taken over Selma and cast Oyelowo as King. But then he pulled out after making 2013s Lee Daniels The Butler, feeling hed made his civil-rights movie. Determined not to let the project wither, Oyelowo floated DuVernays name to the producers: I said, Look, Ive just worked with this director who is amazing with human stories. I felt that to portray Dr. King, you needed to humanize him.

Oyelowo knew thered be pushback from the producers because DuVernay hadnt handled a large production before. But as I was gaining traction, he explains, I let her know, Im having a conversation right now. I hope this is something youre actually amenable to. Then she told him that her father is from Lowndes County. I didnt have to learn Selma to make Selma, DuVernay says. I didnt have to research what kind of place this is. The people I love most in the world live in that part of the country.


Even after she was offered Selma, she needed convincing. I wasnt interested in making a Mississippi Burning through the eyes of a white protagonist, she says. The films original script was by Paul Webb, a white Englishman, and focused more on LBJs backroom political efforts to pass the Voting Rights Act. Webbs effort had landed on the Black List of best unproduced screenplays all the way back in 2007. But DuVernay said shed take the film only if she could do a rewrite. The producers agreed, and she got the job in March 2013.


My interest was showing people on the ground in Selma, says DuVernay. The band of brothers and sisters who were around King. She wrote new scenes about the battle for control between Kings Southern Christian Leadership Committee and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, as well as ones highlighting the leaders savvy strategy of creating dramatic, newsworthy images. Someone standing up against a trooper with their hands behind their back, explains DuVernay, is a more sympathetic image than someone with a rock in their hand. Her script has at least two dozen new or newly fleshed out characters, including SNCC co-founder Diane Nash (Tessa Thompson), the gay SCLC leader Bayard Rustin (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), and Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo).


The biggest change, of course, was making King central to the narrative. The challenge was doing it without citing his speecheshis estate didnt grant permission to use his words. It was worth taking creative license with Kings speeches in order to get the film made, DuVernay says. If you sit there waiting for the rights, another 50 years are going to go past.


The script wont have DuVernays name on it though. There was a contract in place before I was a twinkle in anybodys eye that Paul Webb had the prerogative to retain credit, she says. And thats where we are. The film is in the world and doing what I wanted it to do. I wish him well. (Through a representative, Webb declined to comment for this piece.)


For his part, Oyelowo says, I found myself looking at that original script thinking, How am I going to imbue this with complexity? In Avas hands, I found myself going, How am I going to rise to the occasion? He so deeply embodied King in his performance that DuVernay says some cast members didnt know he was British. I had to get to the place, says Oyelowo, where I was emanating who he was.


Also rising to the occasion was Oprah Winfrey. She came on as a producer at the request of Oyelowo, whod played her son in The Butler. Oprah carried us over the finish line, DuVernay says. She blocked and tackled for me. DuVernay also persuaded Winfrey to play the part of Annie Lee Cooper, a woman subjected to unfair literacy exams when she tries to register to vote. Her first scene in the movie was on the day Maya Angelou died. I said, Lets reschedule, recalls DuVernay. She said, No, Im going to do this for her.


Freedom Fighters John Lewis and Andrew Young, who appear as characters in the film, were frequently on set. One marcher, still bearing scars from when one of Wallaces goons assaulted him, was also an extra in the film. You cant honor somebodys story, says cinematographer Bradford Young, and not let them be part of the process. Perhaps the productions hardest day involved creating the brutal, frenetic Bloody Sunday sequence, when protesters are rushed by whip-cracking state police. On the day of shooting, rain stoppages kept ruining scene continuity, and there werent enough people to fill out the mayhem. But DuVernay kept cool. Logistically, I likened staging Bloody Sunday to managing a red carpet at the Manns Chinese and shutting down Hollywood Boulevard, she says. Youre organizing a lot of activity around one focal point. At a red carpet, its when Charlize Theron gets out of the car; on Selma, its David as King.


***


When I left DuVernay in mid-October, she was overseeing a Los Angeles sound studio trying to relocate a little girls laugh she knew had gone missing from Selmas opening scene, which cuts between King receiving the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize and four doomed Alabama black girls in their Sunday best tromping down the steps of Birminghams 16th Street Baptist Church on September 15, 1963. Theres a giggle on the stairs thats not on the track, DuVernay told her engineersand it was essential, she insisted, that we hear that bright burst of joy and life before a Ku Klux Klanplanted bomb rips through the building.



  Selma's ensemble cast. Atsushi Nishijima -  2014 Paramount Pictures Corporation. All Rights Reserved.


 

The first audience to witness that explosion wasatL.A.s AFI Fest in early November. DuVernay arrived having been up for 37 hours straight, working on postproduction with her longtime editor, Spencer Averick. They were both feeling loopy and emotionally raw. We almost threw in the towel, says Averick. It felt like, Okay, this is not going to work out. DuVernay was so ragged that she didnt notice that people were clapping and crying during the screening. I was floating through the whole thing, she says. They were wheeling me around like Bernie in Weekend at Bernies.


She was able to pay better attention later that month, when Selma earned another standing ovation at its first full New York airing. The film is now firmly established as an Oscar front-runner. I saw DuVernay there looking (slightly) well rested in a long striped skirt and pink cashmere sweater. Despite the acclaim, the work wasnt done. Jazz musician Jason Moran was putting the final touches on the score, and shed be tweaking till her deadline, four days away. Its like a sculpture that everyone wants, but the edge is not rounded yet, she said about Selma. Just give me two seconds to get that part done! Thats how I feel.


DuVernay was up against the clock, but in a far more profound way, her timing is right on. The afternoon of the New York screening, Missouri governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, allowing him to have the National Guard intervene in anticipated protests in reaction to the Ferguson grand-jury decision. It was hard not to think of Selma, 1965. The current dismantling of the Voting Rights Act and the breaking of the black body at the hands of police, this is not new, DuVernay pointed out.


Selma resonates keenly now, but DuVernay knows its existence is a little lucky. She could be stuck in developing or financing. She could still be working PR on someone elses movie. For a film to be made is a small miracle, she said. And sometimes its a large one.

Slate,L,Israeli election: Don't assume Benjamin Netanyahu's job is safe.,"When Benjamin Netanyahu fired his finance and justice ministers this week and called for early elections to be held in three months, it seemed like the Israeli prime minister would likely retain his position and expand the power of his right-wing coalition.

Barring a major upset, Beyonc will likely get a nomination in that category for her 2013 self-titled surprise album. But shes already made a bit of Grammy history: With her nomination for Best Urban Contemporary album, she has, as Billboard notes, surpassed Dolly Parton as the most nominated woman in Grammy history.

Coming into today, she and Parton were tied at 46 nominations. With her 47th nomination, Beyonc is seventhplace on the all-time list for all artists, tied with David Foster. Quincy Jones remains the most nominated musician with an astounding 79 nominations to date over the course of the award shows 57 years.

Slate,L,Linda Tirado on the realities of living in bootstrap America: daily annoyances for most people are catastrophic for poor people.,"Excerpted from Hand to Mouth: Living in Bootstrap America by Linda Tirado. Out now from Putnam.

I once lost a whole truck over a few hundred bucks. It had been towed, and when I called the company they told me theyd need a few hundred dollars for the fee. I didnt have a few hundred dollars. So I told them when I got paid next and that Id call back then.


It was a huge pain in the ass for those days. It was the rainy season, and I wound up walking to work, adding another six miles or so a day to my imaginary pedometer. It was my own fault that Id been towed, really, and I spent more than a couple hours ruing myself. I finally made it to payday, and when I went to get the truck, they told me that I now owed over a thousand dollars, nearly triple my paycheck. They charged a couple hundred dollars a day in storage fees. I explained that I didnt have that kind of money, couldnt even get it. They told me that I had some few months to get it together, including the storage for however long it took me to get it back, or that theyd simply sell it. They would, of course, give me any money above and beyond their fees if they recovered that much.


    Advertisement




I was working two jobs at the time. Both were part time. Neither paid a hundred bucks a day, much less two.



Anything can make you lose your apartment, because any unexpected problem can set off that Rube Goldberg device.



I wound up losing my jobs. So did my husband. We couldnt get from point A to point B quickly enough, and we showed up to work, late, either soaked to the skin or sweating like pigs one too many times. And with no work, we wound up losing our apartment.


Its amazing what things that are absolute crises for me are simple annoyances for people with money. Anything can make you lose your apartment, because any unexpected problem that pops up, like they do, can set off that Rube Goldberg device.


One time I lost an apartment because my roommate got a horrible flu that we suspected was maybe something worse because it stayed forever--she missed work, and I couldnt cover her rent. Once it was because my car broke down and I missed work. Once it was because I got a weeks unpaid leave when the company wanted to cut payroll for the rest of the month. Once my fridge broke and I couldnt get the landlord to fix it, so I just left. Same goes for the time that the gas bill wasnt paid in a utilities-included apartment for a week, resulting in frigid showers and no stove. Thats why we move so much. Stuff like that happens.


Because our lives seem so unstable, poor people are often seen as being basically incompetent at managing their lives. That is, its assumed that were not unstable because were poor, were poor because were unstable. So lets just talk about how impossible it is to keep your life from spiraling out of control when you have no financial cushion whatsoever. And lets also talk about the ways in which money advice is geared only toward people who actually have money in the first place.


I once read a book for people in poverty, written by someone in the middle class, containing real-life tips for saving pennies and such. Its all fantastic advice: buy in bulk, buy a lot when theres a sale on, hand-wash everything you can, make sure you keep up on vehicle and indoor filter maintenance.



 


 

Of course, very little of it was actually practicable. Bulk buying in general is cheaper, but you have to have a lot of money to spend on stuff you dont actually need yet. Hand-washing saves on the utilities, but nobody actually has time for that. If I could afford to replace stuff before it was worn out, vehicle maintenance wouldnt be much of an issue, but you really cant rinse the cheap filters and againquality costs money up front. In the long term, it makes way more sense to buy a good toaster. But if the good toaster is 30 bucks right now, and the crappiest toaster of them all is 10, it doesnt matter how many times I have to replace it. Ten bucks it is, because I dont have any extra tens.


It actually costs money to save money.


It is impossible to be good with money when you dont have any. Full stop. If Im saving my spare five bucks a week, in the best-case scenario I will have saved $260 a year. For those of you that think in quarters: $65 per quarter in savings. If you deny yourself even small luxuries, thats the fortune youll amass. Of course you will never manage to actually save it; youll get sick at least one day and miss work and dip into it for rent. Gas will spike and youll need it to get to work. Youll get a tear in your work pants that you cant patch. Something, I guarantee you, will happen in three months.


When I have a few extra dollars to spend, I cant afford to think about next monthmy present day situation is generally too tight to allow me that luxury. Ive got kids who are interested in their quality of life right now, not 10 years from now. 


Heres the thing: we know the value of money. We work for ours. If were at 10 bucks an hour, we earn 83 cents, before taxes, every five minutes. We know exactly what a dollars worth; its counted in how many more times you have to duck and bend sideways out the drive through window. Or how many floors you can vacuum, or how many boxes you can fill.

Its impossible to win, unless you are very lucky. For you to start to do better, something has to go rightand stay that way for long enough for you to get on your feet. Ive done well in years that I had a job I didnt mind terribly and that paid me well enough to get into an apartment that met all the basic standards. Ive done less well in years where I didnt have steady work. The troubles been that my luck simply hasnt held out for long enough; it seems like just when Ive caught up, something happens to set me back again. Ive been fortunate enough that its rarely compounded, and Ive stayed at under sea level for short periods instead of long-term. But Ive stared long-term in the face long enough to have accepted it as a real possibility. Its only an accident and a period of unemployment away.

The Descriptive Catalogue of Special Devices and Supplies, used by British spies sent to the Continent to track Nazi movements and aid resistance fighters during World War II, has been recently reprinted by the Imperial War Museum. These pages from the back of the two-volume catalogue, which was published in 1944 and 1945, show a few of the ways that the Special Operations Executive (the name for the secret British agency charged with training and deploying these agents) managed to sneak arms and ammunition to its operatives.


As historian-author Sinclair McKay writes in the introduction to the new volume, the Special Operations Executive trained many volunteers and recruits with no previous experience in the field. The recruits underwent crash courses, with SOE personnel bringing them quickly up to speed on the use of weapons and explosives, the maintenance of communications equipment, and the cultures of the places they were to infiltrate.

The two volumes of the manual are packed full of explanations of the many devices SOE operatives might encounter, or choose to use, in their operations. The first volume covers more conventional suppliesunderwater breathing equipment; guns, bombs, and knives; dehydrated rations in the style of the MRE.


The second volume describes the wireless radio equipment that would be essential to the missions of many of the spies, and then devotes half of its space to explain camouflaging techniques like the ones below. This section includes advice on personal camouflagemakeup and costumingas well as explaining the many devices that the SOE had evolved for transporting illicit goods through occupied Europe.

Slate,L,"Felix Salmon on Slate Money: I told listeners Id match their charity donations and ended up spending nearly $20,000.","The Nov. 15 edition of the Slate Money podcast was never going to be an easy one. Of the three regular panelists, Cathy ONeil was going to be in Haiti, Jordan Weissmann was going to be in Orlando, Florida, and I found myself at the last minute having to be in Miami. So I decided to change tack and do something a bit different: a whole podcast devoted to philanthropy, featuring two special guests. One was Jesse Eisinger, who had just published a sadly unsurprising expos about the American Red Cross (theres now a follow-up, too); the other was Rob Reich, the Stanford University political scientist whos my favorite observer of the philanthropic world.

All three of us are pretty cynical people, especially about philanthropy, and yet there was a tinge of hope to the podcast, especially toward the end, when Reich started talking about Giving Tuesday. And so, in a moment of inspiration, or madness, or some combination of the two, I announced to all our listeners that if they donated money to Doctors Without Borders by Giving Tuesday, Dec. 2, I would match their donation, within reason.


What was I thinking? Well, Doctors Without Borders has long been my favorite charity, and my wife and I have been giving money to them, annually, for many years. But right now, to say extra special thanks for their heroic efforts to fight Ebola in West Africa, I felt it was time to do something extra special on my end, too. I had no real idea what to expect, but for some reason, in the back of my head, I had the number $5,000. If we got 50 people donating an average of $100, or 100 people donating an average of $50, then that would come to $5,000, which I could then double to get to a nice round grand total of $10,000.



The total I was mentally matching continued to rise, day after day, sometimes hour after hour.



    Advertisement




Obviously, there was nothing particularly strategic or organized about my pledge. I didnt ask for any particular proof or documentation; a simple email saying I just donated would suffice. And it was certainly interesting to see what people were willing to reveal about themselves in order to get the matching donation. Some were happy to forward on the full receipts from Doctors Without Borders; others redacted their addresses; a few of them didnt even give their names. (One email just came from a nameless email address called Padrhig in South Korea, attaching a blurry photograph of an envelope with Korean writing on it. That got added to the tally too.) The only emails I decided not to match were the ones clearly outside the promise: donations that had already been made by the time the podcast came out, or donations to other charities entirely, or pledges to donate at some vague time in the future. Other than that, I decided I was not going to get into the business of second-guessing who seemed genuine and who didnt.


A week later, when I recorded what we decided to call the Matching Gift edition of Slate Money, I was incredibly happy to be able to announce that wed reached a total of slightly more than $4,000 pledged. My gut, it seemed, had been right. I knew there was still quite a long way to go until Dec. 2 but reckoned that we were going to have diminishing returns from that point onward.


Boy was I wrong. In fact, even as I was recording that podcast, a new email was coming in, from a gentleman who had donated 72 shares of Microsoft, worth $3,442.32.


That email, I think, was the tipping point. I could have just drawn the line at $5,000 and said that my limit had been reachedbut that felt unfair to everybody who had yet to donate anything. And so I started thinking: What if I didnt draw the line? What if I matched even a donation of $3,442.32?


That thought never really went away, even as the donations kept on coming in. Most were between $50 and $500, but there were quite a few on either side of that range, including a number of pledges to contribute monthly. (I had no idea what to do with those.) And it wasnt just dollars and Microsoft stock, either: We got pledges in pounds, and euros, and Australian dollars, and Canadian dollars, and even Swedish kronor. All of them went into my spreadsheet, where the grand total kept on ticking steadily upward.




If someone had come to me immediately after I made the pledge and asked if I would match some five-figure sum, I would have said nothat was not my idea of within reason. But the grand total rose slowly, and at every point on its rise it anchored itself. Once I was mentally committed to donating $5,000, then that money was mentally spent, and then the next $100 donation only required me matching $100, a mere 2 percent of what Id already spent. Who was I to say no to increasing my match by 2 percent? And so the total I was mentally matching continued to rise, day after day, sometimes hour after hour.


The emails were also just wonderful to read, especially the ones from other people involved in the show (thanks, Stan Alcorn and Jesse Eisinger!) and from people who said that they would normally have given to the Red Cross but had switched over to Doctors Without Borders after listening. I also managed to goad the Economists Matthew Bishop, over Twitter, into matching my match: He said that hed donate 50 cents for every dollar of my own, up to $5,000. The total, at this point, was getting really big!


And then, a day before the deadline, the slow-and-steady rise in donations came to an end. With a fast-and-enormous donation from one Jesse Abelson, who sent us a long and incredibly thoughtful email, which included the news that he was donating $40,000 to Doctors Without Borders from his family foundation.


That put the grand total over the top and forced me to cry uncle. So, how much should I donate, in total, given that, with Abelsons $40,000, I cant match everything? Well, looking at the list, there are 114 donations in total. The average donation is $520, thanks to Abelson; the median, however, is $100. So I decided that I would match all donations up to five times the median, or $500. Which means that Im writing a check to Doctors Without Borders for $19,724.66.


And when you add in all the pledges, including Abelsons $40,000 and Bishops $5,000, the grand total weve managed to raise for Doctors Without Borders is an amazing $90,946.90.


Can I afford to give almost $20,000 to Doctors Without Borders? The short answer is yeseven though its four times as much as I initially thought Id end up giving. One way Im thinking about it is that I dont have kids, and this is less than the amount of money Id spend to send even one kid to university for one year. Another way Im thinking about it is that even after making this donation, my net worth is going to be higher at the end of 2014 than it was at the beginning. The markets have gone up, raising the value of my retirement savings, my apartment has risen in value, and Im in my prime earning years. So yes, I can do this.


But its not just that I can do this; I really want to do this, too. I feel really happy about doing it, and Id feel bad if I didnt. Helping to raise some $91,000 for Doctors Without Borders is surely the best thing Ive done this year. And although this is emphatically a one-off, not-to-be-repeated thing, I have to say that in my heart of hearts, I kinda want to do it again.

Slate,L,"Cult film slang: Words first cited in the OED from Heathers, Pulp Fiction, Withnail and I, Ghostbusters, Blade Runner, Spinal Tap","Cultfilms are slippery customers. One person's cult film is another'smainstreamhit, and both would probably be prepared to fight to the death to defend their opinion. For some, a film can only be described as ""cult"" if just a handful of people have seen it. For others, it is a film that did not achieve mainstream success when it was first released, but gradually built up a significant following byword of mouth. Whatever you think, cult films are a vital part of our culture, and thus our language, so let'szoom inon some films that have been generally accepted as ""cult classics""that have been quoted in theOxford English Dictionary(OED).

Heathers (1988)


    Advertisement




Heather Chandler: You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn'talready the head of it, I'dwant the same thing.
 Veronica: I'msorry? What are you oozing about?


Heathers is a brilliantlyquotablecult film, but did you know it is also one of the most frequently cited films in theOED, with David Waters"" script providing evidence for words or senses in eleven quotations?


The film supplies evidence forperfecto,hang(as in to pass time idly or aimlessly),righteous(a synonym for excellent, cool),much(""God Veronica, drool much?""), andI'msorry(as in the quotation above, where it is used interrogatively, requesting the repetition of words that the speaker failed to hear or understand, or finds hard to believe). Perhaps saving the best for last, the film also provides evidence forcow tipping, which refers to the activity of pushing over a sleeping cow. Do not try this at home kids.


Pulp Fiction (1994)


I ain'tthrough with you by a damn sight. I'mgonna git Medieval on your ass.


Pulp Fiction, the first independent film togrossover $200 million, is another hugely quotable film that provides a number of citations in theOED.


Quentin Tarantino'sscript provides evidence for words includingoverprice,little man, andgangsta, and phrases includingto be caught with one'spants downmeaning ""to be caught off guard"" andto get medievalmeaning 'to use violence or extreme measures on"". Interestingly, it is not just the dialogue, butstage directionswithin the script text that are used in citations. One direction reads: ""Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 cherry-red Chevy Malibu convertible The background is a colorful process shot"", and provides evidence in theOEDforprocess shot, meaning a shot made using process projection.


Withnail and I (1987)


Withnail: What are you gonna do with those?
 Danny: The joint I'mabout to roll requires a craftsman. It can utilise up to twelve skins. It is called a Camberwell carrot.


Withnail and I falls under the classic ""sleeper hit"" definition of a cult film. It opened in cinemas in 1987, received some good reviews, and then disappeared from screens. But over the years it became a word of mouth classic, thanks toVHSand DVD sales, and now it is often screened as a ""quote along"" event.


In terms of itslinguisticlegacy, two quotations from Bruce Robinson's script feature in theOED. It is featured in the entry forblack, in the section where objects are prefixed, by way of comparison: ""A jade streak in his hair and night-black shades."" And thenotorious""Camberwell carrot"" quotation above provides evidence forskin, meaning cigarette paper.


Ghostbusters (1984)


This chick is toast


While Ghostbusters may be considered as pushing the ""cult"" definition a bit too much, having had neither limitedexposurenor limited commercial success, it's just too difficult to resist including this excellent quote that found its way into theOED. Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis's script actually reads: ""Okay. That's it! I'm gonna turn this guy into toast."" But thanks to somead-libbingfrom Bill Murray  ""This chick is toast""  it was instead theprolepticform which gainedcurrency. And if a film becomes considered cult because of the passion of its fans, then Ghostbusters can certainly be said to have a cult following.


Blade Runner (1980)


The big religious boys said that replicants, no matter how human, were objects, only God could make people.


On first release Blade Runner receivedpolarizedreviews from the critics, and had relatively low ticket sales in the US. Despite this it did not take long for the film to attain cult classic status. It was actually one of the first films to be released on DVD, in Japan in 1996, perhaps in part because the film'sambiguityandcomplexityrewards repeat viewings.


Though based on the Philip K. Dick bookDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,it is the film rather than the book that provides theOED's first recorded evidence for the wordreplicant. The book uses the wordandroid, orandy.


Spinal Tap (1984)


David and Nigel, they're like poets y'know, like Shelley and Byron, or people like that. They're two distinct types of visionaries  it'slike fire and ice, basically. I feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.


This is Spinal Tap, as with many of the films on this list, had only modest success on first release, but has built up a massive cult following in the last 30 years. Unfortunately the quote above does not actually appear in theOxford English Dictionary, it was just included as a gift to you. The film does howeverfind its place in theOEDunder the entry formockumentary,where it is referenced in a 1987 article in the Washington Post.


So next time you're watching your favourite film, why not turn the volumeup to elevenand quote along, happy in the knowledge that even if it didn't win anyOscars, what better prize is there than being remembered forever in theOxford English Dictionary?

An analysis of 14 million records by the Sunlight Foundation found that in return, these companies received $4.4 trillion in federal business and support, or $760 for every $1 spent To put that in context, the federal government paid $4.3 trillion in Social Security benefits over the same period to 50 million Americans.

They put poison on his skin and in the air he breathed. Benzene is a key ingredient in gas and cigarettes. Its a component for producing plastics, adhesives, lubricants, and pesticides. And chronic exposure is linked to leukemia and other cancers. But as one of the most produced chemical in the U.S., it has a powerful industry behind it. An investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that a $36 million study funded by Americas oil and chemical titans was designed to protect member company interests against lawsuits by those with leukemia or other diseases that have been correlated with benzene exposure. Industry reps say research is sound. Authors of the work claim no bias. But experts say the research, and the strategy the industry employs, shields companies from workers compensation claims.

Adopted or kidnapped? Right now, Americans cannot adopt Guatemalan children. But at one point it was a big business. From 1996 to 2006, the number of adopted children from Guatemala increased 663 percent, and agency fees for adopting parents ranged from $20,000 to $50,000. But that business, in some cases, boiled down to human trafficking. Such are the claims surrounding Karen Abigail Lpez Garca, a child adopted by a Missouri couple. Her Guatemalan parents claim she was kidnapped and essentially sold to an American adoption agency.

Celebrities get preferential treatment in ... NTSB investigations? Yes, the National Transportation Safety Board cites the prominence of the crash victims in in a manual that determines how many officials are sent to investigate crash sites. A USA Today analysis of 600 recent NTSB investigations found that the agencys typical response is to send out four or five people. But high-profile incidents, like the fatal crash involving John F. Kennedy Jr., often draw outsized responses (the agency dispatched 56 people to investigate Kennedys crash). Officials say they use these high profile cases to address a wide audience of pilots and the public, to quell speculation and to deal with the media. But some of the most extensive investigations revealed very little about what actually led to the crashes.  USA Today via @rlocker12

Slate,L,The New Republics demise: The magazines heterodox liberalism is what made it unique.,"The bloodletting this week at the New Republicthe journal of opinion regarded for a century as the flagship of American liberalismhas been rightly taken to herald the end of a great magazine. With the news that its two top editors, Frank Foer and Leon Wieseltier, resigned, that much of the staff subsequently quit, and that the magazine will halve its yearly output and move its headquarters from Washington to New York, the political and intellectual worlds are thrumming with outrage toward the short-sightedness of the magazines new leadership and elegies for an august institution.


The New Republic honored the journalistic imperative to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.



As a former staffer and (until Friday) contributing editor, I share the sadness. But one reason for the New Republics demise has not been fully appreciated, and that has to do with its unique tradition of heterodox liberalism. The New Republic is being seen as a casualty of the crisis of print journalism that has felled many other newspapers and magazines during the past decadethe drying up of advertising revenue amid free and cheap online commentary. The problem with this line of argument is that little magazines have always lost money, relying instead on the largesse of rich owners, whose combination of public-spiritedness and vanity has led them to sponsor high-quality journalism. The New Republic was hurt by something more specific: the polarization of a media environment that leaves little room for a strain of liberal thought that not only attacks the right and the far left but also prods and questions liberalism itself.


Founded in 1914 by some of the leading minds of the Progressive EraHerbert Croly, Walter Lippmann, and Walter Weylthe New Republic from the beginning sought to challenge conventional thinking, including among its own readership. These editors recognized that while liberalism (like all political creeds) needs foundational principles, one of those principles specific to liberalism is openness to debate, experiment, and reconsideration. Dogmatism, even more than conservatism, was its bte noire.

Over the years the magazine sometimes wavered in that mission. During the editorial tenure of former Vice President Henry Wallace in the 1940s, it descended into high-minded clich, and for spells in the postwar years, it lapsed into sleepy predictability. But with its purchase by Harvard professor Martin Peretz in the mid-1970s, the New Republic regained its stature as the most provocative magazine on the left. Peretz hired a bevy of brilliant young minds. Three in particular became the three finest editors of their generation: Michael Kinsley, Hendrik Hertzberg, and Wieseltier. The twentysomethings who cut their teeth at the magazine in these decades include some of the most accomplished nonfiction writers working today.


As important, the magazine played a key role in revitalizing American liberalism. When Peretz bought the New Republic, the left was on the ropes. The 1960s had been great years of progressive achievement, but in the 1970s, voters were growing disaffected from the Democratic Party, which failed to develop new ideas to meet the challenges of a changing economy and a turbulent world. Liberal thinking ossified. When I was growing up, the adjective that most often preceded liberal was knee-jerk.


Under Peretz and his editors, the magazine led the way in questioning left-wing shibboleths on issues such as crime and fiscal policy and especially foreign policy, where it championed a revival of the liberal internationalism that had guided the Democratic Party from Woodrow Wilson through John F. Kennedy, until the disaster of Vietnam. The election in 1992 of Bill Clinton, whose candidacy the magazine supported early on, marked a triumph of this reconstructed liberalism.




Some old-time subscribers and confirmed partisans disliked the magazine for its willingness to publish conservative voicesFred Barnes was its ace White House correspondent for years while staff writer Charles Krauthammer migrated during his time at the magazine from Walter Mondale speechwriter to neoconservative paragon. Critics assailed its perceived hawkishness and its unapologetic Zionism, which had long been anathema to the hard left and was now becoming distasteful to certain high-minded progressives as well.


But to other readers, the sense of freewheeling debateas opposed to bien-pensant wisdom or party-line doctrinegave the magazine its exciting appeal. As a college student in the late 1980s, I found its pages more stimulating than those of rival publications, which tended to toe what was already being called the politically correct line. I never agreed with all of the magazines positionsits support of the Nicaraguan contras, its opposition to affirmative actionbut its pieces made me think in ways that few newspaper columnists or television pundits did. Beyond affording the pleasures of contrarianism, this breed of journalism honored the journalistic imperative to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. Who, after all, was more comfortable than ones own loyal readers?


The New Republics heterodox liberalismthe willingness (indeed the eagerness!) to test liberal thinking from within the liberal familyis now being squeezed. Internet journalism has made it easy to find opinions that confirm ones own beliefs and flatter ones prejudices. Facebook places soothing assurances before our eyeballs. The left and the right are retreating into cocoons of information and opinion, on cable TV and social media.


Accordingly, the New Republics fortunes flagged amid the polarization of the Bush years, when its full-throated support for the Iraq war was too much for even many liberal internationalists to bear and when, post-Clinton, liberalism now seemed to need a course correction toward the left, not the center. Though Foer dynamically reinvigorated the magazine, it never regained the wider circulation it once enjoyed.

Wiser ownership could have recognized that although little magazines must adapt to the digital age with strategies for reaching social media users and mobile phone readers, they will never be cash cows. They succeed through influence, not volume. When I worked there in the early 1990s, it was often said that while the magazine had only 100,000 subscribers, it was the right 100,000the political movers who turned to the piercing policy critiques, the intellectuals who engaged with Wieseltiers unsurpassed back of the book.


The impending transformation of the New Republic from a liberal magazine into a vertically integrated digital media company is regrettable for many reasons, not all of them sentimental. Conservatives need a liberal magazine thats unpredictable enough to make them want to read it. Liberals and leftists need a magazine that will prod them to question their beliefs, and revise or strengthen them. All of us need robust intellectual debate of a high caliber that treats politics and ideas with the seriousness that they deserve.

Slate,L,"Gluten-free fad: Dont be annoyed, says celiac disease memoirist.","If an appearance on South Park is a sign of cultural saturation, then we have reached peak gluten-free. In a recent episode, gluten is banned in the town, and men in hazmat suits force a beer drinker into quarantine at Papa Johns. Mocked in New Yorker cartoons and lampooned by Jimmy Kimmel, gluten-free eating has become a staple of satire. Its shorthand for solipsism, for a certain kind of over-privileged self-care.

Theres no doubt that the diet has become the food fad of the decadea recent study says that a third of Americans have considered cutting out gluten. Since a fad is, by definition, a short-lived enthusiasm for something with no regard for its objective merits, those who follow fads are, by implication, impressionable, flighty, kind of dim. Thats the attitude taken by the author of a recent New Yorker article about the subject. I am certainly not going to live without gluten, Michael Specter writes at the very end of the piece. That just seems silly.


But Im here to speak for the silly ones, the dim bulbs, the gluten avoiders. I have a world of sympathy for food fad followers. I once was one.


    Advertisement




In the early 90s, when I spent a college semester in Bogot, Colombia, I would walk an hour from my apartment to a health food store that sold fat-free whole-wheat bread. Id been having stomachaches, and friends told me Id feel better if I cut fat out of my diet and ate whole grains. I ate the loaf on the way home from the store, stopping periodically as my stomach seized up in pain. The doctor I consulted told me that Bogots violence was causing me anxiety.


A few years later, when I was living in a small town in western Colorado, I drove to the nearest hospital after weeks of frightening fatigue. The doctor I consulted told me I had woman problems. There was nothing he could do to help. To help myself, I became macrobiotic, because everyone around me was becoming macrobiotic. I paid a 16-year-old hippie girl who cooked for the local co-op to teach me about the diet. She lived high on a mesa where she pulled wheat gluten in the bathtub to make seitan that her mother would sell. I ate this seitan, looking out the window at the mountains, and waited to feel better.


I visited yet another doctor in San Francisco in the late 90s. My periods rarely came, I had sores on my tongue, my teeth occasionally broke in half. I was sent home with a trial pack of antacids. I had irritable bowel syndrome, the doctor said, and should avoid spicy foods and dairy. So I became vegan like my roommate, sprinkling her nutritional yeast on my rice and lentils.


For years I ate exactly as Michael Pollan now exhorts us all to eat. I ate food. Not too much. Mostly plants. And I felt terrible.


By the time I moved to New York in 2000, I couldnt turn my head or carry a purse because of the constant pain in my neck. A doctor, alarmed by my iron levels and concerned that I had an ulcer, ordered an endoscopy. I was diagnosed with celiac disease, a condition in which gluten wreaks havoc on a body. It had destroyed my intestines absorptive capacity, leaving me unable to take in nutrients. According to the gastroenterologist I saw for a follow-up, all I needed to do to restore the health that had eluded me since toddlerhood was to cut out any trace of gluten from my diet.


That day, I was given a miracle cure. And over the next 10 years, my cure became a fad.




I dont believe that avoiding gluten is the cure for most illness. But I sympathize with those who try it, who are searching for their own miracle the way I looked for mine in macrobiotics and veganism. Such sympathy is hard to find in the public discourse, which is more often aligned with this caption to a recent New Yorker cartoon: Ive only been gluten-free for a week, but Im already really annoying.


I can think of something even more annoying than someone ordering rice pasta. Its being sick without known cause or cure. A study of more than 1,400 primary care patients found that 22 percent of them had multiple, medically unexplained physical symptoms. Heres what happens when doctors cant explain our persistent and impairing symptoms: We become suggestible. We follow fads. And then we get mocked for it.


Its true that theres no scientific proof that most people should follow the gluten-free diet. Is there such a thing as nonceliac gluten sensitivity? Possibly, but nobodys sure. Are todays most common varieties of wheat harder to digest than varieties of the past? Again, no one knows for sure. Can avoiding gluten decrease the severity of symptoms for autoimmune sufferers? You guessed it: Theres no answer.


But commerce depends upon certainty. Its easy to find online nutritionists claiming that 30 percent of the population suffers from gluten sensitivity. There are gluten-free coaches and gluten-free lifestyle magazines and pricey gluten-free membership programs that traffic in miraculous transformations. Market researchers have encouraged food companies to provide more gluten-free options, because, as Harry Balzer, a food researcher with NPD Group, told NPR, Everyone has digestive problemseveryone. You can buy a take-at-home gluten sensitivity test for $279, even though most celiac doctors agree that the test is useless.


Its far from ideal to get health information from coaches, marketers, and listserv commenters. But in a country with such an insufficient health care systemone in which patients have such limited time with doctors and diseases that lack pharmaceutical cures, such as celiac, receive little money for researchis it any wonder that we turn to a marketplace so eager to sell us well-being?


Its possible that the entire gluten-free craze might have been avoided if celiac disease hadnt been ignored for so long in our country. For most of the latter half of the 20th century, American physicians rarely researched or diagnosed celiac, unlike their European counterparts, and they considered the disease extremely rare. Even now that celiac is known to be one of the countrys most common autoimmune maladies, more than a million Americans are still walking around with undiagnosed celiac. They may suffer from unexplained symptoms; theyre at increased risk for a slew of diseases including thyroid disease, diabetes, and cancer; and the Mayo Clinic says theyre four times as likely to die prematurely as someone without celiac. Celiac afflicts 1 percent of our population, but the vast majorityas much as 83 percentof that 1 percent are undiagnosed.


Compare this situation with that in Italy, where every child is screened for celiac disease before the age of 6. Gluten-free food is considered medicine and available in pharmacies, and restaurants offering gluten-free items are strictly regulated. Those with celiac get a food stipend as well as paid time off for medical appointments. Unsurprisingly, theres no gluten-free craze in Italy.

If our country had a sufficient public health response to celiacif doctors were trained to recognize the multitudinous symptoms of the disease and tested widely for it, if insurance companies agreed to pay for endoscopies, if most people with the disease were diagnosed, and if gluten-free food were considered medicine for this specific and recognizable diseasewould the gluten-free diet have taken such hold of our collective imagination? Theres no way to know for sure, but I do know that the trend has sprouted up in a particularly fertile environment. Theres a shortage of information on and screening for the one disease that is definitively caused by gluten. There are some very preliminary studies about the broader dangers of gluten. There are, as always, plenty of people who dont feel good. And theres a marketplace ready to profit on the suffering and the half-facts.


I understand that the rapidity of the fads growth might make the diet seem suspect, but its wrong to blame the dieters. Were mocking those who are trying to help themselves with the limited information they have at hand. Were pointing fingers at the present-day equivalent of the young woman on the mesa with sores in her mouth eating seitan, and I can tell you with the brilliant clarity of hindsight that shes not to blame.

Slate,L,"Mongolian nomads: Ambitious program uses solar panels to connect regions 800,000 nomads to the grid.","EachFriday,Roads & KingdomsandSlatepublish a new dispatch from around the globe. For more foreign correspondence mixed with food, war, travel, andphotography, visit theironline magazineor follow@roadskingdomson Twitter.

TSETSERLEG, MongoliaAs the crow flies, Gaaj, one of Mongolias 800,000 fully nomadic citizens, doesnt live too far from Ulaanbaatar, the countrys capital and only metropolis. His yak-felt-and-wood tent, or ger, stands in a valley 360 miles away, just outside of Tsetserleg, the administrative and commercial nexus of the Arkhangai province.


But crows and maps are deceptive in Mongoliathey hide how rapidly Ulaanbaatars urban sprawl gives way to endless open plains and isolation. At 603,910 square miles, Mongolia is the 19th largest nation in the world, but 1.2 of its 2.8 million citizens live in the capital with the rest in far-flung villages or living nomadically like Gaaj. It has the lowest population density of any sovereign nation. Underlining this fact, the trip out to Gaajs ger from the Dragon Bus Station on the eastern fringe of Ulaanbaatar is eight hours of an unending procession of yak dung and skulls dotting the plains.

These remains bear testament to the comings and goings of nomadic herds. Although elsewhere in the nation youre apt to wander into valleys choking with goats or sheep, yaks predominate in this region, where herders rely on them for almost every necessity. Yak fur socks and yak felt walls keep them warm. Yak meat jerky so hard it has to be broken up with an axe and boiled like shoe leather, served with hot and salty yak milk-and-butter tea, fills their bellies. Tiny balls of rock-hard cheese, tucked against the cheek and sucked over long rides, keep them occupied as they navigate the unpaved hills on tiny, plodding, sturdy ponies.


Although motorcycles and a smattering of cars help a nomad get to town on short notice, these steeds (or camels in the Gobi Desert) are the best way to move tiny herds in slow, regular annual orbits around the towns and markets the herders frequent to sell their excess meat and crafts, moving forward as the grazing gets scarce. Its not an easy life, but the connection to land and livestock is what theyve grown up with. And the city, smoggy with coal fire, often more expensive, and lacking in easy, secure work for those with few skills or experience that dont involve milking or shearing, doesnt hold much appeal unless your herd is shrinking or dying, or youre desperate for cash.


Even Tsetserleg is only a blip, quickly swallowed up by the smooth slopes of the central steppes Khangai Mountains. Cresting a pass in the hills, we see the two gers where Gaajs family lives in a valley, but nothing else. No power lines, no hum of traffic, not even another familys camp breaks the isolation of the valley as far as the eye can see. Yet somehow when we duck through the tents tiny wooden door we find Gaajs family sprawled around a color TV watching a screening of 3:10 to Yuma (the more recent Russell Crowe version) broadcast with Mongol subtitles from a station back in Ulaanbaatar.

For all their isolation, Gaajs family lives on the grid, connected to broadcast waves and cell signals by the trusty solar panel tilted up on a post between the gers. Gaaj, a thirtysomething man with a hoof-shaped indentation on his face (almost certainly from a horse, but misplaced politeness keeps me from asking outright) and skin so weathered he looks closer to 50, is an entrepreneurial nomad. He has a car that he uses to run a rural taxi service for other nomads, and hes the go-to host for foreigners passing through Arkhangai. Though hardly rich, even by Mongolian standards, he makes a bit more than the $3,780 average annual salary reported by goat, sheep, and yak herders in a 2010 study of nomad incomes in eastern Mongolia.


But his modest wealth didnt buy him his solar panel, nor is he unique in having one. Gaaj is one of the beneficiaries of the Mongolian governments National 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification Program.


Before I left Ulaanbaatar, I overheard a guide named Bold tell two older tourists, You can charge your phone in the gers, adding, The gers all have these panels now.



We save on candles, we can finish our daily tasks without having to postpone them, and we can sell our meat at a higher price because we have better access to information thanks to our TV and phone.
A nomad from the Khentii province



The project began in 2000, just as Mongolias boom years were kicking off following the discovery of some of the worlds largest untapped coal, copper, gold, and uranium deposits. These new resources revolutionized the economy of a nation that had until then survived mainly on cashmere and dairy. The wealth generated by mining developmentsthe Gobi Deserts Oyu Tolgoi mine alone, built in 2010, is set to boost the national economy by one-third within a decadecreated an inexorable nomadic moth-to-the-light process of mass urbanization. (In 2000, Ulaanbaatar was just 61 percent of its current size.)


While Ulaanbaatars skyline is dominated by construction cranes and newly minted skyscrapers, its fringes are made of nomadic gers fixed in place. Drawn in by a sense of missing out on wealth and development (nomadic salaries are still only 65 percent of the national average, and far lower than those of the rising Ulaanbaatar middle class), nomads feel compelled to abandon their lives to become a part of the nations development. Most end up living in slums, working as menial laborers. 


The government of Mongolia was keenly aware of its rural residents predicament, write World Bank energy specialist Peter Johansen and consultants Ivy Cheng and Roberto La Rocca in a 2014 review of the project, and was committed to bring about development  while preserving the herders traditional lifestyle.

The government decided that the best way to do this would be to get solar panels in as many homes as possible. In the early years, the program looked like a failure. Limited in its capacity over such a massive area, the central government could only distribute and repair systems out of the capital. Plus, even with subsidies, the smallest wattage setup still cost about a years salary for an average nomad while the largest capacity cost two years wages. In 2006, six years into the project, theyd only managed to unevenly distribute 33,000 systems. Then, in 2008, international donors stepped in, led by the World Bank, and for once actually delivered as promised.


The project was flooded with $12 million in grants from the World Bank, the International Development Agency, and the Dutch government, a surprisingly proactive ally of the Mongols who also helped to reintroduce a population of wild Przewalski (Takhi in Mongol) horses to the country. The cash boosted the subsidies, slicing prices in half, and helped with the logistics of trucking panels out to the most remote corners of the country.




Another crucial contribution came from XacBank, a local Mongolian microcredit union and the first business to operate branches in every small region and village of the nation. Leveraging relationships between nomads and their local soums (the nearest market or village), the bank built on word of mouth and casual relationships to create local networks of credit providers, advice givers, and servicers to follow up on loans. Following in Xacs footsteps, the World Bank managed to move the panels beyond Ulaanbaatar, setting up local sales shops and training 400 businesspeople in maintenance and service in about 50 locations spread evenly across the physical expanse of the nation. In short, they cut the costs and distance, created a warranty and service network, and started a cascade of positive word of mouth nationwide.


In 2008, when the World Bank launched its new network, almost everyone had given up on the governments original 100,000 ger goal. At best, officials hoped, they would get to 80,000. Instead at the programs close in 2012, just four years later, theyd distributed 100,146 solar panels serving 70 percent of all nomads in the country. And emboldened bureaucrats now hope to achieve universal rural electrification through solar power by 2020.


Before the program, about 90 percent of nomads relied on candles, coal, and yak dung to light and heat their homes, shelling out more than the cost of a solar panel in the space of a few years for smoky and inefficient power. Just over half managed to power a phone or radio with a diesel generator or motorcycle battery, draining more of their meager budgets. In cutting down on energy costs and increasing availability, the solar panel program freed up cash, creating a brand new industry of small appliance providers in the countryside. The industry is so robust that now 70 percent of nomads have a color TV and satellite dish and 90 percent are hooked into a mobile phone network.



  The authors friend Mike standing by Gaajs ger with its solar panel and satellite dish. Courtesy of Mitch Moxley


 

Those mobile phones and televisions, in turn, have hooked nomads for the first time into the information superhighway. Gaaj now has access to weather reports and makes phone calls to markets to manage his livestock, keeping more animals alive and fetching a higher price for their wool, milk, and meat. His phone allows him to stay connected with young family members attending boarding school in the towns and to seek out medical advice from distant clinics.


Of course, there are still some limitations. On a visit to one of Gaajs relatives, a young woman slips out of the ger for several hours. Gaaj later tells me through a translator, She wanted to use her phone, but there is no signal here. She rides to the top of the mountain every day to speak to our family. Its an hours trek up the mountain, but before she got the phone she was often out of touch with relatives for weeks or months at a time. The phone has, to a large extent, replaced the need to embark on often long and arduous journeys just to deliver or pick up a message, write Chung, Johansen, and La Rocca. 


We save on candles, we can finish our daily tasks without having to postpone them, and we can sell our meat at a higher price because we have better access to information thanks to our TV and phone, a nomad from the Khentii province told World Bank consultants in an in-depth interview. If somebody shows up at the ger, we can check the market price now. Before [the panels], we used to accept whatever figure the other person would suggest. These little things add up into an infinitely more secure, connected, and profitable lifestyle.


According to figures from the World Bank and the Mongolian government, nine out of 10 panels purchased more than six years ago, before the warranty and repair program kicked in, were still working, and more than 90 percent of those surveyed found the current reliable and sufficient. Seventy percent of customers reported increased productivity and leisure time, with most families staying up an extra one to two hours to relax and unwind by lamplight.



  The inside of a ger in Mongolia. Courtesy of Mitch Moxley


 

Perhaps we spend more time working at night, but the real impact is that we now carry out our work in a relaxed manner. We dont have to rush to get things done before it is dark anymore, a nomad from Kentii told the surveyors. Ninety-three percent said they were overall satisfied with their panels, and 100 percent said they had or would recommend them to anyone who asked.


There have even been reports in recent years of nomads who had moved to the soums and capital for work moving back to the countryside after hearing how much easier its become to hack it as a herder.


Granted, Gaajs life is still no idyll. One morning, he stands outside the ger as clouds roll in and a wind cuts through the hills. A man of few and exact words, he rubs his hands, stamps his feet, then shakes his head and just says, Cold  very cold. Temperatures in his valley sink to -22 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and if anything goes truly wrong, even if he can call a hospital, getting there in a nation three times the size of France with only one major paved highway a bumpy 30-minute drive away is a daunting prospect.


Many nomads believe that the power of mines, 90 percent of the national economy today, allows mineral extractors and developers to flout laws protecting the forests, water reservoirs, and grazing grounds vital to nomads from degradation.


The sense of encroachment made national heroes out of four nomads who, in 2010, opened fire with their old hunting rifles on an empty mining camp and, the next year, organized a 100-man horseback demonstration in Ulaanbaatar, firing arrows at the Government House. In 2013 President Tsakhia Elbegdorj won his second term on a platform of tighter foreign mining controls. And even with these boosts to the rural economy, more than 800,000 Mongols, many of them nomads, still live below the national poverty line.


Their way of life is under threat, and they have not achieved parity with their urban kin. Some contend that these forces are breeding a nascent anti-mining, pro-traditionalist eco-terror movement. Tsetsegee Munkhbayar, one of those who fired on the mines, and his Gal Undesten movement now stand accused of planting bombs outside government buildings in 2013. We are a small group of simple herders fighting powerful people, Munkhbayar told a New Zealand journalist in 2011. Its not an easy fight but we cannot stand by idly and watch our land and way of life come to an end.


But Gaaj is a savvy and entrepreneurial man. He has the tools to utilize his wits and to sustain his family without just scraping by now. The flimsy tinfoil-looking contraption outside his ger is enough of a lifeline to stand on and fight from, and thats worth something out in the brutal emptiness of the steppe.

Slate,L,Sony Pictures hack: Reveals gender pay gap at the entertainment company and Deloitte. ,"The massive Sony Pictures hackby who? North Korea? A disgruntled employee?has revealed a lot of intimate detail about the people who work at Sony. Reporters whove combed through the compromised internal documents say they include social security numbers, passwords, medical records, disciplinary files, and, inexplicably, the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive. And, because salary data was also breached, we now know for a fact something we assume about most major American companies: The women who work at Sony are being paid less than the men.

Over at Fusion, Kevin Roose has been parsing the numbers. According to a spreadsheet listing the salaries of 6,000 employees, which Roose cautioned had not been confirmed by Sony, 17 U.S. employees are making $1 million or more. Only one of those is a woman. Roose followed up with a piece looking at the salaries of co-presidents of production at Sonys Columbia Pictures division, Michael De Luca and Hannah Minghella. They have the same job andoh dear, this is awkwardhes making close to a million dollars more.


    Advertisement




Earlier this year, after they started their partnership, De Luca and Minghella were asked by the Wrap: Is there any tension between you two now that Mike is sharing the same title as Hannah? Just sexual tension, De Luca joked. Ha! Now there might be more.


Meanwhile, somehow the Sony hack also accessed internal documents from consulting firm Deloitte, which were on a Sony computer. And guess what? Youre never gonna guess. A Deloitte salary spreadsheet from 2005 reveals that 85 of the top 100 earners there were men. In fairness, the document appears to have been put together to understand if there was racial or gender-based compensation discrimination within the company, Roose writes. I guess they got their answer. (Deloitte wouldnt confirm the data.)


This has been a crappy week for women in the workplace. In oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices seemed skeptical that companies are obliged to offer pregnant employees a modicum of flexibility, so that they dont have to choose between lifting heavy packages and compromising their pregnancies, or losing their jobs. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Valleywag reported that a 41-year-old mother had also filed a lawsuit against the online real estate company Zillow, claiming, among other things, that she had been badgered for being too old to close. And earlier in the week, the Recorder broke the news of another lawsuit against Zillow, this one by a former female employee describing a frat-like atmosphere of sexual harassment at the company. Rachel Kremer alleges that an IT employee said hed reset her password in exchange for boob pix, that her supervisor sent her a photo of his penis, and so much more. Much of this egregious behavior was over email and text, so Kremer was able to provide evidence of the harassment in the lawsuit (including the lovely penis photo). Its not clear whats more astonishing: the outrageousness of the male Zillow employees or their sheer idiocy in creating a digital paper trail.


Speaking of digital trails, more details about life at Sony may emerge in coming days. But for now, theres this script for a recruiting video, properly described as cheesy, in which an HR executive refers to how great it is to work at Sony Pictures Entertainment. A more honest video might add, but its better if youre a man.

Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.

Answer by Thomas Snerdley:


    Advertisement




The reason Gandalf frequently used a sword was not because he was a Maiar spirit, but because he was an Istar.


Around the year 1000 of the Third Age, the Council of the Valar chose an unknown number of Maiar spirits to oppose Sauron in Middle-earth. The five whom Tolkien namesCurumo/Saruman, Aiwendil/Radagast, Olrin/Gandalf, Alatar/Morinehtar, and Pallando/Rmestmoas ""chiefs"" of their order formed the Heren Istarion, or ""Order of Wizards."" Each individual member was known as an Istar (Quenya: ""wizard""); the plural form was Istari.


The Council of the Valar imposed two significant limitations upon the Istari that eventually contributed to the reason that Gandalf used a sword:First, the Istari were ""forbidden to reveal themselves in forms of majesty, or to seek to rule the wills of Men or Elves by open display of power.""Second, the Istari's Maiar spirits were""clad in bodies as of Men, real and not feigned, but subject to the fears and pains and weariness of earth, able to hunger and thirst and be slain; though because of their noble spirits they did not die, and aged only by the cares and labours of many long years.""


Additionally, the Istari wanted to conceal their divine origins from Sauron in order to avoid attracting his malevolent attention. So they carried wooden staffs (also referred to as ""wands"" and ""rods"") that they used as camouflage on the rare instances when they exerted Maiar power in the form of casting ""spells."" This may have helped the Istari, at least for a while, blend in with other human ""sorcerors"" in Middle-earth.


As it turned out, encasing Maiar spirits in mortal bodies proved to be a dual strategy for the Valar.


On the one hand, Gandalf was able to enjoy the sight and sound of fireworks, to luxuriate in the nicotine rush of smoking pipe-weed, to use his mortal hands to fashion magical and mundane artifacts like fireworks and the Old Took's self-fastening diamond studs. But like the other Istari, Gandalf also came to understand the limitations and temptations of weak, mortal flesh.


Gone was Gandalf's innate Maiar ability to seamlessly change forms as he once did in Valinor, where he inspired the hearts of the elves. Now he had to fear being slain by the servants of evil.


For several millennia, while Sauron laid low after his defeat by Elendil and Gil-galad, that wasn't a big deal. But things began to get downright hazardous when Sauron rebuilt his power at Dol Guldur. Gandalf had a very narrow escape from Sauron's dungeons ... this probably awoke in him the realization of his mortal body's lethal vulnerability.

So Gandalf did what you or I or anyone else in a similar perilous position might do: He weaponed up and got himself a sword.


But not just any sword. Ganadalf came into possession of the ancient elvish blade Glamdring (Sindarin: ""Foe-hammer""). Befiting the sword of Turgon of Gondolin, High King of the Elves of Middle-earth, Glamdring was a white and goldsword that ""shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand"" and had a beautiful ruel-bone (ivory) scabbard and a jeweled hilt.


And it's a darn good thing Gandalf had Glamdring at the Bridge of Khazad-dm because the Balrog of Morgoth was carrying a giant sword with which he tried to kill him:


... still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm. 


From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.


Glamdring glittered white in answer.


There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back, and its sword flew up in molten fragments.



Bearing Glamdring, Gandalf slew numerous minions of evil, including the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains, while concealing his Maiar nature.

Slate,L,Akai Gurley shooter Peter Liang texted union before requesting help.,"New York City officer Peter Liang and his partner texted their union representative before calling for help over their radios after Liang fatally shot Akai Gurley in a housing project stairwell on Nov. 20, the New York Daily News reports.

In the critical moments after the Nov. 20 shooting, the cops commanding officer and an emergency operator  responding to a 911 call from a neighbor and knowing the duo was in the area  tried to reach them in vain, sources said.


Thats showing negligence, said a law enforcement source of the pairs decision to text their union rep before making a radio call for help.

Police commissioner Bill Bratton has said Liang's gun went off accidentally in the stairwell, which did not have functioning lights. The New York Post has reported that Liang was violating protocol by keeping his finger on the weapon's trigger.

The invitation-only site was launched by graphic designers Agusti Juste and Eva Calduch, longtime home exchangers who were tired of wading through the dregs of cluttered home swap sites and decided to create a space to connect like-minded people with a similar love of tasteful things and interest in a more enriching travel experience.

They assembled a collection of thoughtfully designed homes that belong to designers, architects, art directors, artists, stylists, photographers, and other design and art professionals who are interested in home swaps with fellow aesthetes and creatives.

Behomm stands out from the crowd of generic exchange sites by focusing on just designers and visual artists, reads a press release. They emphasize that the site focuses on beautiful homes of all shapes and sizes in urban, beach, and rural locales around the world. The founders firmly believe that beauty and aesthetics are not tied to luxury. In fact, they personally get very happy when a small and beautiful home registers!

The founders sent me an invitation to browse through the listings. The site design is clean and streamlined, and you can search based on location, number of people traveling, whether pets or children are allowed, and other criteria. The photos tend to be high quality, and there are plenty of good-looking spaces full of style and personality. But some of the listings don't include photos, which seems nonsensical for a site that focuses on the aesthetics of the homes. (Behomm's Shizuko Ono told me in an email that photos are now required for new members.) Also, information listing the features of each home and information about members is often sparse, meaning you might have to spend time corresponding with members to answer specific questions about potential swaps.

Slate,L,Family Life by Akhil Sharma: Slate Whiting Second Novel List title.,"Great moments in literary compression:

In 1911, Ezra Pound attempts to capture a vision he had one day while exiting a Paris subway station. He junks that 71-line poem, deeming it a work of the second intensity, which is apparently some sort of Modernist insult that we should immediately bring back into common use. Pound has another go at it six months later, this time using 30 lines, and fails again. He fiddles and whittles, and the next year he produces In a Station of the Metro, a majestic two-line sentence: The apparition of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough. Damn, bro.



 


 

In 2001 or so, Akhil Sharma starts the project that will become Family Life. He writes, deletes, and rewrites more than 7,000 pages, second intensity stuff that makes him question if it was the right investment of [his] time. Friends urge him to abandon the novel; he fiddles and whittles and feels ashamed. The final version that was published this spring, the fifth of our five selections for the Slate/Whiting Second Novel List, is a slim 224 pages. As Sharma wrote in The New Yorker, The book does everything I would want a book to do. I just wish twelve and half years of my life hadnt gone into creating it.

Who among us does not know the agony of trying to get it right, whether were Imagistic poets, supremely talented second novelists, or assistant managers trying to decide whether to include our Pomeranian-Lab mixes in our Things Im Thankful For Facebook status updates? Is the final result worth all the wrong turns, the dead words, the torture? Akhil Sharma has suffered for your pleasure, and the results are magnificent. He suffered in his youth, as his novel takes off from his family history, and he suffered anew as he wrestled mightily, in heroic scale, with that essential writers dilemma: trying to get the words right. And trying. And trying. Eventually, he pulled it off.

So heres to false starts, and to all the brilliant solutions. Sharmas second novel details the Mishra familys emigration from Delhi to New York City in the late 70s, and their undoing once oldest son, Birju, has a horrible swimming accident. The resulting brain damage leaves the boy in need of expensive, round-the-clock care. Dad, who scraped up the money to bring his family to the U.S. for a new life, takes to drink, and Mom loses herself in her obsession over her sons doomed rehabilitation. That leaves Ajay, the youngest son, who travels in circles, narrating his attempts to crack the inscrutable codes of adolescence and Americaness, and his own savage, unruly self.


This is tragedy. If you have no acquaintance with this kind of misfortune, it will make you count your blessings, even as you marvel at the mesmerizing economy of Sharmas sentences. If you are unfortunate enough to recognize some of the pain here, Sharmas deft portraiture will send you shivering, and make you thankful for an artist who speaks for your unexpressed notions.




But if its tragedy, why do I remember the jokes with such fondness? My father loved science, Ajay tells us. The way he tried to bring it into his life was by going to medical clinics and having his urine tested. Most reviews of Family Life have adequately conveyed its harrowing cruelties. But since this Slate/Whiting project is intended to steer readers toward second novels they may have overlooked, Id like to point out that beyond the sadness, the novel contains a deep, nourishing reservoir of grim humor, thanks to Ajays deadpan and dead-eyed perceptions. Hes an invariably unnerving narrator, whether decoding the true meaning of Its a Wonderful Life (To me, the movie meant that if you become unhappy enough, almost anything can pass as happiness) or trying to arouse sympathy in his bored classmates by devising cringe-worthy stories of Birjus pre-accident powers (My brother was a very fast runner. Once, he threw a ball straight ahead of him, and he chased it and caught it before it hit the ground). There are plenty of cross-cultural miscommunications in Family Life, but gallows humor needs no translation.


All that said, even though Akhil Sharma has pulled off an admirable feat with this book, I hope he has an easier time with Novel No. 3. For his sake. A person can only take so much.

Slate,L,Mark Wahlberg pardon request: Actor was convicted of assault at age 16.,"Mark Wahlberg has applied to be pardoned for his 1988 assault conviction, New England network NECN reports. The actor was 16 years old and attempting to steal beer outside a convenience store in Dorchester, Mass. when he hit one man with a stick and punched another. The man who he hit with the stick was reportedly left blind in one eye; Wahlberg was tried as an adult and served 45 days in prison. From NECN:

In making his case, Wahlberg cites his involvement with charities and good deeds he has done to rebuild his life, including the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, the Dorchester Boys and Girls Club, the renovation of the Boston-area Parish Gym and the fact that he attends church nearly every day.


""I have not engaged in philanthropic efforts in order to make people forget about my past,"" added Wahlberg. ""To the contrary, I want people to remember my past so that I can serve as an example of how lives can be turned around and how people can be redeemed.""

NECN says the application will take at least until the new year to make its way through Massachusetts' board of pardons to the state's governor, who at that point will be Republican Charlie Baker. It would then have to be approved by the state's ""governor's council.""

Slate,L,"Rumain Brisbon shooting, Phoenix protests: Unarmed black man and white cop.","Phoenix was the site of protests on Wednesday night following the death of Rumain Brisbon, a 34-year-old man shot and killed by police one day earlier. Echoing a bigger national conversation about race and use of force by law enforcement, one local activist expressed growing frustration with a perceived tendency of police to shoot rather than arrest and detain, telling USA Today, ""It's open season for killing black men."" Friendscalled Brisbon""a gentle father of four who was dropping off fast food for his kids at his family's apartment.""

According to a statement from a spokesman for the Phoenix police department, the officerwhose name has not yet been releasedwas near Brisbon's apartment complex investigating a burglary when a man who lived there told him a drug deal was taking place in a nearby Cadillac SUV. The officer allegedly saw Brisbon take something from the back of the car and put his hands in his waistband when the officer went to talk to him. The officer drew his weapon and Brisbon then ran towards his girlfriend's apartment, the police spokesman said. The two struggled inside the building, according to the police account, Brisbon refusing to get on the ground and ""verbally challenging"" the officer, who thought he felt the handle of a gun in Brisbon's pocket (it was actually a bottle of oxycodone pills). The two fell into an apartment when a woman opened her door, and the officer then shot Brisbon twice in the torso, killing him. The officer is unharmed. From USA Today:

Brandon Dickerson, who said he was in the car with Brisbon shortly before the shooting and witnessed some of the incident, said Brisbon was dropping off fast food to his children in the apartment. On Wednesday evening, strewn french fries still littered the front porch.


Dickerson said he never saw the officer try to talk with Brisbon. He also said his friend wasn't yelling at the officer.""Who's gonna argue with police?"" Dickerson said. ""He had no death wish yesterday.""


USA Today notes that Brisbon had a minor drug violation on his record and has been shot before while serving a 5-year probation sentence for a 1998 burglary conviction, with court records noting he was on a ""self destructive path due to his emotional state"" following that shooting.


The police department said it would not name the officer, who has seven years of experience on the force, but that he was doing what was expected of him. Protestors are calling for the release of the officer's name. It's been a troubled year for the Phoenix police department. Back in August, an independent investigation was launched after Phoenix police shot and killedMichelle Cusseaux, a mentally ill 50-year-old woman. The officer was trying to serve the woman a court order to take her to a mental health facility.

Slate,L,Kilgore College: Texas community college asbestos controversy escalates to shooting at board members house. ,"This article originally appeared in Inside Higher Ed.

A bullet through the front door and into the living room of a Texas community college board member's house may be the most dramatic in a series of recent controversies at Kilgore College.


Besides the bullet, there have also beensecret tape recordings, accusations of unethical land deals, and allegations that improper handling ofasbestos allowed the cancer-causingmaterial into the air on campus.


    Advertisement




Leaders at Kilgore, a 5,800-student community college in Texas Piney Woods, have been in a back-and-forth over policy, procedure, and each others characters for many months now. On one side are two members of the Kilgore Board of Trustees who are adamant that other trustees on the nine-member board are giving safe harbor to a dysfunctional administration.


Their latest criticism involves asbestos in college buildings. The college facilities director, Dalton Smith,told theLongview News-Journalin recent days about what he called cover-ups and improper asbestos abatements at the college. Smith said another college official tried to remove asbestos by himself from an auditorium this springjust days before a public performance by theKilgore Rangerettes, the college's famous drill team, which performs topacked audiences across the world.



Itsunclear who fired the shot or why, but Nutt believes its related to his criticism of others at Kilgore.



Smith alsosecretly recorded conversations with Dan Beach, Kilgores director of special projects and the administrations liaison to the board. In those recordings, which were obtained by the local newspaper, Beach said that tofigure out who might have been exposed to asbestos on campus, the college would have to print a list of every student thats been here for the last 30 years.


On the other side of the dispute is long-serving President Bill Holda and his administration. Defenders suggest that his outspoken critics on the boardwho are in the minority when it comes time to vote on anythingare trying to micromanage the college and specifically trying to oust Holda by publicly embarrassing him and his administration.


For one of those critics, Kilgore trustee Rev. Brian Nutt, theres a bullet through his door. It was fired shortly after the recent revelations about asbestos. Nutt, who is also a local pastor, has been an outspoken critic of the administration. Itsunclear who fired the shot or why, but Nutt believes its related to his criticism of others at Kilgore.


You hate to make assumptions, but I dont believe in coincidences that often,"" Nutt said.""And when it happens the night after this huge story comes out in the paper, with audio recordings that go against all of their denialsit has to be tied.""


Nutt believes he was also the target of veiled threats back in early September. Thats when the incoming chairman of the board defended the outgoing chairman, Charlie Hale, against criticism about a land deal Halehad with Holdas wife. Hale had sold a piece of property to Kilgore College Holdas wife around the time Hale was joining the board in spring 2008.


Nutt and his fellow outspoken board member, Carlos Scooter Griffin, questioned the deal. Griffin suggested the deal was not fully disclosed to the board. At the board meeting, in early September, the then-interim board Chairman James Walker, defended Hale and directed what some considered a veiled threat at Nutt. Charlie, Walker said, was a man that spent over 20 years in the armed service, highly decorated. He fought in Vietnam and he fought in Iraq, was honorably discharged, came home and was, I think, harassed. And I hope his fellow veterans take note of that, particularly the veterans that live here in Kilgore. At the time, Griffin said he felt Walker was soliciting ill will and harm. Walker said those words while looking straight at Reverend Nutt, Griffin said in an email at the time.


Over the course of several months, Kilgore representatives did not return messages seeking comment, even thoseseeking responses on allegationsrelated to perceivedthreats against a trustee. Last week, college spokesman Chris Craddock said the university was declining to comment on a series of questions that he called obviously biased and agenda-driven and based on information from sources who are very biased against the college administration. The college did release a statement from Holda about the asbestos allegations. I have no evidence from any source that would corroborate any of these allegations, Holda said. Neither Dalton Smith, KCs Coordinator of Physical Plant nor any federal investigators have contacted me with specific allegations nor details. Nutt said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Environmental Protection Agency were both investigating theasbestos-related allegations.




As part of the presidentsannual evaluation this year, Holda, who has been at Kilgore for 39 years, including nearly 19 as president, said 2013 had been one of his most challenging years.


I have found that a number of board-related issues, as well as a lack of board unity and synchronicity, has been a distraction that has prevented me from focusing on some of the big issues for Kilgore College, Holda wrote in the self-evaluation he did for the board in January. In Texas, board members are elected and serve six-year terms, although members can also be appointed to boards for unexpired terms and, in a relatively unusual electoral practice, sittingboard membersnames do not appear on the ballot, and they are given another term if nobody files to run against them. The entire boards own overallrating of the president dropped from a 4.7 on a 5-point scale to a 3.8.


Griffins comments in the evaluation were expansive and blunt. He said Holda was the best president Kilgore had ever hadbut it was time for Holda to retire. The boards governance, Griffin wrote to Holda, is severely weakened by your design. Holdas critics, for instance, noted that a recent opening on the board was filled by a longtime assistant to Holda.


For their part, the board members seem to be styling themselves after another activist college board member in Texas,Wallace Hall, of the University of Texas System. Hall has sharply questioned the management of thatsystems flagship campus in Austin and attempted to investigate it, sometimes on his own. A state legislative panel voted to censure Hall for what critics calledhis rogue actions. Others view Hallas something of a hero. At Kilgore, board member Griffin has spoken admiringly of Hall. In one email this fall, Griffin said, Thegoverning board must cease serving the administrator and instead serve the institution.


Walker, the chairman of the Kilgore board, apparently has adifferent philosophy.During a board meeting this fall, he said, It is not our job to try to drive the bus. It is our job to kick the damn tiresor kick the bus driver.


Griffin and Nutt, along with a concerned citizen named Tommy Konczak who has been showing up to board meetings and filing public records request for college documents, question whether the board is doing enough kicking.


Were in decline, Griffin said. Weve got entrenched management thereadministrationtheyre going to do it their way, hell or high water, and it may not make very good business sense, but theyve got enough votes on the board to rubber-stamp.


Rey Garcia, the president of the Texas Association of Community College, said a few community college boards in the state now have activist board members who have read about Wallace Hall and model their behavior after his.


I think youve got a case where you have some board members who might be getting into issues of micromanagement that are beyond typical boardmanship and governance questions, said Garcia.


The association is a voluntary groupof the states 50 community colleges. Holda is a past president of the associations board, asign of his standing in the Texas community college world because its a position to which he was elected by his peers.


Garcia said he wasnt sure about the land deals or asbestos, but hed heard that some of the outspoken Kilgore board members had been questioning accounting procedures and election practices that are firmly rooted intradition or state law. At one point, he said some Kilgore board members had been talking about hiring their own attorney for the board, instead of using the advice of the college's own attorney. Thats unusual, Garcia said, because the board is the college.


This is obviously a case where you have a good deal of discord among the board members themselves and I think the administration, in some ways, is stuck in the middle, he said.


At times, the questioning has gotten personal, like when critics raise questions about Holdas wife's land deals with Hale, the former board chairman. Tommy Konczak, the local businessman who has taken an interest in Kilgore, noted that Beachthe college official who was secretly recorded talking about asbestos  had also done a land deal with President Holdas wife. While none of this involves college money, it does raise questions about their relationship outside work and how it might affect the college's management.

In an unrelated episode, according to public documents Konczakobtained, the Texas Rangers investigated allegations of malfeasance, theft and improper relationships at Kilgore several years ago. They gave their findings to a county prosecutor who then declined to prosecute the case for lack of evidence.


The asbestos whistleblower, Dalton Smith, said in a brief telephone call lastweek that he didnt want to give another interview, citing the shot fired at Nutts house.

Slate,L,Fraternity sexual assault and criminal activities: States should use gang laws to seize their assets.,"Last month, the University of Virginia suspended all fraternity activities in response to allegations of rapes at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. In September, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, suspended Tau Kappa Epsilon while police investigated claims that brothers had drugged women at a party and marked the hands of their victims with red Xs to indicate their vulnerability. The University of Texas at Arlington Sigma Phi Epsilon house was closed down after three reported sexual assaults this summer. Delta Kappa Epsilons Yale chapter is in its fourth year of a five-year suspension that followed an episode in which pledges paraded through a residential quad chanting, No means yes; yes means anal.

While the problem of campus sexual assault is complex, one thing is clear: Some fraternity chapterscall them rogue chaptersare operating so far outside the boundaries of acceptable behavior that they pose an active threat to university communities. They control spaces that students warn their friends not visit alone on a Friday night. They are repeat offenders that foster a culture of permissiveness toward sexual violence.


Law enforcement officials have an unutilized tool at their disposal to combat rogue fraternities: They can treat these organizations as criminal street gangs under state law and seize their assets.


    Advertisement




While treating frats like gangs might seem a strange way to frame the issue, consider the law in my home state, Virginia. Rogue chapters would easily meet the Virginia Codes three criteria for a criminal street gang. Such a group must have as one of its primary objectives or activities the commission of one or more criminal activities. Second, it must have an identifiable name or identifying sign or symbol. And, third, its members must have individually or collectively engaged in the commission of  two or more predicate criminal acts, at least one of which is an act of violence.



Sweatshirts are emblazoned with Greek letters that pick out members of different fraternities as surely as gang colors.



With respect to the first element, its abundantly clear to even a casual observer of Greek life that one of the primary activities of many fraternities is illegally supplying alcohol to minors. I live on the University of Virginia grounds, and each weekend I can watch from my front porch as the waves of humanity roll down from the first-year dorms and crash on Frat Rowrather than bars, where a state crackdown has made it harder for underage students to pass off their fake IDs. The outsize role fraternities play in the social life of universities is staked, in part, on their ability to provide social spaces that enable underage drinking far from the scrutiny of university administrators or law enforcement. Rogue chapters use their control over provision of alcohol to minors as leverage, enabling members to prey on vulnerable young women.


The second element, identifiable signs or symbols, is easily satisfied. Not only do fraternities have clearly identifiable names, but college campuses are blanketed by sweatshirts and ball caps emblazoned with distinctive Greek letters that pick out members of different fraternities as surely as gang colors. Members of Greek organizations sometimes even display hand signals that the uninitiated can confuse for gang signs (especially when the appearance of the person signing better fits their preconceived image of a gang member).


A fraternity chapter whose members have engaged in multiple acts of sexual assault would also satisfy the final criterion, criminal acts of violence. In the 1980s and 90s, states faced a rising tide of gang violence. Anti-gang statutes were implemented to give law enforcement officials tools to deal with groups where criminal prosecutions were hindered by entrenched cultures of silence and witness intimidation. Prosecutions of sexual assaults committed by members of rogue fraternities face similar challenges. Bonds of personal and institutional loyalty discourage cooperation or reporting by members of the fraternity, and the uniquely stigmatizing character of sexual violence discourages victims from pressing charges.


If a fraternity satisfies the definition of a criminal street gang, the state of Virginia can seize any real property used in substantial connection with its criminal acts or recruitment activities. Fraternity houses serve an important role in the criminal activities of rogue fraternity chapters. They insulate the chapter from supervision and oversight. They function as the venue for flagrantly flouting state laws relating to underage drinking, supplying alcohol to minors, and, in the context of rushing and pledging, hazing and recruitment. They also serve as vehicles for systematically subjecting women to sexual assault. The state has a powerful tool to disrupt the activities of groups whose egregious misconduct makes them closer in spirit to organized criminal enterprises than student clubs. It can take their fraternity houses.


Asset forfeiture has certain advantages relative to criminal prosecutions. First, an action of this kind highlights the dimension of collective responsibility involved in an organization where the culture has become pervasively toxic. Criminal prosecutions on their own can allow the group to cast the accused as isolated bad apples. Seizing a fraternitys house emphasizes the institutional character of the problem. Moreover, as a civil action, the commonwealth would only need to prove its case by preponderance of the evidencea more likely than not standard. By contrast, criminal prosecution is held to the higher beyond reasonable doubt standard.


Last, seizing the house also immediately benefits the community by removing the danger posed by a rogue fraternity chapters activities from the colleges social universe. Its worth noting that Virginia law recognizes the broad community interest in stopping houses from being used for gang activities. Any responsible citizen of the state can file suit to declare a house used for such activities a nuisance and force its closure. A responsible state would take on the job itself.

Slate,L,"Edward Banfield: The racist, classist origins of broken windows policing.","Broken windows policing is back in New York City, and it may have killed Eric Garner. Broken windows is an order-maintenance strategy that encourages cops to enforce quality-of-life laws on the grounds that, essentially, nits breed lice. It presumes that a disorderly environment where small laws are broken with impunity leads to bigger problems. This is the mindset that led the police to approach Garner for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes: loose cigarettes today, civil unrest tomorrow.

Though NYPD Commissioner William Bratton is a big proponent of broken windows policing, theres no evidence that the policy is effective in reducing violent crime. At the same time, the effects of order-maintenance policing are felt disproportionately by members of minority groups. In August, responding to critics claims that these policies unfairly target people of color, Bratton told the Associated Press that it's not an intentional focus on minorities. It's a focus on behavior. Bratton added, We are not a racist organizationnot at all.


Maybe Bratton is right. But even if broken windows isn't explicitly racist, it's inherently classist, and the two are close enough as to be functionally indistinguishable.


    Advertisement




The broken windows theory was first articulated in a 1982 Atlantic article by George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson, who argued that disorder and crime are usually inextricably linked, in a kind of developmental sequence. That idea is rooted in the work of a midcentury political scientist named Edward Banfield. (Wilson studied under Banfield at the University of Chicago.) Banfield specialized in refuting the main tenet of modern liberalism, the idea that the state should take an active role in improving the lives of its most vulnerable residents. Banfield contended that state intervention could only make things worse.


In his 1970 book The Unheavenly City and a revised edition titled The Unheavenly City Revisited, Banfield addressed the eras so-called urban crisis: high crime rates, riots, white flight. Liberalism was to blame, Banfield arguedor, at the very least, liberal policies would never help fix the crisis. The Great Society initiatives of the Johnson era had just served to widen class divisions and to encourage members of the lower classes to blame others for their plight, thus fostering feelings of resentment and entitlement.



The idea that lower-class men are inherently dangerous and untrustworthy is at the root of broken windows policing.



Banfield argued that class divisions were based less on finances than on ones life outlook and capacity for long-range thought. Members of the upper class were future-oriented, and, thus, able to postpone short-term pleasures for longer-term rewards. Members of the lower classesurban blacks, in large partlived from moment to moment, and acted out of a desire for instant gratification. They were also unambitious, radically improvident, antisocial, and prone to mental illness. Their problems were a matter of pathology, not racial prejudice (which Banfield argued was on the wane).


The implication that lower-class culture is pathological seems fully warranted, said Banfield. Thus, he argued, rather than waste time and public money implementing policies based on the false notion that all men were created equal, better to just face facts and acknowledge the natural divisions that exist. Members of the lower classes should leave school in ninth grade, to get a jump on a lifetime of manual labor. The minimum wage should be repealed to encourage employers to create more jobs for low-value labor. The state should give intensive birth-control guidance to the incompetent poor. And the police should feel free to crack down on young lower-class men.




Like many people, Banfield believed the urban unrest of the late 1960s had been stoked by matters of civil rights. But Banfield believed the problem was that the lower classes had too many of them. Criminal behavior was human natureor, rather, in the nature of a specific subset of lower-class humans. So long as there are large concentrations of boys and young men of the lower classes on the streets, rampages and forays are to be expected, Banfield wrote. The clear solution was to remove these lower-class youths from the streets posthaste.

There are individuals whose propensity to crime is so high that no set of incentives that it is feasible to offer to the whole population would influence their behavior, Banfield wrote. The most effective way to prevent violent crime in cities, Banfield theorized, would therefore be to pre-emptively abridge the freedom of the mostly young, lower-class males who were likely to commit crimes in the future. Whats that? You say that abridging the freedom of persons who have not committed crimes is incompatible with the principles of free society? Well, said Banfield, so, also, is the presence in free society of persons who, if their freedom is not abridged, would use it to inflict serious injuries on others.


This is basically the plot of Minority Report and countless other dystopian fictions: empowering law enforcement to arrest or otherwise disappear individuals whose continued freedom threatens the stability of the state. These policies might play well in science fiction or Soviet Russia. But this is America, and, in America, pre-emptive incarceration is a political nonstarter. The principle behind this idea, however, is at the root of broken windows policing: the idea that lower-class men are inherently dangerous and untrustworthy and are likely to commit crimes in the future even if theyre not doing so today. To put it another way, there are times where the essential welfare of individuals must be sacrificed for the good health of society, as Banfield wrote.


In their 1982 Atlantic article, titled Broken Windows, Kelling and Wilson argued that community safety can be negatively affected by a surfeit of disreputable or obstreperous or unpredictable people: panhandlers, drunks, addicts, rowdy teenagers, prostitutes, loiterers, the mentally disturbed. A preponderance of lower-class layabouts makes a neighborhood feel unsafe to its law-abiding residents; these residents hunker down or disassociate or move away, and soon the neighborhood actually becomes unsafe. Better, then, to stop this process before it starts, and to target minor deviant behaviors before they become something worse.


This theory encourages the police to conflate supposed cultural deviance with criminal deviance, to assume that a disreputable or obstreperous demeanor indicates some more destructive pathology. Kelling and Wilson cited the example of one effective Newark, New Jersey, police officer who had the habit of taking informal or extralegal steps to help protect what the neighborhood had decided was the appropriate level of public order. In other words, he targeted those who deviate from behavioral normsnorms that are defined by the dominant social class, of course. And while Banfield insisted that he was not making a racial argumentthat there were lower-class whites as well as lower-class blacksthe fact is that class status correlates to socio-economic status, and urban poverty is minority poverty. No need for code words here: In modern America, lower class basically means black. Disreputable or obstreperous or unpredictablethat also means black.


In their Atlantic article, Kelling and Wilson recognized the racial implications of order policing. How do we ensure, in short, that the police do not become the agents of neighborhood bigotry? they asked, before essentially shrugging and moving on. We can offer no wholly satisfactory answer to this important question. Oh, wellhopefully everything will work itself out.

More than 30 years later, the answer seems clear to me: Broken windows will always become an agent of neighborhood bigotry, because broken windows encourages cops to define lower-class men as basically another species and to make ad hoc cultural judgments the linchpin of crime prevention strategies. This is how looking different transforms into looking dangerous. This is how Eric Garner dies, mumbling I cant breathe, held in a chokehold by a white police officer who works for a department led by a man who believes that if you take care of the little things, then you can prevent a lot of the big things. This is how you get thousands of marchers in the streets of New York City. Loose cigarettes today. Civil unrest tomorrow.

Slate,L,"Rolling Stone gang rape story: Trust in alleged victim ""misplaced,"" mag says.","Since the Nov. 19 publication of Rolling Stone's shocking story about a premeditated gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity house, a number of writers have criticized the magazine and writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely for apparently failing to corroborate information given to them by Jackie, the victim of the alleged rape. (Slate's Double XX Gabfest, on which Erdely appeared, was among the first to raise questions.) Today, a Washington Post report calls key details of the Rolling Stone story into questionand the magazine has published a note indicating that it no longer stands behind its piece:

In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies inJackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion thatour trust in her was misplaced.We were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account. We are taking this seriously and apologize to anyone who was affected by the story.

The Post reports that Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity named in the story as the location of the attack, is preparing to release a statement ""rebutting"" claims made in Rolling Stone:


Officials close to the fraternity said that the statement will indicate that Phi Kappa Psi did not host a party on Sept. 28, 2012, the night that a university student named Jackie alleges she was invited to a date party, lured into an upstairs room and was then ambushed and gang-raped by seven men who were rushing the fraternity.


The officials also said that no members of the fraternity were employed at the universitys Aquatic Fitness Center during that time frame  a detail Jackie provided in her account to Rolling Stone and in interviews with The Washington Post  and that no member of the house matches the description detailed in the Rolling Stone account.


Jackie told the Post she stands by her telling of her story, and reiterated that she was rapedbut also ""acknowledged"" to the paper that some details in the Rolling Stone article ""might not be accurate.""

In New York, Jonathan Chait describes the beginning of the end: Several weeks ago, [TNR CEO Guy] Vidra communicated the new vision to the staff in what I am told was an uncomfortable stream of business clichs ungrounded in any apparent strategy other than saying things like lets break shit and were a tech company now.

What that means: The magazine will relocate to New York City, sharply curtail its print edition while ramping up its online presence, make as-yet-unknown adjustments to staff structure, and in general reimagine itself as a vertically integrated digital media company. Others have unpacked the implications of this conversionthe prevailing attitude seems to be that TNR fell off a horse, but not in an illuminating waybut Id like to return to Vidras buzzy phrase, lets break shit. It belongs to an instantly recognizable lexicon of brands, content, disruption, and the new media landscape. Where did it come from?

People have been breaking shit and talking about it for decades. Used literally, the phrase break shit appears in magazine articles and plays from the 1990s (Cmon, well play college again. Well get loud and break shit, coaxes a character in Gary Rues Painting It Red) and books from the early aughts (Being poor aint fun, dog. Sometimes I just wanna break shit, a working class teenager tells reporter John Jackson in a 2001 history of Harlem.) It had a cameo in the 1970 journal article The Music of Their Laughter, which quotes thirty-two young people on their experiences with and views about drugs, sex, politics, and society. These examples, ancillary as they seem, have a common denominator: youth. Kicking over sandcastles, crashing towers of Legos, totaling your parents carrecklessly going around and breaking shit is kid stuff. So is disaffectedly lashing out and breaking shit. And the swear word just drives home the puerile irreverence of the activity: Were going to overturn convention, and knock down linguistic decorum, too. (Maybe in a staff meeting!)


Before breaking shit became the official sport of Silicon Valley, a place in which utopian idealism and forehead-smacking immaturity often converge, it made a home in punk rock. Henry Rollins, frontman for the hardcore band Black Flag, infamously told an interviewer: When I was 18 I wanted to fuck on the floor and break shit. When I was 25 I wanted to fuck on the floor and break shit. When I was 35 I wanted to fuck on the floor and break shit. Now Im 40 and I want to fuck on the floor and break shit. While Rollins words may have contained a tinge of revolutionary ardor, they are less about the brilliant future than the desperate present. Mostly, they recall the nihilistic anarchy of Mick Jagger painting everything black. Once upon a time, iconoclast novelist/punkish rocker Neal Pollackhe who wipes his ass with your novel, according to Bookslutsaid of the literary establishment, I dont like it. Its boring, its elitist, its pretentious. And I wanna break shit. You got the sense he was not advocating creative destruction so much as destructive destruction. Breaking shit implied transgression with no higher purpose. (Ten years later, a more wistful, sage Pollack said he doesnt want to break things any more.)


Recently, though, the rending of crap got a makeover. It was swept up in Schumpeters gale, a theory of economic progress from the 1950s that saw new businesses constantly rising from the ash of old businesses. The Innovators Dilemma, a 1997 bestseller by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen, spun this ivory tower insight into a catchy movement.* Christensens hypothesis of disruptive innovation put a relentlessly positive spin on novelty, proposing that economies flourish when hungry upstarts usurp established giants for cheap. In this world, you could begin to imagine that the kid stomping on his dads eyeglasses wasnt just being dumb, or enacting some Freudian drama. Maybe he was ushering in the future!


We Break ShitInnovate Fearlessly, reads the title of a 2012 post on iKickStart, a website for the agile entrepreneur. The article takes aim at truisms like if it aint broke dont fix it, arguing that such conservatism is the stuff of innovation anti-patternsparalysisthe loss of all things pragmatic. A year later, the Makers Movement Manifesto told its audience of hackers and crafters to Break Shit. Disrupt Schemes. These days, a congratulatory use of the phrase break shit seems to reflect the Silicon Valley ethos that there are no incremental improvements or careful course corrections. There is only revolution.


Maybe quoting someone who died in 1892 goes against the innovative spirit of breaking shit, but Alfred Lord Tennyson also had thoughts on the cycle of destruction. Break, break, break/ on thy cold gray stones, O Sea, he wrote wearily. The tender grace of a day that is dead/ Will never come back to me. Tennyson means, in the first two lines, that too many breaks have a way of becoming repetitive, old hat. (Thats something that anyone sick of hearing about #disruption can relate to.) But the exodus of retiring TNR editorsnot to mention the staffers who remainmight argue the punch comes at the end of the stanza, when you realize the dead thing is irretrievably gone.

Slate,L,Police shootings: President Obama must demand an accurate count of the number of people killed by law enforcement.,"This week, President Obama vowed to use his final two years in office to address the simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color. The first tangible step toward that goal: the presidents request for $263 million to buy 50,000 body-worn cameras for police departments around the country, and to pay for expanded officer training. Those proposals are promising, but the president is missing a more obvious first step. He should immediately call for all law enforcement agencies to keep an accurate count of how many people the police kill each year.

Slate,L,"The conservative case for reforming the police and how to do it, in three steps.","If a neoconservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality, as Irving Kristol once put it, what do you call a conservative faced with video footage of the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a man the New York Police Department confronted for the crime of selling contraband cigarettes?

In the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, conservatives and liberals found themselves taking familiar stances. Those on the right were by and large inclined to give a local police officer the benefit of the doubt. Those on the left maintained that use of lethal force against Brown was unjustified, and that the failure to indict Darren Wilson reflected the deeply ingrained racism of the American criminal justice system.


The case of Garner has met with a strikingly different response from conservatives, as Tim Lee of Vox recently observed. Bill OReilly of Fox News, a man known for channeling the populist id of older white conservatives, somberly expressed his horror at Garners death on Wednesday night. More pointedly, Tim Carney, a leading light of the conservative intelligentsia and a columnist for the Washington Examiner, pointed to Garners death of an illustration of the dangers of an unaccountable, excessively strong government.

Having grown up in Brooklyn in the 1980s and lived through the explosion of violence that accompanied the crack epidemic, I came to deeply appreciate the dangerous and difficult work done by the NYPD. Like most conservatives, my gut-level sympathies are with police officers who find themselves in situations that can quickly spiral out of control. And I believe that the most important job of the police is to protect innocent people from harm, a job the NYPD has generally done well. But there is no question that something has gone badly wrong with policing in many of our cities. When high-crime neighborhoods grow to distrust local law enforcement, local law enforcement finds it more difficult to do its job. Anger and anxiety build, and sometimes it explodes.


Of course, conservative fears about law enforcement run amok are different from those invoked by liberals. Conservatives, particularly libertarian-minded conservatives, are far more likely to point to the expansion of government as a driver of police abuses, a claim that at least some liberals find risible, or even offensive. Moreover, they are far less likely to chalk up police brutality to straightforward racism. Fear of the police, a fact of life for young black and brown menparticularly those living in neighborhoods plagued by violent crime, ironically enoughis largely unknown on the American right, which is disproportionately white and either suburban or rural.


Yet it is an oversimplification to see our excessive reliance on punitive crime-control policies through a racial lens. Consider the invaluable work of James Forman Jr., a clinical professor at Yale Law School, who has argued that black Americans played a larger role in the rise of broken windows policing and mass incarceration than is commonly understood.



What government routinely fails to do is account for the costs the criminal justice system imposes on the civilians who get caught in its web.



Forman has recounted the role of Harlem-based black activists in the late 1960s in pushing for New York states notorious Rockefeller drug laws. Those laws imposed draconian sentences for drug offenses and set the tone for a wave of similar tough-on-crime measures that spread around the country in the years that followed. He details the rise of more punitive policies in black-majority jurisdictions with black-majority police forces, focusing in particular on Washington, D.C. Formans work absolutely does not prove that racism played no role in the incarceration boom that has done so much to devastate poor black neighborhoods. Rather, he reminds readers that the fact that young black men face shockingly disproportionate rates of violent crime had led a not inconsiderable number of black Americans to embrace tough-on-crime policies. The fear of crime that drove these policies was not unique to whites, and it is not just whites who bear responsibility for the many ways these policies have gone wrong.


If conservatives accept that the worst excesses of law enforcement need to be reined in, what are the appropriate next steps? And is there room for common ground with liberals who see the roots of the dysfunction of our criminal justice system very differently?


There are grounds for optimism. In 2012, Steven Teles and David Dagan described how a coalition of conservative policy entrepreneurs and GOP elected officials had set out to reduce incarceration levels, having grown troubled by the ugly moral consequences of separating fathers, boyfriends, and husbands from their families. This impulse needs to inform every aspect of policymaking around criminal justice.


What government routinely fails to do is account for the costs the criminal justice system imposes on the civilians who get caught in its web. Mark A.R. Kleiman, a public policy professor at UCLA and author of When Brute Force Fails, made this point vividly in a Democracy Journal essay published last spring. Instead of fixating on the dollar costs of running the criminal justice system, he asks that we also account for the suffering inflicted by arrest, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration, including all of the residual disabilities that go with the label ex-convict, and the fear created by overaggressive policing.


Imagine if, as Cardozo Law School professor Richard A. Bierschbach has suggested, we had in place a punishment budget. Given such a budget, we would accept that the criminal justice system would cause some degree of suffering. At the same time, wed insist that if you pass some measures that increase suffering in some waysay, by making more arrestsyoud have to reduce the sum total of suffering in some other way, for instance by reducing prison sentences for nonviolent offenders. This would impose a useful check on the creep of new laws, rules, and regulations that steadily increase the governments coercive powers, as if on autopilot.


Establishing a punishment budget is only the first step that the right can and should rally around. The second is insisting on greater transparency. We need better, more reliable data on policing so that communities have a clear sense of what local law enforcement agencies are doing in their name. The chief resistance to greater transparency comes from police unions. Conservatives, whove long been critical of public sector unions for imposing rigid work rules and contributing to soaring compensation costs, should have no qualms about calling for their abolition. When teachers unions fight tooth and nail on behalf of teachers accused of misconduct, its a problem. When police unions do the same on behalf of police officers accused of endangering the lives of civilians, and in some cases killing them, its a very big problem indeed. Republicans are often wary of curbing the collective bargaining rights of public safety employees, due to their political influence and their conservative sympathies. That has to change.


The third step is to encourage a more localized approach to criminal justice, an idea thats been championed by Bierschbach and by Stephanos Bibas of Penn Law School. Both have pointed to the encouraging example of the Red Hook Community Justice Center, a court that employs people with a deep knowledge of their Brooklyn neighborhood, and that is more likely to mandate community supervision than to send low-level offenders to jail. Because the men and women who work for the center know the neighborhood so well, they have a better sense of which offenders represent a serious and ongoing threat to law-abiding citizens and which need nothing more than structure and discipline in their lives. Better still, the centers approach leads local residents to think of it as an ally working to keep the neighborhood safe rather than as an enemy looking to snatch away their troubled young men.


The community court model is no panacea. It works better in some places than others. But it does resonate with many of the things that conservatives care about most: It makes use of the little platoons of civil society, it respects local priorities and values, and there is at least some evidence that its much cheaper than business as usual. If local law enforcement is ever going to become more humane and more legitimate, becoming more local is absolutely essential.

The U.S. drilling revival, which has seen daily oil production grow roughly 60 percent since mid-2011, was fueled by high crude prices that made profitable the expensive process of extracting oil trapped in shale and other rock deposits. But the days of $100 hydrocarbons are over for now. With the world momentarily pumping more oil than it can use, the cost of a barrel has swan-dived below $70.

The labor force participation rate, which is at lows not seen since the 1970s (you know, before women had fully entered the workforce), has at least managed to hold steady since April. Some of the broader measures of pain in the labor market, which count Americans who can't find a full time job for economic reasons or who want a job but have given up on searching, have also been trending steadily downward. On the other hand, private sector wages are still only up a low 2.1 percent for the yearwhich is to say, the job market isn't getting so hot that employees suddenly have the power to ask for a significant raise.

Slate,L,Still Alice review: Julianne Moore in an Alzheimers movie based on the Lisa Genova book.,"For several days after watching Still Alice, a tender and deeply sad adaptation of Lisa Genovas best-selling novel about a woman living with early-onset Alzheimers, I caught myself scouring my everyday behavior for evidence of my own impending decline. Why couldnt I remember the name of a familiar character actor when his face popped up on TV? (It turned out to be Zeljko Ivanek, whose name youd think would be simple to remember, if not to pronounce.) What were my house keys doing in the dogs empty water bowl? The degrees by which Alice Howland (Julianne Moore), a linguistics professor whos diagnosed at the shockingly young age of 50, becomes aware of her condition are gradual enough at first that blunders as small as this might matter. And Moore is so hauntingly good as Alice that, having spent the films swift-moving 101 minutes in her company, you cant help feeling youve already walked some way down the path of dementia with her.


The script isnt always up to the level of Moores performance, which is so profound and simple, devoid of sentimentality or actressy self-regard.



I didnt yet know while watching it that the production history of Still Alice uncannily mirrors the films themes and story. The two directors, who also co-wrote the script, are married, and one of them, Richard Glatzer, was diagnosed with ALS shortly before he and husband Wash Westmoreland decided to adapt Genovas novelin fact, it was the shock of that diagnosis that prompted them to take on the material. During the filming, Glatzers condition deteriorated to the point of needing to communicate through a text-to-speech iPad app. The wisdom lent by this experienceof being a couple struggling with degenerative illness while collaborating on a film about that very subjectmay be what gives Still Alice its quiet, unmelodramatic directness. Glatzer and Westmoreland dont need to stack the emotional deck on Alices behalf or wring tears from the irony of a brilliant linguists cognitive decline. They just leave the camera on Moores beautiful but increasingly faraway face, and our tears come on their own.


Before Alice Howlands diagnosis, she has just about everything a person could reasonably want from life: a tenured professorship at an Ivy League school, teaching a subject she cares passionately about. An adoring, successful research-scientist husband (Alec Baldwin). Three grown children (Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish, and Kristen Stewart) who are all more or less happily making their way in the world. A Manhattan brownstone thats pristine and exquisitely appointed even by the standards of Hollywood-movie brownstones. Alice has even lucked into whatever genetic oddity it is that creates human specimens as impossibly good-looking as Julianne Moore. But Alices lifelong luck is about to run out. A few days after her 50th birthday, she goes jogging on the Columbia University campus and suddenly gets disoriented. Standing outside the library shes used for years, she cant remember how to get back homea fact the filmmakers establish not with dialogue or voiceover but through the use of unsettling music (the score is by Ilan Eshkeri) and shallow focus that turns Alices surroundings into an indistinguishable blur (the warm-hued cinematography is by Denis Lenoir, known for his work with the French masters Olivier Assayas and Jacques Audiard).


    Advertisement




Still Alices script isnt always up to the level of Moores performance, which is so profound and simple, so devoid of sentimentality or actressy self-regard, that it almost seems obscene to mention the word Oscar (even if I am now firmly on Team Julianne). The stages of Alices decline are sometimes too clearly signposted and foreshadowed, in a way that can make the audience feel were simply hunkered down waiting for the other shoe to dropthough to be fair, that faintly tedious sense of entrapment probably resembles the actual experience of loving an Alzheimers victim. There are breaks in the entropy, though, including one genuinely inspiring scene in which Alice, in the middle stages of her decline, is asked to give a speech for a gathering of fellow Alzheimers patients and their families. Having stubbornly insisted on preparing her talk according to the exacting linguistic standards of her old professorial self, Alice seems to have set herself up for humiliating failure. But the speech is an unexpected triumphthough Alices radiant smile at the enthusiastic ovation she receives is edged with sorrow. This carefully worded and painstakingly rehearsed speech, we realize, was intended as an official farewell to the mastery of language she once so effortlessly commanded.


As Alices mind begins to slip, her relationships shift in surprising ways. Her apparently stable marriage begins to reveals its cracks even as she grows closer to her youngest daughter, an aspiring actress who has disappointed her scholarly mother by flatly refusing to go to college. (Kristen Stewart, who I think by now has earned the right to leave Twilight associations in her past, is perfect as the rebellious and cranky prodigal daughter.) No movie that kicks off with a diagnosis of Alzheimers is going to have what youd call a happy ending, but some late scenes between Moore and Stewart capture the way the disease, in stripping away the person you thought you knew, can reveal someone new and precious underneath. Near the end, Stewarts Lydia, preparing for an audition, reads her mother a long, lyrical passage from Tony Kushners play Angels in America. What do you think that was about, Mom? she cant resist asking, in an attempt to get inside her mothers increasingly foggy head. Alice takes a moment to find the word, but when she comes up with one, its le mot juste: love.

Slate,L,"Peter Pan Live! on NBC, starring Allison Williams and Christopher Walken, reviewed.","It is only the second year in a row that NBC has aired a live musical in December, but it already feels like something of a holiday tradition. As with most traditions, it doesnt really matter if it is good or not; the relevant thing is that it exists, and is capable of absorbing all of the good or ill will thrown its way. Last years widely watched production of The Sound of Music was often wildly unprofessional, and yet I was utterly charmed by it (even as I cackled at all the mean, apt tweets about Carrie Underwoods acting skills). Thursday nights live version of Peter Pan was an improvement in almost every way, but I suspect it could have been much, much worse and still left me with the same cozy, anachronistic feeling. In no time at all, these live musicals have made themselves into communal events, and there is something lovely about sharing an experience with so many other people, even if most of what we are sharing is snark and shock that anything so visually unpolished could possibly air on network television. If the way we save Tinkerbell these days is with a hashtag, well, at least were still saving Tinkerbell together.

Peter Pan Live! was a much more ambitious and skilled staging than The Sound of Music. Allison Williams wildly exceeded my admittedly very low expectations of her, not only performing circles around Underwood, but doing a flat-out good job, even while saddled with an unnecessary British accent. Christopher Walken as Captain Hook behaved exactly like Christopher Walken, which is to say as though he were operating in his own personal time zone. He sometimes appeared to have forgotten his lines, and at other times it seemed as though he just wanted it to seem like he had forgotten his lines. At other times he tap-danced his heart out. A little more energy might have gone well with his dashing beauty mark, but you dont hire Christopher Walken so that hell give you a predictable performance. Broadway star Kelli OHara, who played Mrs. Darling, was a reminder that there are very talented people who do live theater with unerring excellence every night and NBC might consider hiring such a person to be the star of the show next time. And then there was the dog playing Nana. She can really turn down a bed.

In general, the production was much more grand and visually exciting than last yearsand not only because of Christian Borles bulging arm muscles in the role of Smee. The camera, especially at the start, was almost queasily mobile, but it settled down eventually. And thank goodness: extensively choreographed dance routines from three different troupesthe Lost Boys, The Pirates, and Tiger Lilys tribewouldnt have looked great while wobbling. The wires that made the flying possible were plain to see (they dont make flying wires in a translucent material?), but the early scene of Peter and the Darlings soaring out of the house into the night was genuinely joyful. And the Technicolor Neverland sets were like cotton candy for the eyes: an intense and immediate sugar rush.

The real problem for Peter Pan Live! was the source material. That is one weird musical! I grew up watching a worn-out VHS of the Mary Martin version (performed live on television in 1960), and while I recalled lots of angst about mothers and aging, I was not quite prepared for the shows other endlessly odd innuendos. Its not just the Lost Boys who are longing for a mother, but the grown pirates, too, who want to kidnap the teenage Wendy and make her their mother (but, you know, not in a creepy way). Peter may be a perpetual boy, but that doesnt stop Tinkerbell, Wendy, and Tiger Lily from territorially fighting over him, a simmering subtext of nasty girl-on-girl competition over an emotionally stunted man-child. (Peter Pan only passes the Bechdel test because Peter is traditionally in drag.) There are the racial issues surrounding Tiger Lily, who in this version got a slightly updated song, but who was still surrounded by men in loincloths and convinced that the white Peter was the sun and the moon and the stars. And, as people on Twitter had endless fun pointing out, there was the homoerotic subtext of the Lost Boys (who share one bathtub) and the very muscular pirates, who dance with each other in pantaloons. Even the ticking crocodile, played by a person in a purple spandex suit, was suggestively slinky.


There were also some serious problems with the shows bookmade worse by the direction, which had clearly focused on the song-and-dance numbers: The stretches of dialogue barely, if ever, made any sense. Their general incoherence made the show feel surprisingly momentum-less, evenperhaps especiallywhen it came to the fight sequences. If the pirates are really supposed to be a scary threat, maybe they could act like it from time to time? The climactic battle between Peter and Captain Hook had all the urgency of slo-mo waltz, with Hook and Peter lackadaisically waving swords in one anothers direction like they were pipe-cleaners. All the hard-to-grasp dialogue was even more frustrating because it could so easily have been cut, which might have brought the shows run time down to a perfect two hours. Yes, its true, if these live extravaganzas were only two hours, NBC would not be able to air 30 minutes of Walmart commercials starring Melissa Joan Hart, but its sure nice to dream that some daymaybe next year!quality might be put before ad dollars.

Slate,L,Caitlyn Ricci college tuition lawsuit: Divorced parents are obliged to pay ongoing support.,"Can a young adult force her parents to pay for the cost of her college education?

Maybe, but fair warning: If you try, you might be met with death threats. Just ask Caitlyn Ricci, who has wrung $16,000 out of her divorced mom and dad and has inspired broad outrage in suddenly nervous parents and throughout the Internet. Thats how much a New Jersey trial judge recently commanded the couple to cough up toward Caitlyns costs for attending Philadelphias Temple University.


Everyone has a visceral reaction to this case, and its easy to see why. First, there are the lurid details of this story. Caitlyn left her mothers house early last year. Whether she was kicked out or decided to leave is disputed, but the next time either parent heard from her was several months later, when they were hauled into court. In the meantime, shed been taken in by her paternal grandparents, who are funding the lawsuit. (Not surprisingly, Caitlyns dad, Michael Ricci, has zero respect for his parents.) Oh, and Caitlyns lawsuit also demanded that her parents help her pay for a new car. (Denied.) Theres also the small matter of some $906 that Caitlyn claims was supposed to have been paid to her last year, a number that the parents dispute. Thats the subject of another upcoming hearing. Get the popcorn.



Should it matter that there were cheaper schools available?

But the story raises deeper issues. What obligations should parents have once children reach the age of majority? With the costs of college rising to absurd levels, should parents who can afford to kick in some cash be forced to do so? And if so, should it matter that there were cheaper schools available? Should the law care whether the family is intact? (It does, as well see.) And should the undeniable fact that the parents and the young adult are estranged from each other affect the obligation?


Some background will be helpful. Fathersand, more recently, mothershave long had an enforceable duty to support their kids during childhood. But with the exception of disabled children, that obligation usually ceases at the age of majority. Until recently, 21 was that age. But things changedproblematically for college studentswhen the 26th Amendment was ratified in 1971. By terms, the law only lowered the voting age to 18but as a practical matter, it led to making 18- to 20-year-olds adults for all purposes (except for drinking and running for federal offices, which may or may not be connected).


The law zipped through the ratification process in record time (three months!), so presumably state legislators gave little thought to the possible impact on parental obligations. But the amendment came at a bad time for students who wanted support for their higher education: The number of 18- to 24-year-olds attending college more than doubled from 1970 to 2010. The upshot: Parental obligations ceased just as the need for post-secondary education took hold as a national norm.


So why shouldnt parents have to pony up what they can? Isnt doing so a good investment, and a better way to help your kids than the historically common way of doing sothrough inheritance?


Maybe, yet states have held firm to the rule that the obligation to support your kids ends at the age of majority, whatever that happens to be. Unless, that is, the parents of the young adult seeking support happen to be divorced or never married. In such cases, about one-half the statesincluding New Jerseysometimes make the non-custodial parent pay for college or other post-high school education. (Not for other stuff, like the car Caitlyn wanted.)


Usually its the custodial parent who sues the non-custodial parent for support. But increasingly, as in the sad case of Caitlyn Ricci and her parents, custody and support obligations are more complex. Thats why this case pits daughter against both parents. In a bizarre twist on The Parent Trap (the one with Hayley Mills, please!), the case has united the parents, divorced for some 17 years, in anger and opposition to their ingrate offspring.*


What justifies making a distinction between intact families and broken ones? Arent kids in both families in need of scholarship scratch? Thats what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court thought, in a 1995 decision that declared that states law authorizing college contributions by divorced parents only to be an unconstitutional denial of equality. But the Keystone State stands alone in this regard. (Michael Ricci and Maura McGarvey, Caitlyns mom, probably wish they lived on the other side of the Delaware River.) Most states find these laws perfectly acceptable, because the statistics consistently show that divorce leads to disengagement from kids lives, and that parents who would otherwise pay for college do so less frequently after marriages crumble. So the laws have a rational basis, and thats enough.


I dont think this intact vs. broken family distinction is going to hold much longer, though, and in fact decisions like this point the way forward for all young adults to force their parents to cough up college cash. Combine an angry 19-year-old and a creative attorney, and were going to get some variation of the argument that age is just a number. The real question, theyll say, is whether the young adult is in fact emancipatednot whether some arbitrary age has been attained. Given todays texting-while-hovering parents and the impossibility of kids paying for their own college education, a broad ruling that majority doesnt equal emancipation seems inevitable. And if no emancipation, the support obligation continues.

OK, but why Temple? Why not a cheaper school? Say, one in her home state of New Jersey, where shed get in-state tuition? Its a good question, but courts have generally preferred to look at each case individually and not to generally require that every kid choose the least expensive option. Otherwise, it would be community college for alla result McGarvey and the older Ricci might welcome, especially since they have a combined five younger kids from their second marriages to consider. But since kids in intact marriages dont always have to choose the cheapest option, neither do the offspring of divorced parents.


This isnt over. The judge has ordered the parties back for a conference this coming Monday, presumably to get them to settle this ugly thing. And the parents attorneys raise issues that might get an appellate courts attention if the case cant be resolved. Can a young adult spurn contact with her parents while still claiming she is not emancipated? Can she force parents to pay for an expensive college that neither one of them even knew she was interested in?


Well, at the very least the parents can see an end to this family nightmare after college, right? Not necessarily. Theres at least one caseyes, from New Jerseyin which a court ordered a parent to contribute to his childs law school education. The chains of filial obligation can be hard to snap.

Slate,L,"Amazing libraries from around the world in the book, Reflections: Libraries.","Libraries are at once solitary and social, often serving as cornerstones of communities. Throughout history, their design has developed alongside the democratization of knowledge. A new book, Reflections: Libraries, which was published by Roads in November, traces this evolution through buildings that, whether modern and inviting or ancient and exclusive, are marvelous to see.

The first library in the book is the Library of Alexandria in Egypt. It then traverses the globe, from the minimalist, modern libraries of Asia and Scandinavia to the lavish classical libraries of the United States and Western Europe, including the Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Centre at Humboldt University in Berlin, with its five stories of cherry-wood terraces.


In terms of function, we aimed to have a wide representation. There are some of the largest libraries in the world, private libraries, university libraries, and small community libraries, Maeve Convery, publishing director for Roads and editor ofReflections: Librariessaid via email. Some were chosen because of the extremely interesting design, such as Stuttgart City Library, and others have unparalleled historical significance, like the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.

Classical libraries catered for the privileged classes, so the design and dcor were lavish and often church-like. The libraries of the 18thcentury, such as Admont and Melk Libraries in Austria,took this elaborate, decorative style of library building to its extreme. Beginning in the mid-19thcentury, libraries like the Saint-Genevive Library in Paris became more open and elegant, using innovative construction techniques, and responding to the needs of a more diverse audience. In the 21stcentury, libraries like the Seattle Central Library are daring and innovative, responding to the demands of a digital world and a changing environment.


The modern library is inclusive and accommodates all social classes, genders and ages.It seems the very nature of the library, as a cathedral of knowledge, has encouraged architects to challenge tradition and be experimental, Convery said.

While some argue that the Internet and new media may pose a threat to the printed book, many architects think the role and influence of libraries is likely to expand as the need for new adaptable and accessible learning spaces increases.


Nowadays, when information is accessible to almost every one, at all times, the sense of community offered by the library is vital, and will continue to be so as we become more tech-obsessed. The greatest challenge and opportunity for the architect, then, is creating a democratic and lasting social space for the public.

Slate,L,Senator Wyden proposes Secure Data Act to keep government agencies from mandating encryption backdoors.,"Revelations about the NSA have led to a broader awareness that government agencies often demand backdoors in encryption. Google and Apple even added security in their new mobile operating systems that makes it impossible for them to decrypt user data. That way they can't be compelled to hand anything over to law enforcement.

Needless to say, government agencies are not happy about this. FBI Director James Comey feels that providing true, uncompromised encryption to consumers means, marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves above the law. But on Thursday,Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., introduced a bill called the Secure Data Act that would generally prohibit government agencies from demanding backdoors in software or hardware. He said in a statement:



Strong encryption and sound computer security is the best way to keep Americans data safe from hackers and foreign threats. It is the best way to protect our constitutional rights at a time when a persons whole life can often be found on his or her smartphone. ... This bill sends a message to leaders of those agencies to stop recklessly pushing for new ways to vacuum up Americans private information, and instead put that effort into rebuilding public trust.


    Advertisement




Bills aimed at curtailing surveillance have failed to pass in the Senate this month (also most of the time), and the Secure Data Act will probably face the same uphill battle. As Ars Technica points out, an amendment similar to the Secure Data Act passed the House in June, but never became a bill.


It's worth noting, though, that the Secure Data Act doesn't actually prohibit backdoorsit just prohibits agencies from mandating them. There are a lot of other types of pressure government groups could still use to influence the creation of backdoors, even if they couldn't flat-out demand them.


Here's the wording in the bill: ""No agency may mandate that a manufacturer, developer, or seller of covered products design or alter the security functions in its product or service to allow the surveillance of any user of such product or service, or to allow the physical search of such product, by any agency.""

Slate,L,Network TV sitcoms: Four tips to get network TV out of the Great Sitcom Recession.,"This article originally appeared in Vulture.

November was another bad month in whats been a pretty awful couple of years for the once-mighty network sitcom. NBC, which dominated the TV business for nearly two decades based on the strength of its comedy bench, announced it was ceding custody of an already-filmed Ellie Kemper half-hour from producer Tina Fey and selling the project to Netflix. The decision had nothing to do with the shows qualityNetflix liked it so much, it has already ordered a second seasonbut instead was a depressing admission by the Peacock that it felt there was virtually no chance it could make the show a success given the networks lack of even a single sitcom hit. This weeks announcement that NBC would also burn through the final season of the Amy Poehlerled Parks and Recreation in under two months added an exclamation point to the declaration of surrender: Rather than use the swan song of its longest-running and most critically admired half-hour to launch a successor sitcom, the network (probably correctly) decided it would be better off giving Parks a semi-dignified send-off and quickly moving on.


    Advertisement




A similar come-to-Jesus moment was likely behind CBSs unexpectedly early cancellation of the Will ArnettMargo Martindale sitcom The Millers, just weeks into its sophomore season. The same network that had always managed to make America fall in like with middle-of-the-road sitcoms such as Rules of Engagement, Still Standing, and Mike and Molly seemed to be conceding even it no longer had the power to force us to sit still for whatever mediocrity it slotted behind a monster hit (in this case, The Big Bang Theory). By themselves, the NBC and CBS decisions didnt dramatically alter the small-screen landscape. Taken together, theyre symptoms of something far more depressing: Network TV is suffering through a Great Sitcom Recession, and there arent many signs of recovery on the horizon.


At first blush, the downturn in the sitcom economy might appear to just be part of the larger crisis facing the overall linear TV businessthe oft-documented challenges posed by audience fragmentation, time-shifting, and the growth of streaming networks such as Netflix. But while times are tough all over, its different with comedy. Even as TV transforms itself in real time, broadcasters have still managed to find a way to restock their shelves with new drama hits: The Blacklist, Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, Chicago Fire, and, possibly, this seasons Gotham and Scorpion. By contrast, the last time the networks launched an enduring, game-changing comedy smash was way back in 2009, when Modern Family exploded out of the gate for ABC. And its not just that there havent been a lot of new blockbusters. Scan Nielsens list of this seasons top 20 most-watched shows (below), and youll find just two comedies, period: Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory. This paucity of half-hour hits has left networks insiders confused and reeling, according to one top TV agent with deep ties to the comedy community. Its not quite dread, but more a sense of What the fuck? he says. Theres a question of What do people want?



  Vulture


 

For those who subscribe to the everything is cyclical theory of television, the answer to that last question is simple: Viewers just want more good comedies. Comedy will be dead until it isnt, says one broadcast veteran, who believes the genre is simply stuck in one of its periodic droughts. Industry insiders have called a code blue on comedy many times before. Most recently, more than a few small-screen pundits thought Friends would mark the end of the Universally Beloved Sitcom, until Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady made The Big Bang Theory a weekly obsession for more than 20 million Americans. But just as the economic crisis of 2008 was more than a standard-issue recession, comedys current troubles register as deeper than past downturns. NBC, which at one point in the 1990s had a weekly lineup packed with a whopping 18 sitcoms, could very well enter the 201516 TV season without a single returning half-hour. CBS cut back to a single hour of sitcoms on Mondays this fall for the first time in decades (and might even drop half-hours on the night altogether next season). Over at Fox, its biggest live-action comedy, New Girl, struggles to get to 5 million viewers each week.


The array of issues plaguing sitcoms right now suggests the traditional means of resurrectionmaking better showsmight not be enough. So how should networks battle back? In its announcement regarding its canceled Kemper comedy, NBC said it was focused on its drama-heavy midseason schedule, indicating retreat would be its short-term solution. But comedy is too essential a genre for networks to abandon altogether. Broadcasters have to come up with new strategies to deal with the comedy crisis. Based on our conversations with a number of TV-industry veterans, Vulture would like to suggest this modest list of four simple rules for pulling out of this recession and avoiding a depression:


1. Dont launch a comedy you dont believe in and arent willing to get behind.


The incredibly brief lifespans of ABCs fall comedies Selfie and Manhattan Love Story (both of which will burn off their unaired episodes on Hulu), along with de facto cancellations of NBC newbies Bad Judge and A to Z, were easily predicted before the shows even debuted, mostly because of how their respective networks handled their launches. ABC slotted Selfie and Love Story Tuesdays from 8 to 9 p.m., depriving them of an established lead-in and pitting them opposite the biggest hits on both NBC (The Voice) and CBS (NCIS). NBC bundled the thematically dissimilar Bad Judge and A to Z together on Thursday nights opposite ABCs juggernaut Scandal while simultaneously announcing their 9 p.m. time slot would be filled by The Blacklist come February. Add in the fact that none of the four shows got much of a promotional push over the summer, and it was pretty clear Alphabet and Peacock execs werent counting on long lives for any of the shows. Historically, such obvious burn-offs have been accepted as an unavoidable by-product of a broadcast business model in which widespread failure is baked in. Unlike cable nets, which generally have the luxury of focusing on just one or two big scripted premieres every quarter, the Big Four can find themselves rolling out upward of two dozen new and returning shows over the course of a single month. Thats by design: Networks take a lot of shots because, the theory goes, the more at-bats you take, the better the chance of getting a home run.


But, at least with comedies, maybe its time for networks to get out of the assembly-line business. The old model relied heavily on the idea of audience flow, where a sizable percentage of the viewers who tuned in for Friends or The Big Bang Theory would automatically stay tuned for the next one, two, or three comedies on a lineup. Lead-ins are still importantmaybe more so than ever beforebut were now in an age where, save for Big Bang and Modern Family, there simply arent blockbuster comedies that can reliably serve as launching pads for newer shows. With a shortage of comedy hits, networks shouldnt be wasting their energies on shows they dont believe in, and if they do love a show, they need to have a better game plan for it. Reasonable people can disagree about whether NBCs lack of faith in its Kemper comedy was justifiable, but this much is certain: Wasting time and money on a show it didnt believe in wouldve been a far bigger mistake.


2. Stick with good comedies that have a passionate audience rather than cycle through a series of untested shows.


This is a corollary to Rule No. 1: In addition to not green-lighting shows they dont absolutely love, networks should demonstrate extreme patience with those they do orderas long as those shows are connecting with at least some segment of the audience. This philosophy partially explains why Fox just committed to additional episodes of The Mindy Project, ensuring the low-rated show will survive for at least three seasons. While its overall ratings are minuscule, even by Fox standards these days, a closer look at its demographic composition reveals that among younger women, Mindy is a minor juggernaut. This weeks episode, for example, scored the same rating among women 18 to 34 as lead-in New Girl while handily beating ABCs Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and NBCs About a Boy in that demo. If Im a network, I would rather have a show that does a 2 rating with young women than a show that does a 1.4 rating across all demos, our TV agent says. The audience has become so fragmented that its rare to have a show that hits that quadrant of the audience. The super-loyal young female fan base for Mindy is also appealing to streaming providers such as Netflix, which has demonstrated itll pay top dollar for the right to stream shows with passionate core audiences. If a network owns the syndication rights to a showas Fox does with New Girl, but not Mindyit can offset the loss in advertiser revenue that comes from sticking by a lower-rated show.


Historically, one argument against being overly patient was that sticking by a Nielsen laggard, a network was reducing its odds of finding the next big hit or, at the very least, accepting that it couldnt be doing better with something else. But that was back in an era when it was much easier for networks to launch hits of any kind. Big broadcast hits take a lot longer now to find their audience, one network exec says. Plus, many in TV land are now convinced that viewers have become increasingly savvy to how the industry works and might even be holding off before committing to a new series. There are so many comedies launched each year that weve trained viewers to expect [quick cancellations], another top network suit says. Theres no reward for viewers to start a habit with a new comedy early on. None of this is to suggest that some shows dont deserve a quick death. If a show isnt doing what you want it to creatively and its going nowhere in the ratings, fine, cancel it, move on, the agent says. But you really need to know you can do better.


3. Figure out a way to get good writers interested in making multi-camera comedies again.


For most of the past decade, Hollywoods best comedic minds have largely been focused on creating Very Cool Comedies that are shot like films (so-called single-cam shows). Traditional multi-cam sitcomsones taped live in front of a studio audience,  la Big Bang or Cheers have fallen hopelessly out of favor among comedy elites. Even multi-cam vets such as Modern Family creators Steve Levitan and Christopher Lloyd (who cut their teeth on Frasier and Wings) and The Middles DeAnn Heline and Eileen Heisler (Roseanne) have now become converts to the gospel of single-cam. This exodus has resulted not only in TVs best writers largely ignoring a form, but also a diminished number of opportunities for younger scribes to get training in the ways of old-school sitcoms. Writers are being groomed and schooled on single-camera comedies, one network exec laments. Theyre not doing multi-camera. And multi-cam is a real skill and a real art. These people are real craftsmen in the art of story structure and joke writing. While networksparticularly CBShave tried to keep multi-cams going, theyve been doing so largely without the help of the genres best veteran talent and with a collection of younger writers who havent had enough training in the form.


Its tempting to think that maybe this isnt really a problem, that perhaps market forces and viewer evolution are simply conspiring to push multi-cams to extinction. But if networks are serious about producing hit comedies that can live forever in syndication and streaming, it seems silly to limit the odds of success by focusing their efforts on one type of half-hour (single-cam) while neglecting a format that still clearly has an ability to draw big crowds (as demonstrated each week by The Big Bang Theory and its audience of 20 million viewers). This doesnt mean broadcasters should produce multi-cam comedies just for the sake of doing multi-cam (see The Millers or Dads). Instead, networks ought to beg creators whove hand single-cam successthink Mike Schur (Parks and Recreation), Greg Daniels (The Office), or Liz Meriwether (New Girl)to focus on multi-cams for a couple of years. Why not a Manhattan Project for multi-cams, where the best and brightest comedy minds are encouraged and empowered to freshen up the format, to find the next Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, or Frasier? At the same time, nets should shore up their support for existing multi-cams with even the hint of a pulse. CBSs Mom and ABCs Cristela, for example, boast solid writing and strong points of view at their centers; they need to be supported in every way possible.


As part of a push to take more multi-cam chances, some observers also believe network development execs need to stop gravitating toward projects that appeal to their own personal tastes rather than mesh with what else is working on a given network. This, they say, is how NBC ends up programming quirky shows such as Go On or About a Boy behind a broad-based smash such as The Voice, or why ABC spent years banging its head against the wall trying to convince the Modern Family audience to embrace the sex-crazed singles of Happy Endings, Dont Trust the B---- in Apt. 23, and Super Fun Night. Too many people who work in comedy develop shows they like rather than the shows a network needs, says one network exec frustrated by his colleagues inclinations.


4. Take more chances on unproven talent and ideas.


As networks have become more desperate for hits, theyve started emulating their peers in the film businessrelying more and more on established writers/producers and developing an endless parade of remakes and reboots of past movie and TV hits. Want to get depressed in a hurry? Check out the long list of movie and TV titles currently being eyed as possible TV comedies: Bewitched, Hitch, The Greatest American Hero, Real Genius, The Courtship of Eddies Father, Problem Child, Bachelor Party, Big, Marley & Me, and Monster-in-Law. Networks seem convinced they need instantly recognizable titles to help them cut through the programming clutter, even though they know better than anyone that TVs biggest hits have been wholly original. The problem is even worse when it comes to who works on shows: Stars still trump unknowns most of the time, and established showrunners are far more likely to get the best time slots.


Theres such risk aversion, says a longtime broadcast warrior depressed by the fear-based philosophy that guides so many decisions. We should be taking chances on new voices, but the talent pool we choose from is too thin. And were recycling a lot of the same stars on shows. You want to find the next Ray Romano or Sofia Vegara. This doesnt mean broadcasters should turn over their futures to folks just starting out in TV: ABCs Black-ish and The Goldbergs both come from writers who are pushing 40 but didnt have a long list of created-by credits. Rather, execs ought to worry less about managing relationships with current business partners (sorry, Chuck Lorre and Tina Fey) and focus more on giving a shot to folks who havent had as many at-bats creating comedies. Or, if network suits just cant stand the thought of handing over prime-time real estate to someone totally untested, maybe they ought to compromise by letting writers and producers from other genres bring a fresh set of eyes to comedy. Wed check out a Shonda Rhimes sitcom in a heartbeat.

Slate,L,Aquaculture: Farmed fish could be better for the environment.,"Early last year, a study by the international ocean conservation organization Oceana made waves by reporting that one-third of all seafood sold in the United States was mislabeled, according to DNA testing. Consumers were understandably upset to learn that their wild red snapper could be cheap, farmed tilapia or that their wild salmon was actually raised in a tank. Fish fraud, it seemed, was rampant.

In the not-so-distant future, however, the reverse may hold true: Consumers may be aghast to find out that their sustainably farmed halibut was actually trawled from a commercial fishery. After all, seafood remains one of the last types of foods that we harvest from the wild at a commercial level, and fully 90 percent of the worlds fisheries are deemed overexploited or exhausted. This year, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), aquaculture surpassed wild capture as our main source of seafood for the first time. That makes 2014 the year of peak wild fish.


A joint OECD-FAO report shows that the global appetite for the fruits of the sea will grow over the next several decades. With wild fish supply flat, aquaculture is filling in the gap and taking pressure off our oceans. Since the 1990s, aquaculture production has more than tripled, and today, more than 200 species of fish and seafood are raised in farms.

The rapid expansion of aquaculture has not been without tradeoffs, and, arguably, its meteoric rise contributed to our wariness of fish farms today.


In the early days of aquaculture, the dream was to reinvent the economic, social, and technical practice of fish productionBlue Revolution much in the same way that the Green Revolution had transformed agriculture. Famed undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau captured this hope when he wrote in 1973, With earths burgeoning human populations to feed, we must turn to the sea with new understanding and new technology.


His declaration became a favorite mantra in the aquaculture world, capturing the pro-science zeitgeist that characterized America in the wake of the Russian launch of Sputnik. Rising consumer demand for seafood after World War II, coupled with increasing pressure on wild fish stocks, meant new solutions were needed. In 1963, President Lyndon Johnson appointed a scientific committee with the explicit mission of better understanding aquaculture. A main outcome was the Sea Grant Program (modeled after the land-grant program of the 1880s), which spearheaded ocean research at universities across the States.


The buzz around aquaculture was not limited to the United States. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, aquaculture was touted by international development agencies as a way to provide food security to growing populations in developing countries. By the mid-1980s, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and other international aid agencies were pouring about $200 million into aquaculture projects each year.


By the 1990s, however, the dream of aquaculture began to resemble a nightmare of unsustainable growth.The rapid expansion of modern aquaculturemuch like agriculturehad taken its toll on the landscape and people. Demand for cheap seafood led to habitat destruction, with places like Thailand tearing up delicate mangrove forests on the coastline to replace with intensive shrimp farms. Monoculture fish farms were at risk for disease. Waste and pollution from fish farms leaked out into the ocean, causing dead zones where no other plants or sea life could survive.


One of the most glaring problems with aquaculture was the growing demand for farm-raised carnivorous fish, such as salmon, trout, and sea bass, which still relied on wild fish for feed. An influential study by economist Rosamund Naylor and biologist Harold A. Mooney showed that, although 29 million tons of finfish and shellfish were farmed worldwide in 1997, 10 million tons of wild fish were caught to feed them. ""It takes a lot of protein to produce protein,"" said Mooney. ""We're calling upon the aquaculture industry to create a better feed, one that uses fewer fish.""




Governments, researchers, and aquaculture farmers responded to this call. Reprocessing fish residues and byproducts into fishmeal, instead of using whole fish harvested from the ocean, is one option already in use. Plant-based feeds made from corn or soy can be coated in fish oil or fishmeal so that the carnivorous fish are tricked into a vegetarian diet. Recent trials have shown that soy and grain ingredients can serve as successful substitutesone NOAA study successfully replaced up to 70 percent of conventional black sea bass feed with a supplemented soybean meal, with no observed changes in fish health or size.


Even with the development of plant-based, rather than fish-based, feeds, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Using plants for aquaculture feeds still requires land to grow them. One study estimates that to produce enough feed for all Atlantic salmon from plant sources would require about 45 percent of the total agricultural area of Denmark.


Genetic engineering also presents the possibility for more efficient and sustainable aquaculture. The genetically modified AquAdvantage salmon incorporates a growth hormone from a Chinook salmon into an Atlantic salmon, enabling it to grow to full size in half the time and using 25 percent less feed.


Aquaculture is not perfect, but improvements to the industrys techniquesaccelerated by government supportsuggest that Cousteaus dream is slowly being fulfilled. Four years ago, the first type of farm-raised salmon was given a Best Choice rating from the Seafood Watch, meaning it was farmed in ways that cause little harm to habitats or other wildlife.


Today, dozens of kinds of farmed fish enjoy that top rating.


However, sustainable aquaculture is still largely limited to developed countries, while unsustainable practices still dominate in places with less regulatory oversight. Disease spread and habitat destruction remain central, and related, problems: Rapidly-spreading viruses have decimated monoculture Asian shrimp farms, and illegal dumping from shipping containers in U.S. waters could help spread disease. The losses caused by disease exacerbate habitat loss: One study found that Thai shrimp farmers would often just abandon a shrimp farm if it was decimated by disease, moving on to clear new mangrove forest and start over.


Untreated wastewater also remains a key environmental problem for aquaculture, with excess nitrogen and phosphorus leaching into oceans and ponds and choking the existing ecosystems. But aquaculture farmers are starting to implement innovative solutions to the wastewater problem as well: Seaweed and some shellfish like mussels can thrive on the nutrients discharged by farmed fish. By creating a multiorganism environment that mimics the ocean, farmers can produce another marketable product and remove environmentally damaging excess nutrients.


If done properly, aquaculture could become the best option for fish fansbut consumers will need to embrace it. Fish raised on new alternative feeds will have to taste the same for them to be widely accepted. Controversy over the genetically modified salmon means it has yet to reach market, despite FDA approval. Although farm-raised fish are already widely available in supermarkets, some consumers still prefer wild fish because they seem more natural.


Additionally, there are some species of fish that are difficult to raise in captivity. Tuna, a favorite of sushi-lovers around the world, is perhaps the most famous example. A large, carnivorous species like the coveted bluefin tuna is difficult to breed in a controlled environment. However, extreme overfishing and continually rising demand have led researchers in Tokyo to develop the worlds first farmed bluefin, called the Kindai. You can taste it at French Laundry or the Ritz, if you can afford it.


As chefs and consumers pay more attention to the consequences of overfishing, farmed fish are coming into the mainstream. The United States and other developed countries are leading the way to a future where all aquaculture can be conducted sustainably and can relieve pressure on ocean ecosystems and dangerously overfished species. In the not-too-distant future, when you see farmed salmon on the menu, you might worry that its actually wild.

In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies inJackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion thatour trust in her was misplaced.The magazine did not elaborate on the new information but the Washington Post, which has essentially been re-reporting the story since it broke last month, and representatives for the Virginia chapter of the fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, started providing the details.

Slate,L,Tech internship salaries: An even longer list that will make your eyes water,"Last month, I posted a brief list of tech internship salaries that had been bouncing around the Web, setting off a wave of self-loathing among those of us who decided to do something with our lives other than code. Now, the folks over at BetaBeat havepublished a much longer ""master list,"" as they put it, compiled with the help of Dan Zhang, a Ph.D. student studying computer architecture at the University of Texas. Along with fellow computer science students at Texas and the University of Michigan, Zhang surveyed members ofHackathon Hackers, ""a 9000+ member Facebook group for some of the countrys most talented college-age coders,"" as BetaBeat puts it, and ultimately got 183 responses. They've put together a great interactive chart, as well as the graph below of the 30 companies that offer the highest base pay to software development engineering interns. Dropbox: It's nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you spend an inordinate chunk of your teen years playing with code.

Like I said last time, I generally think it's a good thing that companies are paying their interns on par with full-time employees (remember, some of these kids are getting housing stipends, bonuses, and other benefits on top of pay). For that, I got chewed out by Samantha Allen at the Daily Beast, who argued that these salary packages were one more example of how the tech world's labor practices are perpetuating inequality. Her argument was a bit long, but in essence, she points out that companies like Facebook hire outside contractors to drive their shuttle buses or work in their cafeterias, and often, those contractors don't pay their employees very well. She rages: ""To bestow six figure salaries on interns before taking on contract workers as employees or, at least, raising their wages, sends a clear message to those who do the tech industrys grunt work: your wellbeing is our lowest priority.""

I'm all for Silicon Valley paying service workers more money. But singling out rank-and-file tech workers, and interns no less, seems a bit strange, given what we know about the ways companies like Apple and Google attempted to fix wages with agreements not to poach each other's employees in the past. We should want tech behemoths and startups competing hard with each other for talent. And high internship salaries are one sign that they're doing just that.

Slate,L,"Johnny Manziel, Kerrville: Even in the town where he learned to play the game, Johnny Football is polarizing.","From mid-September through most of November, Johnny Manziel accomplished something totally unexpected: He disappeared. Sure, during that time the Cleveland Browns quarterback offered to mentor fellow Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston, was criticized for laughing on the sidelines when his team was losing, and suggested the NCAA allow players to charge money for their autographs. But given Johnny Footballs history, this pretty much constituted a media blackout.

This is a guy who, in the two-plus years hes been a figure of national renown, posed for a shirtless mugshot after getting arrested for his part in a bar fight, was allegedly kicked out of a frat party at a rival school, and had his parents publicly fret that he had a drinking problem. He was suspended for the first half of a game at Texas A&M for selling his signature only to return and flash the money sign after scoring a touchdown in the second half. Reports emerged that he showed up late to Peyton Mannings football camp because he was hungover (Manziel denied it), and he was photographed in a Las Vegas bathroom rolling up money the way one might for, er, recreational use.


In the midst of all this, Manziel found time to become the most exciting quarterback in college football, win the Heisman, and get picked in the first round of the NFL draft. On the other hand, he lasted until the 22nd pick, with one anonymous scout telling Bleacher Reports Mike Freeman that he was paying for being a cocky asshole. Prior to the draft, a poll claimed that 70 percent of Browns fans didnt want the team to pick Manziel. A few months later, before hed taken a single snap, he had the NFLs best-selling jersey. Thats Johnny Manziel: You either cant help but love him or you want him as far away from your team as possible.



Before I got to town, I assumed Id find the most passionate Johnny Football fans on Earth. A 10-foot-high bronze statue didnt seem out of the question.



    Advertisement




For a few months, though, the NFLs most polarizing player was sitting on the bench, not doing anything that anyone might have an opinion about. That changed a couple of weeks ago. First, Manziel was involved in some kind of hotel scuffle. While a police report describes a riot with 20 people involved, Manziel said he was out to dinner with his mom when he was accosted by an unruly fan. Then, this past weekend in Buffalo, New York, Johnny Football came on in relief of a struggling Brian Hoyer, scoring on a scrambling 10-yard touchdown run on his first NFL drive. The Browns lost, and Cleveland coach Mike Pettine has declared that Hoyer is still the starter. But Manziel is back in the mix, and back at the center of a controversy, albeit this time an on-field one.


Manziel is easy to defend. Hes a 21-year-old enjoying himself in the way 21-year-olds do. He hasnt broken any lawsor at least he hasnt broken that many lawsand his decision-making hasnt seemed to affect his level of play. Considering everything thats wrong with football in general and the NFL specifically, Manziels antics might seem harmless, almost quaint.


Thats the argument I expected to hear when I drove down to Kerrville, Texas, in August to see where the legend of Johnny Football began. Manziel moved to this city of roughly 23,000 people, an hour north of San Antonio, when he was in middle school. A few years later, before the rest of America had heard his name, he put together one of the best seasons in the history of Texas high school football. The man asked to save the Cleveland Browns from mediocrity, the first player to win the Heisman Trophy in his freshman season, learned the game in Kerrville.


Before I got to town, I assumed Id find the most passionate Johnny Football fans on Earth. A 10-foot-high bronze statue didnt seem out of the question. But thats not what I found.

I caught Karla Dietz in her last week working at the Kerrville Visitor Center. Dietz, who has the friendly, straightforward demeanor of Friday Night Lights Tami Taylor, told visitors about the various museums and outdoor activities that Kerrville has to offer. Handing out bits of Johnny Manziel trivia was not part of her job description.


He wasnt a local, Dietz said. He came to go to school and to play football and he got out.


The Manziels moved to Kerrville in the mid-2000s, and Johnny went off to Texas A&M in 2011. Now, there are no Manziels left in town. Driving into Kerrville, there is no Home of Heisman Winner Johnny Manziel sign. [Locals] arent necessarily stuck in their ways, but they are totally OK with the way the town is, Dietz told me. They dont care about [his] fame or fortune. They want Kerrville to be known for other things.


As Dietz discussed the years when Manziel played for Tivy High, her co-worker chimed in. I heard he was a jerk, she said on her way back from the copy machine. My son-in-law went to school with him. She then went back to typing on her computer.


I truly believe if he had been born and raised here it would be different, Dietz said. You might see more signs with his name on it.

Kerrville isnt a one-stoplight townthere are actually several. But drive down Main Street for a few minutes and youve made it from one end to the other. Everyone who lives here is keen on saying its a great place to raise a family. The Guadalupe River runs through the city, providing a venue for kayaking and inner-tubing. There are a bunch of great spots for hunting, and plenty of churches for the many seniors who call Kerrville home.


According to the Kerrville Independent School District, 58 percent of the citizens are considered economically disadvantaged. There arent many white-collar jobs. The upscale Comanche Trace golf community, where the Manziels lived, is an outlier here.


I met Shauna Bullis outside ReRuns Resale, the thrift shop where she works a few blocks off Main Street. Bullis, who was out in the 100-degree heat painting a store rack, will turn 36 in January. She has lived in Kerrville for her first 35 years, graduating from Tivy High School more than a decade before Manziel arrived. People like to say hes from Kerrville, but hes really not, Bullis said. Hes from Tyler. I like to say, the bad things come from Tyler, and the footballthat comes from here. He learned football in Kerrville.




Bullis, a die-hard Tivy Antlers supporter, doesnt deny Manziels talents. After all, he took Tivy to two state semifinals, throwing for 76 touchdowns in his high school career and running for 77 more. At the same time, Bullis credits great coaching staffs for the consistent success of the Tivy program. Johnny Football, she believes, got as much from Tivy as Tivy got from Johnny Football.


Bullis doesnt have a lot of patience for Manziels carousing. He needs to calm down, or hell lose everything, she told me. Its worth noting that many Kerrville residents know someone battling drug or alcohol addiction. Kerr County is home to the La Hacienda Treatment Center, a prominent drug and alcohol rehab facility. People from all over Texas travel to this area to get clean. Ive always said that God will spank you, Bullis said. If you are doing the wrong things, it will come back around to you.

Antler Stadium is where Johnny Manziel broke nearly every quarterback record in school history. This summer, the facility got a major makeover after voters approved a $6.2 million bond. The Tivy High School Athletic Booster Club also chipped in for a new digital scoreboard. Sponsors dont pay for a scoreboard with few points on it, Coach David Jones told reporters in August. Well take care of that. Well be able to train athletes in one of the finest facilities in the Hill Country.



Theres a bit of irony to a high school junior calling an NFL quarterback just a kid.



Jones took over as head coach two years after Manziel graduated. After a three-hour practice, he told me that Tivys football culture predates Johnny Football. The kids that play for Tivy grew up here. Their parents are from Kerrville, and their grandparents are from Kerrville. The kids feel the tradition. That tradition is embodied in the slogan Tivy Fight Never Dies. Those are the words Manziel used to pay homage to his alma mater during his Heisman acceptance speech.


Jones said hes only met Manziel once, at a welcome-back ceremony held by the school. He told me that Manziel was nothing but respectful. There was this picture of my two young children that he had seen and asked their names, Jones said. When he saw me with them he said hello and called them by name. I was impressed by that and by him.


Nonetheless, Jones will admit that Manziel isnt perfect. Look, obviously itd be better if he piped down and didnt act up as much as he does, but hes not really doing anything that should convince people hes a bad guy.


Jones has big aspirations for Tivy in the post-Manziel era. Our ultimate goal every year, he told me, is to win a state championship. Hes got practices to run, players who need to be prepared for the season. Given that, Theres no time to dwell on Johnny.

The quarterback who Jones is focused on is Cade Dyal, a junior with some big shoes to fill. They arent Manziels shoes, though. Theyre his fathers. Mike Dyal, who graduated from Tivy in 1984, played tight end for the Antlers. He eventually spent a few years in the NFL with the Raiders, Chiefs, and Chargers. After he retired from pro football, he came back to Kerrville. He is the owner of Dyal Custom Homes, the family business that Cade might be a part of one day.


The Dyal name comes with a lot of expectations in Kerrville. Ive definitely always wanted to be the starting quarterback at Tivy, Cade told me. Born and raised in Kerrville, he was in seventh grade during Manziels senior year, when the Tivy QB threw for 44 touchdowns, ran for 30 more, and accounted for more than 5,000 yards of total offense. Johnny Football was great, his successor at quarterback says, but he didnt turn Kerrville residents into football fanaticsthat had happened a long time before the Manziels came to town. He helped out in terms of other towns, Dyal said. Like we got more attention outside of Kerrville, and with the college scouts. But he didnt add much here in town. Football has always been big here.


Dyals opinion on Manziels persona mirrored that of his coach. He might say a lot of stuff or do a lot of stuff, but its all pretty much stuff that kids all over the place are doing. He just has a magnifying glass over him because of all the success hes had.  Hes just a kid wanting to have fun.


Theres a bit of irony to a high school junior calling an NFL quarterback just a kid. Regardless, Dyal expects big things for Manziel. Honestly, hell be good anywhere. Hes got that special something that makes him good no matter where he is.


For his part, Dyal has 37 touchdown passes this season, just seven shy of Manziels mark from four seasons ago. This week, hell lead Tivy against Cedar Park in the state quarterfinals. As I talked to Dyal before the season started, another player exited the locker room and passed by on his way to the parking lot. This guy is a superstar, his sweat-drenched teammate said. Make sure you write that down.

On the bookshelf across from Jamie Fails desk is a framed picture of the school administrator posing with Manziel. It was taken at Tivys welcome-back ceremony, which Fails organized. A public relations specialist for the Kerrville Independent School District, shes exactly the type of Johnny Football supporter I thought Id find when I came to Kerrville.


Fails, who was teaching second grade when Manziel played for Tivy High, looks back fondly at the excitement he brought to town. There was very much a feel of, everybody wanted to go see Johnny play on Friday nights, she said.


The excitement spiked even higher when he went to A&M, Fails explained. People went to the local restaurants to watch games and cheer. Especially when they had the Heisman ceremony. That night, she remembered, there were cars honking and people yelling and celebrating out in the streets.




Fails saw a sense of pride in Kerrville over everything Manziel accomplished. Kids said they wanted to be like Johnny. PE teachers gave prizes if kids wore Manziel shirts.


Then she gave me what I had come to town expecting: excuses. The sense she got from everyone who taught him was that he might have missed a few classes here and there, but he always got his work done and he was always a leader. When he left town, though, his life changed drastically. I know there was an adjustment period [in college].  Then he went and saw Drake, and he took his advice and said, Im going to embrace it and use my talents and my face to get the word out to kids that they can be whatever they want to be and follow their dreams. In Tivy, the operative abbreviation is TFND, Tivy Fight Never Dies. For Manziel, YOLO might be more fitting.


I got the sense that Fails, a friendly, sincere woman, was talking honestly about someone she was proud of and whom she genuinely liked. Then again, she is a PR specialist.

He acted like a kid, and people got mad, said Gene Rhodes, who was sitting at the Guadalupe River Club bar with his wife. But if those people traced their own history, theyd remember they did all the same stuff theyre criticizing him for. The elderly Rhodes polished off his beer and stood up to leave. Too many Bible thumpers in this town. We got 200 churches and two or three bars. Thats all some of those people want to do is judge people.



People defend Manziel, and people criticize him. Its the same in the town where he became a football star.



Kyle McCormick, the bartender, went to high school with Manziel and was a backup lineman on the Tivy team his junior year. As soon as I started asking him about his former teammate, six or seven more men piped up. The discussion wasnt directed at anyone in particularit was a Johnny Manziel peanut gallery, buzzing in the background. 


Whats-his-name said he never went to class.


He was great here, McCormick said hesitantly. What he could do on the football field was amazing.


Well, hes an athlete. He didnt have to go to class. They have different rules than humans.


McCormick seemed to be looking for a way to hedge what he was about to say. Look, when youre only told youre the best, then you can only stay humble for so long.


His family was millionaires. Howd you expect him to act?


How many people can say they went to school with a Heisman winner? My picture is on the same page as his in the yearbook. I asked the bartender how Manziel was to be around. Look, he probably wasnt any different than a lot of high school quarterbacks in terms of the way he acted, McCormick said. Everything was more extreme with him because he was better than other high school quarterbacks.

But McCormick wasnt willing to explain everything away. Its justthe way he treated people. He thought he was better than them. On the football field he was. Then he picked up a glass to clean.


The kid did put Kerrville on the map for a while.


Im happy for him on the football field, McCormick concluded. Thats about it.


* * *


What I learned in Kerrville is what you already know: Johnny Manziel is polarizing. I thought it would be different here. It isnt. From California to New York, people defend Manziel, and people criticize him. Its the same in the town where he became a football star.




The reason it was so hard to find someone in Kerrville saying, Johnny Manziel is one of us, is because hes not. Hes a kid from out of town who came and played football, then left. Maybe its different now that the NFL season has started and Johnny Football is threatening to crack Clevelands starting lineup. But when I was in town, it took me 15 minutes in Gibsons five-and-dime to turn up the only piece of Manziel memorabilia I found for sale in all of Kerrville. In the college merchandise section, hanging below a few Texas A&M coffee mugs, was a single Johnny Football decal.

Theres no statue of Johnny Manziel in Kerrville, no sign declaring that this is where the Heisman winner learned to scramble around the pocket. In two days of looking, that decal was the only place I saw his name.

Slate,L,Republicans divided on immigration: Ted Cruz accuses Republicans of breaking campaign promises,"Republicans had a rare, fleeting moment of consensus on immigration when the president announced last month that he would take executive action to defer deportation and give work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Republicans of all stripesfrom the big-business-friendly speaker of the House to the Gadsden flag-toting Tea Party darlings in the rank-and-fileall agreed that his move was an unconstitutional overreach and an assault on our constitutional system of checks and balances. In that moment, Republicans called an intra-caucus cease-fire.

That cease-fire is toast. Ten Republicans broke ranks on Thursday to vote against or simply vote present on a largely symbolic bill introduced by Rep. Ted Yoho intended to block the presidents executive action on immigration. One Republican member, Arizonas Rep. Matt Salmon, mocked the bill a few hours before the vote, telling a group of reporters that the House could save time and money by just sending the president a Hallmark card.



The Republican intra-caucus ceasefire on immigration is toast.



The central question is this: Should Republicans try to use the appropriation process to defund the presidents immigration move? Supporters of that strategyincluding Sens. Jeff Sessions and Ted Cruz, as well as Salmon and othersargue its the only way to keep the presidents action from going forward. Opponents of that strategy tremble at the prospect of replaying last years government shutdown.


    Advertisement




But the strategys supporters have been vocal and unequivocal about their positions. And now theyre going on the offense. Sessions released a statement suggesting that a plan some Republicans had been coalescing aroundto pass Rep. Yohos hallmark card bill and then fund the government without any exception for the presidents immigration movewould break the partys campaign promises. 


In fact, a few days before the midterm elections, Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus told reporters on a conference call that the GOP would spare no effort to block the presidents move.


We will do everything we can to make sure it doesnt happen: Defunding, going to court, injunction, he said, per Breitbart. You name it. Its wrong. Its illegal.


So Republicans are in a tough spot: The chairman of their party promised that defunding would be on the table if necessary, but now the House Leadership seems thoroughly uninterested in that route. Its one thing to rally the base in late October, but its quite another to follow up on a commitment that could precipitate a second government shutdown.


So would Republicans be breaking their campaign promises if they voted to fund the government without any provision blocking funds for the presidents immigration action?


It depends on who you ask. At a press conference yesterday, Iowas Rep. Steve King said that members of Congress who vote to fund the presidents move would be voting to violate the Constitution and, thus, would violate their oaths of office. Cruz warned that members should do what you promised.


And doing what you promised doesn't mean, as it so often does in Washington, sending a really stern letter and having a meaningless show vote,"" he added.


Later I asked Salmon if he thought members who voted for a funding bill that included funding for the presidents move would be breaking their campaign promises. He echoed Cruzs message that it would be a violation of their oath of office.


I think that its an abdication of your duty to vote for funding for something that you believe is unconstitutional, he said. Absolutely. Even for a day.


There obviously isnt a consensus in Republican ranks on that. Michigans Rep. Candice Miller, who chairs the House Administration Committee, was blunt.


For anybody to say that if you just dont vote the way he thinks, that youre breaking your campaign promise, I think is wrong, she said.


And Rep. Bill Cassidy who is all but a lock to win the Louisiana Senate race on Dec. 6, was in the same camp as Miller.


Im not sure I accept Sen. Sessions assessment, he said.

Eisenhower was successful in the Battle of the Bulge, Cassidy continued, because he waited to counterattack.


So theres a certain strategy that must come in to play, he concluded. And so I think that this is a little bit of a chess match, and you have to do your actions with an eye towards completing them in success.


Off the hill, conservatives are a touch less delicate. Radio host Laura Ingraham, one of the most influential voices opposing comprehensive immigration reform, said on her radio show Thursday that she has started looking for someone to primary Kentuckys Rep. Hal Rogers. Rogers chairs the House Appropriations Committee and drew enormous ire for saying that defunding the presidents move wouldnt be possible.


And Erick Erickson, who runs RedState.com, encouraged readers to mail blue balls to Boehners district office in Ohio. At about noon on Thursday, he celebrated more than 100 orders to Boehners office.


So yes, this could get ugly.

The New Yorker,L,New Jobs Figures Worth Celebrating - The New Yorker,"

 


As you may have heard, the economy added three hundred and twenty-one thousand jobs in November. That was a much larger figure than analysts were expecting, and it prompted President Obama to take a lap of honor around the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Well, not quite, but he didbring up the employment figuresduring a ceremony to announce his choice for the new Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter, and who can blame him?  For months now, it has been clearthat theres a disconnect between the Presidents approval rating on domestic issues and whats actually happening to the economy. (Iwrote about thisback in October.) With the Labor Departments latestemployment reportalso showing tentative signs of a rise in wages, the White House will be hoping that public perception starts to catch up with reality. It has been a long road to recovery from the worst economic crisis in generations, and we still have a lot more work to do to,Obama said. But its worth us, every once in a while, reflecting on the fact that the American economy is making real progress. Its dangerous to read too much into a single months figuresthe payroll numbers bounce around, theres a good deal of statistical uncertainty to them, and they always get revised (twice). But if you look beyond this monthsheadline figure and set politics aside, the underlying trends are encouraging. While the economy still hasnt fully recovered from the Great Recession, itsfinally growing at a rate above its long-term trend of about 2.5 per cent. (In the latest quarter, the growth rate was 3.9 per cent, according to the Commerce Department.) Thats whats supposed to happen during recoveries. Rapid G.D.P. growth generates big job gains, bids up wages, and draws discouraged workers back into the labor force. During this recovery, which began way back in 2009, we havent seen anything like that sort of growth. But now, finally, it appears to be happening. The November report isnt a one-off. Since September, the economy has added about two hundred and eighty thousand jobs a month, on average. That represents a significant step up from the previous nine months, when the monthly payrolls figure averaged about two hundred and ten thousand. Over time, job gains of this nature add up to substantial gains in over-all employment. In the past two years, the total number of people employed in the non-farm sector of the U.S. economy, which means the great majority of the economy, has risen from 134.9 million to slightly more than a hundred and forty million. Thats a big jump. During the same period, the unemployment rate hasfallen from 7.8 per cent to 5.8 per cent. Somewhat surprisingly, it remained steady last month, reflecting the fact that it is based on a survey different from the one that generates the payroll figures. (The payroll numbers come from a survey of firms; the jobless numbers come from a survey of households.)But the trend in the jobless rate is clearly downward. At some point, if the unemployment rate keeps falling, employers will find it more difficult to hire workers, and they will be forced to offer higher wages. Thats what happened in the late nineteen-nineties, which was the last time American workers saw their inflation-adjusted earnings rise in any appreciable fashion. AfterFridays figures came out, somenews accountssuggested that the moment when wages take off might be upon us. The report showed that average hourly earnings went from $24.57 in October to $24.66 in Novemberan increase of about 0.37 per cent. Thats good news, but nine cents is just nine cents. Among production and non-supervisory employeesi.e., ordinary working stiffsthe increase in hourly earnings was even smaller: just four cents, in fact. At this stage, its premature to suggest that the long period of wage stagnation is over. Before we could be sure that wages are outstripping inflation, wed need to see sizable gains being sustained over several months, or longer. As the Wall Street Journals Damian Paletta pointed out, weve seen such rises before, and theyve turned out to be blips. Still, the uptickin wages is a hopeful sign. And so is the fact, highlighted by Jason Furman, the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, that at least some of the expansion in payrolls istaking place in industries that pay decent wages. Employment in manufacturing rose by twenty-eight thousand in November, and the financial sector added twenty thousand new positions. As always, there are caveats. A sizable proportion of the employment gains came in retailing and food services, where wages tend to be low and some of the hiring may have been seasonal. But, all in all, the new jobs report was a very positive one, and its worthy of some pre-Christmas celebration.

The New Yorker,L,In and Out of Time in Iraq - The New Yorker,"

 

The Cheat River, c. 1967. 
Credit Photograph by John Dominis/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty								 


I fell out of time in the summer of 2004. I fell back in about seven years later, on September 11, 2011. The first fall was slow, more of a slide than a drop. It began as I moved around Baghdad, in the summer of 2003, with a growing sense of unease. On Memorial Day, while reporting for the Washington Post, I went on a 1stInfantry Division patrol in western Baghdad with anotherPostreporter, Anthony Shadid. I talked to members of the patrol, while Anthony talked to the Iraqis in the neighborhood. Everybody likes us, Spec. Stephen Harris, then twenty-one years old, told me. Anthony heard a different story. We refuse the occupation, Mohammed Abdullah, a thirty-four-year-old Iraqi, told him. Theyre walking over my heart. I feel like theyre crushing my heart. (Anthony, who had been shot in Israel, in 2002, and was kidnapped in Libya, in 2011, died while covering the rebellion in Syria in 2012.)  The rest of2003 brought a series of bombings in Baghdadof the United Nations office, of foreign embassies, of the Red Crossthat clearly were designed to peel away potential allies from the United States. (The U.S. responded to these attacks with flailing and with moral errors, such as the torture of prisonersand not just at Abu Ghraib.) In the spring of 2004, there simultaneously was a Shiite uprising on one side of Baghdad and a Sunni one west of the city, in Fallujah. Yet, the Americans seemed to think that all that was needed was a positive attitude. In the back of my brain, an unconscious thought was growing, whispering, insisting on being heard: something is very wrong here. It hit me hard; it was a personal feeling. This wasnt a matter of policy, this was a matter of my life: This war is going to be very different from the other conflicts you have covered, I thought, different from Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan. Something here has grabbed ahold of you. You have lost control of your future. For reasons that I still dont understand, my mental elevator-ride down accelerated on a trip home in early August, 2004. It began with a daylong flight on an Air-Force C-130 Hercules cargo plane. We flew from Baghdad, but, instead of going directly south to Kuwait, we first went north to Mosul, then sat on the hot runway for what felt like three or four hours. It was probably about a hundred and twenty degrees inside the plane. We took off dripping in sweat, froze in our wet T-shirts while in the air, and finally landed in Kuwait City late at night. Kuwait brought an unhappy bureaucratic surprise. Because I had arrived on a U.S Air Force plane, I did not needor havean entry visa. But I was flying out commercially, and for that I needed an exit visa. Yet, I was informed at the airport that one could not be given to me because I was not officially in Kuwaitthat is, there was no stamp in my passport. I hired a Pakistani taxi driver to help me make the rounds of government offices. The Kuwaiti officials seemed to delight in tormenting me. The cab driver, seeing my face as I emerged from the third Kuwaiti office of the day, said to me, sympathetically, Sir, I told you these guys was sons of bitches. He shook his head. I felt awful, panicky, as if the walls were closing in. Looking back now, I realize that all this bothered me more than it should have. On the British Airways flight from Heathrow to Washington, the stewards, half on strike, were a bit rude, but it felt like they were poking me with sticks. When I got home, my house was in turmoila much-needed renovation was underway. It all seemed like a conspiracy to make my life more difficult. When my wife handed me an avocado-and-tomato sandwich for dinner, it tasted like ashes. I left to go whitewater kayaking on the Youghiogheny and Cheat Rivers in West Virginia, a few hours west of Washington, D.C. I paddled hard for five days. On the sixth day, I was tired. On that final day, I was near the takeoutthat is, the end of the river tripwhen I came to the last hard rapid in the Cheat Canyon, where a three-foot-long pillar of rock juts out like a thumb from a clenched fist, angled over a small waterfall. At this Class IV rapid, I should have taken a right stroke, to edge the boat a bit to the left. I had been through this rapid a dozen or more times before and had executed that move successfully each time. Instead, this time, inexplicably, I took a left stroke, and the kayak shifted ever so slightly to the right. At the drop, my bow leaned off more toward the right, propelling my torso into the edge of the rock projection. It hit me so hard in my ribs that I felt almost lifted out of the boat, even though I was wearing a tight, heavy, rapid-proof sprayskirt. Just writing about it brings back an ache in my ribs. Ive never quite known why that accident happened. But I wonder now if it wasnt completely unintentional. I was able to paddle to the takeout but awoke the next morning barely able to get out of bed. I rolled out onto my knees, eventually rose to my feet, and drove home, where I had a deeply irrational argument with my wife. I blamed all that was happening on others. I felt that people were really pissing me off and that they just needed to listen to me more. That was my low pointthe late summer and early fall of 2004. I was in bad mental shape but did not know it. The best thing I could have done, I think, was to get some therapy. I didnt. But I did the second-best thing: I withdrew from reporting for a year to write a book about the Iraq war. From the start, I knew I would call it Fiasco. I was beginning to sense that I had undergone some serious changes. One day in the course of my research I was reading some news stories I had written in the fall of 2004, and I realized that I had no memory of writing them. This was very unusual for meusually, I can look back at a story years later and recall conversations with sources and editors. But this sheaf of stories from November and December, 2004, were just blanks to me. That puzzled me then, and it still does now. Still, I had a lot of energy and needed to let it out. I began writing the book in January, 2005, and finished it that December; it came in at just under five hundred pages. After typing the last words, I walked downstairs to where my wife was working on her own book and told her that I was done. She asked if I was happy with it. I said that I didnt care if it didnt sell a single copy. I had written what I had set out to say. Yet, contrary to what I had hoped, or even expected, seeing Fiasco get publishedand become a best-sellerbrought no sense of resolution. I could not put Iraq away. I was shackled to the subject. Iraq and its aftermath ran my life for several more years. I wrote another book on the subject, titled The Gamble. I consumed too much alcohol, and still do. I think I was a bit numb at times. For several years, until about 2010, my nights were spent in a mental box. My dreams were almost always of confrontation and frustration. Then there were those black dreamsI would sometimes jolt awake at night, dripping in sweat, fingernails digging into my palms, yet never be able to remember the nightmare. I grew to hate being in the same room as a loud television, especially if it was playing cable news or reality showsit just felt like having shit thrown at me from across the room. I had long loved watching baseball, but I stopped going to Major League Baseball games because I had begun to find the stadium din, especially the blare of the loudspeakers, to be exhausting. In fact, I was always exhausted. I craved bland foodmashed potatoes, pasta, yogurtto calm my churning stomach. Time came and went. I knew that my wife and two children, now adults, would pay a price for my changed behavior. The moment of recognition came for me when a marriage counselor read aloud from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders the symptoms of P.T.S.D., among them irritability, nightmares, hyper-vigilance, and feelings of disconnection. He then looked at me and asked if these sounded familiar. Over time I did better with my wife, which, oddly enough, enabled me to withdraw from the world a bit. For years, I had known that the only way to enjoy working in Washington, D.C. is to keep in mind that it is a pageant of power, Shakespearean at times. But, after 2004, I no longer enjoyed the game, mainly because the Rumsfeldian contumely, the shenanigans of ideologues, and the short-term memories of clownish officials were all getting people killed in a mindless war. So, a few years later, when a generous buyout offer came from thePost, I accepted it. We moved to an old sea captains house on an island well up the Maine coast, several hours past Portland. There, I set to work on my next book and, more importantly, on trying to relearn how to live. On September 11, 2011, I knew that I needed to observe the grim tenth anniversary in some way. I decided that the best thing to do would be to kayak, alone, up a remote sea cove on Cape Rosier, on the east side of Penobscot Bay, in east Maine. Nothing major happened that day, but, even so, it would change me. I would emerge reconnected to time, but in a way different from before. This arm of the sea, called Horseshoe Cove, begins near open waters, where the bay meets Eggemoggin Reach. But, as you move north, it narrows and begins to feel more like a river, hemmed in by granite banks topped by stands of spruce and fir. Then, at the end, the water opens out to what feels like a small, remote lake. But it is salt water, so twice a day the current reverses, and the small rapids that had pointed north slacken and begin to flow south. It was a bright, sunny morning, not unlike 9/11, ten years earlier. But this was Maine, so on this September day there was an autumn chill in the air that made it comfortable to stay in the sun, and away from the shadows. For about thirty-five minutes, I paddled up the cove, the swift current of the flood tide urging along my sea kayak, a high-bowed, eighteen-foot-long craft made of Kevlar. At the salt lake, I crossed to the north side and beached my boat on a granite ledge. I sat in the midday sun and ate my turkey sandwich and my Fuji apple. Then I lay back in the sunlight on the long, dry pine needles. I didnt sleep, but I closed my eyes. I felt the beginning of a sense of peace. This certainly was not a sense of satisfaction; it was more like acknowledging to myself, O.K., thats done, time to move on. But what stays with me most from that day is what happened next. Watching the water rise to the debris of the wrack line, I judged that the high tide was about to peak, so I got back into the boat. But when I got to the south end of the lake, I found that at the river-like section the water was still flowing in. The inward current was so strong that I could not ascend it, so I pulled up onto a flat granite boulder and sat waiting for the tide to turn. I was surprised that it took perhaps another forty-five minutes before the water slowed, flattened, and finally reversed. It was such a quiet process that it felt like watching a secret unfold. Looking back on it now, I think that, when the rapid disappeared, it took some of my pain with it. At the beginning of the ebb tide, I got back into the kayak and paddled homeward, back to the mouth of Horseshoe Cove. This was all non-verbal, which I suspect is significant for someone who writes for a living and is intoxicated by words. Certain events had led me to a spot where I finally shut up and listened. I didnt mind the silence. There was so much to smell, feel, and hearthe conifers, the flowing saltwater, an occasional gull or osprey, the prospect of a passing seal. Why has that moment become so meaningful? Only now does the likely reason occur to me: I was unconsciously using that day to reset my sense of time. That is, I was ready once again to be in time, to be connected to its passage. But I was not ready to be tethered to the sort of time I had known. I was not going back to my old life, in which I rose to an alarm clock; ran to a series of interviews, press conferences, briefings, hearings; took nervous trips to war zones; and sometimes stumbled through Heathrow half-zonked on Ambien. That is, I was no longer working on deadline, as I had been since the early nineteen-eighties. Since that day on that boulder in midstream, I have been back in time but still off the clock. That is, my life to a surprising degree is attuned to natural time. I attend to the tides, the phases of the moon, the seasons, the shifting winds, and, most of all, the rising and setting of the sun. (And, yes, I dislike the human intrusion of daylight-saving time, which feels like the theft of an hour of sun a day.) Until I lived on an ocean island, I did not know that the full moon always rises around sunset. Now, I look forward to it. I hike when the tide is low, and my dog and I can cross sandbars to islands. I like to sail on the rising tide, when running aground is usually just a problem of waiting a few minutes to float off. My favorite month has become October, when the rays of the sun arrive almost horizontally, at times feeling like liquid gold poured across the water and woods. I have learned to read the weather, to know, for example, that, where I live, a wind out of the southeast almost always means fog or rain is on the way. I heed the saying that, Mackerel skies and mares tails / makewise menlower sails. When I write, I look out the window of my home officeat the harbor filling and emptying with the tide, and at the seabirds settling in to eat. Bald eagles come by in the winter, when they move in from the more exposed outer islands. I came to the realization that there had been those two moments, of falling out of time and returning to it, while reading David Morriss new history of P.T.S.D., The Evil Hours, which will be published in mid-January. One of the themes of his book is that the syndrome can warp ones sense of time, making weeks and months flash by while one remains partly mired in the past. This untethering from time is unsettling, because it is a persistent reminder that ones life is different from the people whom Morris calls the normals. P.T.S.D. is a disease of time, Morris writes. Nearly all survivors report that certain traumatic memories communicate an uncanny feeling of timelessness. (Not only does his experience intertwine with my own, so does his work. He mentions in the book that he gave a copy of Fiascoto his V.A. therapist in the hope of being better understood. I have never met him, but he thanks me in his acknowledgements. I read an advance copy of the book and was moved to blurbitand to write this essay.) Morris writes about his journey through P.T.S.D.I became a watcher of night skies, of cloud formations, of shooting stars. To my surprise, after that day on Cape Rosier, my love of sea kayaking waned. Instead, I got more into sailing, eventually buying my own small sloop. This is how I explain that move to myself: Whitewater kayaking is a sport of hyper-vigilance. You must pay attention at every moment, or you will wind up upside down, wet and in the dark. Sea kayaking requires constant mindfulness, especially in Maine, with its relatively lonely and cold waters, heavy fogs, ten-foot tides, and high afternoon winds on many summer days. Sailing is yet another rung down. Nature still promises nothing, so helming a small sloop still asks for monitoring, but it is made much more forgiving by a deep keel, an outboard motor, and a cabin packed with helpful gear. If worse comes to worst, I can turn on the motor and gun for home. Or if the weather is too forbidding for that, I can find the lee of an island, drop anchor, and go below to get some warm clothes, books, and food. To me, sailing on Penobscot River on a pleasant August day is the complete opposite of war. To my surprise, I also felt at home with the small island communitylobstermen, artists, engaged retirees. I feel more comfortable here than I ever did in Washington. On the evening of the summer solstice of 2013, I moored my sailboat in the Fox Islands Thoroughfare, one of the most beautiful places I know. I relaxed in the cockpit of the little sloop, drank a beer, and watched the full moon rise, pulling an unusual twelve-foot tide with it. It glowed pink and orange in the sunset. This was something I could trust. Nature might kill me, but it doesnt lie to me. Am I sorry about all this? No. Would I do it all again? I dont think so. But I did do it, and it is part of who I am. As Morris writes, We are our scars, it seems.

The New Yorker,L,Bar Tab: Kilo Bravo,"

 


Credit Illustration by Daniel Krall									 


I will believe it a good comfortable road until I am compelled to believe differently, Meriwether Lewis wrote as he and William Clark came upon the Rocky Mountains, in 1805. A similarly optimistic duo, having procured G-train reading material, struck out, two centuries later, for a new bar in Williamsburg. They found it most welcoming, with Giants tribesmenManning and Cruz, according to their battle garbcheering beneath a mounted gilt bison head. In addition to common brews and wines, this bar tendered fifty cocktails, one for each state. Like Lewis and Clark, our travellers began near St. Louis, with the aim of drinking westward, along the explorers trail. Keep in mind that part of doing a road trip is that some states suck, the barkeep cautioned. He deemed the Missouri Mule (bourbon, applejack, Cointreau, Campari) and Nebraskas Cornhusker (corn whiskey, vermouth) a couple of doozies. When asked for the President (South Dakota) and a spearminty, electric-blue Howlin Wolf (North Dakota), the tapper winced, declaring, I wouldve taken either of the first two over these. Yet the duo staggered on, as the vicious Seahawk people routed the Giants. The next stop was to be Montana, with its Tornadobourbon, gin, tequilamore deadly than a beaver bite, but our explorers toasted defeat with a Budweiser pounder, a homecoming to Missouri, of sorts."
The New Yorker,L,Wild and Mr. Turner Reviews,"

 

Reese Witherspoon stars in Wild, adapted from the book by Cheryl Strayed. 
Credit Illustration by Chang Park									 


Wild opens with a shot of majestic forested mountains and the sound of a woman breathing harder and harder, as if in sexual excitement. The woman, however, turns out to be a hiker, Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon), with a huge pack on her back, laboring to reach an exposed high place. When she gets there, she takes off her too-small boots, to reveal blackened toenails that are painfully loose. One of the boots falls into a canyon, and, with a curse, she throws the other after it. Wild is based on Strayeds autobiographical best-seller, published in 2012, seventeen years after her arduous trek, which she reconstructed in punishing and exhilarating detail. Her mother died in 1991, and Strayed, grief-stricken and lost, cheated on her devoted husband (played by Thomas Sadoski in the film), and, with one lover, fell into a heroin haze. In 1995, she walked eleven hundred miles, through desert, bush, and snowy mountains, from Mojave, California, to the Oregon-Washington border. Each stopping place in the wilderness is a kind of marker along the road to redemption. Sweating and freezing, Cheryl wants to expunge loss and self-disgust from her soul. The suggestion of sex at the start is part of the movies candid tone. One of the things that make Cheryl more complicated and compelling than the heroine of Tracks (this years earlier woman-schlepping-across-the-desert movie) is that, along the trail, she experiences every encounter with men as fraught with erotic possibilityor trepidation. (She has one happy meeting with a sinewy young man played by the Dutch actor Michiel Huisman.) Wild is about the renewal of self, but its a film made without sanctimony or piety. The English screenwriter and novelist Nick Hornby (About a Boy) adapted the book for the movie, which was directed by the French-Canadian Jean-Marc Valle (Dallas Buyers Club). Both men know that narrative art lives in small details woven through large emotions. Cheryls throwing the second shoe over the side suggests defiance and a willingness to endure pain and humiliation. (She makes shoes out of sandals and duct tape, which produce blister upon blister.) Valle focusses on the hikers obsession with the profound materiality of her existencenot just heat, rain, cold, snakes, and tiny crawling creatures but the complicated paraphernalia of food, water, stove, tent, animal-scaring whistle, and whatnot, all of which has to be packed and unpacked daily. Inexperienced Cheryl is as overloaded as a nineteenth-century American grand tourist embarking for Europe with too many steamer trunks. In photographs, Cheryl Strayed looks like a big-bodied woman, but Reese Witherspoon stands barely more than five feet, and when she first tries to pull on her monster pack it forces her to the ground. (The pack becomes something like a malevolent object in a Chaplin comedy.) Witherspoon doesnt have the muscular legs of a hiker, but she has a determined set to her jaw. From the beginning, with her startling performance as a ruthless high-school girl in Election (1999), she has played unstoppable young women. Her pink-candy-box periodthe two Legally Blonde moviesturned her all-conquering will into a profitable joke. But she has dropped that sort of calculation and, in addition to acting, become a formidable producer (shes part of the team that made Gone Girl). Here shes a good actress playing an intelligent, well-read, ambitious, but screwed-up woman. Strayed is enmeshed in literature, and her skillfully structured adventure tale is more expressive than the film. She keeps a journal, and the entries, as well as chance encounters, set off memories in the movie of her extraordinary mother (Laura Dern), her husband, and various other men. The memories flash by in mostly short scenessometimes a montage of single shotsand the device, which tries to keep us inside Cheryls head, becomes tiresome and far less satisfying than Strayeds more sustained written recollections. The scenery, of course, could stop the heart of a mountain goat, and Wild has an admirable heroine, but the movie itself often feels literal-minded rather than poetic, busy rather than sublime, eager to communicate rather than easily splendid. Watching Timothy Spalls performance as the finest of British painters, in Mike Leighs Mr. Turner (opening December 19th), you cant help but think that Dickens, in his many portraits of exuberant Englishmen, wasnt exaggerating. All the men in Mr. Turner bluster at one another, as if they were playing themselves onstage, but Spall outdoes everyone in heroic oddity and temper. The movie begins in 1826, when J. M. W. Turner, then fifty-one, is a famous man living a largely anonymous life. Sketchbook in hand, he walks alone and undisturbed along cliffs facing the sea, or in the Kentish port town of Margate, or in Holland, on a bluff, staring at the sun on the horizon. Spall has a small mouth that pulls up toward a shapeless nose, and eyes that are set close together, like those of a furtive animal. Its a face that repels examination; his Turner wants to see, not be seenor heard. When he speaks, indistinct syllables emerge from his throata half-dozen varieties of grunt, snarl, and roar. Spall has played angry men before, but, except for a brief appearance as Churchill, in The Kings Speech, he hasnt played angry great men. Beneath the snarling, hooded temperament, intellectual curiosity and a wide range of sympathies seethe and, occasionally, breach the surface. Mr. Turner is a harsh, strange, but stirring movie, no more a conventional artists bio-pic than Robert Altmans wonderful, little-seen film about van Gogh and his brother, Vincent and Theo. Like many such persons, Turner has an overwhelming desire to do exactly as he pleases. In his handsome but underdressed London house, he lives with his loving father and an adoring servant, whom he uses sexually, giving her not so much as a glance. Returning from a journey, he rushes to his studio in a back room and immediately sets to work. He sleeps in his clothes, makes art all day, wherever he is, and enjoys few pleasures. The bohemian scene doesnt exist for him. He has no special milieu except for a few aristocratic country houses, where hes an honored guest, and the Royal Academy, in London. He strides through its marble halls in a top hat, frock coat, and cravat, and challenges the other artists, including John Constable, with muttered remarks and such astonishing acts as disfiguring one of his own maritime paintings with a smudge of crimson. After disappearing for a while, he returns and wipes away half the wet paint, leaving a bobbing buoy. He later attacks a canvas like a proto Action painter. He stabs it with a brush, spits on it, and speckles it with handfuls of powdery substances. His top hat affords him the reputation of a gentleman, disguising sheer aggression with respectability. But Mr. Turner is no gentleman. Mike Leigh, whose Topsy-Turvy (1999) was an acridly entertaining portrait of Arthur Sullivan and W. S. Gilbert, never softens or explains. His people brush rudely past one another. The movie details, for instance, Turners encounters with the impecunious painter Benjamin Haydon, whose large historical canvases were no longer in fashion (or very good, according to Dickens). Haydon comes off as a self-dramatizing hotheadno gentleman, either, and, worse, unlike Turner, he cant fake composure when necessary. Leigh features him, I think, in order to remind us that not all possessed artists possess genius. A resilient but tough-minded attitude toward life and art rules the movie. Many of the people we see seem to be ill, and the death of children is a constant. Against this early-Victorian gloom, Turner, a modern sun god, floods his canvases with light. Obsessed with the meeting of land and sea, he suffuses everything with an effulgence of white, yellow, and ochre, and blurs the outlines of solid objects with a squiggly brush and a rag, anticipating the work of the Impressionists. Leigh and the cinematographer, Dick Pope, show people looking at the paintings more than they show the paintings themselves, which was wisethe work doesnt reproduce well onscreen. What the filmmakers can do, however, is re-create, with hard clarity, what it was that Turner saw. They appear to be saying, This is our way of looking. Photography is an art, too. Theres one sour notethe treatment of the critic John Ruskin, an early supporter of Turners and a great man in his own right, who comes off as a petted, fatuous, self-important young exquisite. Turner humors him (Ruskin and his parents were buyers), says teasing things to his notoriously neglected wife at a dinner party, and snorts when he sees some delicate pre-Raphaelite pictures (influenced by Ruskins writings) at the Royal Academy. The Ruskin portrayal is Leighs way of putting down critics who reduce an artists work to banal words. Yet Leigh, too, has had his share of appreciation by non-geniuses. I think Ill live."
The New Yorker,L,The Trouble With Cheap Oil - The New Yorker,"

 


Credit PHOTOGRAPH BY DANIEL ACKER/BLOOMBERG VIA GETTY								 


Just before the turn of the millennium, I met a man who had recently invested a fortune in wind power. He said he wanted to do all that he could to slow the course of climate change. He was also convinced that, as the world began to run out of oil, alternative sources of energy would offer a unique entrepreneurial opportunity. Oil prices will fluctuate for a while, he told me. But, eventually, they can only move in one direction. Up. Oil is a finite resource and, as supplies dwindle, the costs will have to rise. That will make alternatives like wind power much more attractive.  That sounded sensible, and, for the many people who have long argued that our addiction to oil and gas is destroying the planet, so did the much discussed concept of peak oilthe theoretical moment when half the worlds oil reserves had been consumed and fossil fuels began to become scarce. The date of peak oil is hard to pin down, but most suggest we passed that point a decade ago. In a Times column titled The Finite World, Paul Krugman said that the magic moment had arrived in 2010. High oil prices would force governments, corporations, and consumers to find another way to power the world. It was a nice dream, but its over now. We are awash in cheap oil. Propelled largely by a boom in domestic production, due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling, oil prices fell below $70 a barrel on Thursdayfrom a high in June of $112.12. Prices have fallen nearly every day for the past two months, and some economists predict that we will soon see oil selling for less than fifty dollars a barrel. Thats good news for consumers; it means that they will have more disposable income. More gas means more travel and more spending, which our sluggish economy clearly needs. But the costs may be enormous. In 2008, a barrel of oil cost $147, more than twice todays price. Many economists and geologists predict that prices are unlikely to rise again soon. Fracking technology has transformed the United States from an importer of gas and oil to an exporter. In fact, the International Energy Agency has predicted that the United States will produce more oil next year than Saudi Arabia; we might even pass Russia, which, at ten million barrels a day, is the worlds biggest producer. (We already produce more natural gas than Russia.) Fracking is not a magic fix, or even a benign one: the technology poses clear risks to the environment. It would be hard to make the case that it would be better to rely on Syria, Russia, Iraq, or Saudi Arabia to fuel the nation, as we have in the past. We have endured unpredictable oil prices since OPEC imposed an embargo on the U.S. soon after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. That punishment led to the first oil shock, and, since then, prices have been influenced by politics as much as by demand. But the cheaper fossil fuels become, the more challenging it will be for cleaner forms of energylike solar and wind powerto become competitive. Many environmentalists had assumed that if neither fear nor reason helped us to lessen our reliance on oil, then at least we could count on scarcity. But scarcity is not an economic or environmental policy. Humans have long had a habit of expecting the sky to fall. Yet from Malthus to Paul Ehrlich, predictions that the planet was on the verge of starvation have never come to pass (or at least not as broadly as expected). Nonetheless, the drop in oil prices comes at a terrible moment. Last month the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that our only chance to halt the rising temperature of the Earth, and to prevent the calamity that rise will cause, would be to eliminate fossil-fuel emissions by the end of the century. A plan to end U.S. fossil-fuel dependence would be an unlikely goal in any case, but, if oil remains easily accessible, it becomes politically impossible. It is technically feasible to transition to a low-carbon economy, Youba Sokona, the co-chair of one of the I.P.C.C.s working groups,says. But what is lacking are appropriate policies and institutions. The longer we wait to take action, the more it will cost to adapt and mitigate climate change. It seems churlish, at best, to lament easy access to one of the worlds most vital commodities. But cheap gas has become like an industrial form of crack. It doesnt really matter how much damage it causes, because we simply dont have the power to walk away.

The New Yorker,L,The Ride of Their Lives,"

 

Calf riders wait in the arena alley on the last day of the Youth Bull Riders World Finals, in Abilene, Texas. Rodeo bull riders learn as children by riding sheep, calves, and steers. Many ride their first bull before their teens. 
Credit Photographs by Jonno Rattman									 


Rodeo bulls, like the boys who dream of riding them, are unpredictable creatures. They can start out shy and skittish, then suddenly turn ornery. Theyll lie down in the chute one day and try to gore you the next. The most dangerous bull ever ridden, by some accounts, began as a scrawny yellow calf in 1988. Half Charolais and half Brahman, he was still long and bony at age three, but liable to turn fat and ungainly if his breeding held true. His owner, Phil Sumner, named him J31he wasnt sure the bull would live long enough to earn a real name. Sumner took him to a few scrubgrass rodeos in northern Oklahoma, but didnt see much fight in him. I was thinking, Dude, youre going to have to step up your game plan or youre going to be going to McDonalds, Sumner told me. Then one Sunday afternoon at a small arena outside of Okeene, Oklahoma, something in the bull snapped. The kid who was riding him got his hand caught in his rope. He was flopping around on J31s back, trying to dismount, when the bull suddenly went crazy beneath him. He leaped up and spun around, bucked forward and kicked back, his legs so high behind him that he almost flipped end over end. By the time the boy pulled free, the bull had nearly gone over the fence. It just freaked him out, Sumner said. Animals, as a rule, dont like to have other animals on their backs. They find it strange and distressingan attack or a violation, an act of dominance. This hasnt kept us from trying to ride them, of course. Horse, mule, donkey, camel, llama, yak, and elephantthe bigger the animal, the more likely we are to climb on top of it. People have sat on ostriches, orcas, alligators, and water buffalo, straddled giant tortoises, and set toddlers on St. Bernards. Their mounts may try to shake them off at first, but the contest is an unequal one, and they tend to knuckle under eventually. Some even learn to like it. Not rodeo bulls. Their brains arent wired for submission. They not only refuse to be ridden; they find ever more inventive ways to cast people off. Watching old videos of J31, you can see him learn as he goes. At first, he just charges around the ring and jumps up and down. But the older he gets the crueller and less predictable he becomes. He spins one way, then the other, charges forward, and jerks to the side. His front and back ends start to uncouple, jackhammering the ground independently. His spine twists and rolls, leaving the rider with no balancing point, no center of gravity. By the age of five, he weighs nearly two thousand pounds and is built like a clenched fist: all hoof and horn and fast-twitch muscle. Sumner eventually sold him to another rancher, Sammy Andrews, figuring that he was too much bull for the local rodeo circuit. It was Andrews who gave him a name to match his reputation: Bodacious. He was like a monster once he matured, Tuff Hedeman, a four-time world champion, told me. Even the good guys were super scared of him. Youd see world champions ride him for a jump or two and then get off. In 1993, at a rodeo in Long Beach, California, Hedeman drew Bodacious for what some consider the greatest ride in historya near-perfect exhibition of balance and anticipation. Two years later, the bull got his revenge. At the world championships in Las Vegas that August, Hedeman was leading the standings by what proved to be an insurmountable three hundred points when he drew Bodacious again. This time, a split second after leaving the chute, the bull bucked forward with all his might. Hedeman did what riders are supposed to do: he leaned high over the bulls shoulders and flung his arm back as a counterbalance. But just as he came forward, Bodacious threw his head backsmashing it square into Hedemans face. Hedeman stayed on somehow, his hand twisted in the rope, only to get head-butted again, thrown into the air, and bounced off the bulls back like a rag doll. The ride broke every bone in Hedemans face below the eyes. It took thirteen and a half hours of reconstructive surgery and five titanium plates to repair the damage, and Hedemans sense of smell and taste never returned. I told my buddy afterward, I must have broke my jaw, because when I bite down my teeth dont come together, he recalled. People were looking at me and then turning their eyes away or putting their hands over their faces. I thought, I must look like Frankenstein or something. Seven weeks later, when a rider named Scott Breding drew Bodacious at the National Finals Rodeo, he elected to wear a hockey mask for protection. It didnt help. In less than four seconds, the bull had knocked Breding off with the same move, fracturing his left eye socket. The next day, Sammy Andrews retired Bodacious from competition. I didnt want to be the guy who let him kill someone, he told me. The boys at the Camp of Champions couldnt wait to get on a bull like that. How else would they be world champions one day? Bull riding is a collaborative sporta pairs competition in which one partner tries to kill the other, like an ice dance with an axe murderer. If a rider manages to hang on for eight seconds, hell earn up to fifty points for his own form and fifty for the bulls. The meaner the animal the better the score. Ooh, I really want to ride 44! Wacey Schalla told his friends Trigger Hargrove and Jet Erickson one morning. He jumped up and down on the catwalk along the arena, and pointed at a bony brown calf in the chute below. I hear that suckers rank! Wacey, Trigger, and Jet were eight years old. The tops of their heads barely cleared my waist, yet they already had the rangy look of seasoned riders. They wore saddleman jeans and paisley Western shirts, tooled leather boots and straw cowboy hats, oversized to fend off the broiling June sun. Wacey was the smallest of the three and the most intensely focussed. His eyes would turn to slits above his freckled cheeks as he visualized his next ride. Trigger was taller and leaner, with a natural swaggerhe was an excellent roper as well as rider. Jet was the shyest and the most delicately built. While Trigger kept up a running monologueThat 36 nearly yanked my arm off! But then the next one didnt hardly buck at allJet slumped against the rails, adrift in his own thoughts. Hes kind of a floater, his father, Everett, told me. But when he scoots up on that calf and it takes off, his body takes over and he just rides. He laughed. It kind of reminds you of the legends of the past, watching them kids. In the past two decades, selective breeding has made rodeo bulls more dangerous and valuable than ever before.The best ones cost half a million dollars and their semen can fetch thousands. Almost every weekend, the three boys would ride against one another at some small-town rodeo in Oklahoma. The previous Saturday, it had been Elk City, with Wacey coming in first, Trigger second, and Jet third. But the order could easily have been shuffled. Its just back and forth with those three, Triggers grandfather, Eddie, told me. Theyre the fiercest competitors and the best of friends. All three were the sons of professional rodeo riders. Theyd gone from bouncing around on sheep at the age of three or fourmutton busting, it was calledto riding calves at six and now the occasional steer. In two or three years, theyd get on their first bulls. Their winnings came mostly in the form of engraved belt buckles and prize saddlesIve got a bunch more in my closet somewhere, Wacey told me, when he showed me a few buckles at his houseas well as small cash purses. But theyd grow more substantial soon enough. Caden Bunch, one of the eleven-year-olds at the camp, had made more than a hundred thousand dollars. The Camp of Champions was a final tuneup for the biggest rodeo of their lives: the Youth Bull Riders World Finals. The event would draw the top fifty riders from six age groups to Abilene, Texas, in July. It would feature rougher stock than most of them were used to riding, so they wanted all the help they could get. The camp, founded by a bull rider turned cowboy preacher named Andy Taylor, was a combination rodeo school and revival meeting. The first half of the week had been devoted to girls eventsbarrel racing, goat tying, and breakaway ropingand the second half to boys events: calf roping, bull riding, and bronco busting. The camp was held on the grounds of the Trinity Fellowship, a budding megachurch in Sayre, Oklahoma, on the short-grass prairie just east of the Texas Panhandle. There were livestock pens and dusty red arenas to one side and a striped tent to the other, where the campers met for church services every morning and evening. You know whats cool, boys? Ted Nuce, one of the trainers and a former world-champion bull rider, told them. Riding bulls is a Jesus trap. You guys are going to pray because you want to. You need some protection out there. Earlier that day, the boys had been to the first of the morning services. These had a comforting sameness to them. The house band, led by a local bulldozer operator and his sons, would play some Southern-flavored Christian rock. Andy Taylor would drawl a few lines of Scripture, then some retired bull riders would come up to testify. These were small, wiry, tightly wound menthe bantam roosters of the rodeo world, one calf roper called themaccustomed to keeping their pain to themselves. Theyd talk, haltingly, about the injuries that had laid them low at the height of their careers, and how little they knew about earning a living in the real world. How theyd succumbed to drink and drugs, disloyalty and meanness before the Lord pulled them through. Some of my family members just abandoned me, a young, bespectacled bull rider named Matt Austin confessed. I was broken. But Im here to tell you that God will never leave you. I couldnt tell how deeply this registered with the eight-year-olds. Riding calves is less life-threatening than riding bulls, and Wacey and his friends seemed to think they were immortal anyhow. They were by turns the best-behaved boys Id ever metthey addressed adults as sir and Maam, took off their hats in church, and lowered their eyes and mumbled Excuse me when they bumped into youand the rowdiest, the least domesticated. They make me proud, their counsellor, Keith Hutton, told me on my first night at camp. He was about to say more when a chorus of screams and shouts erupted from the bunkhouse below, in the church basement. Hes bleeding! a high voice was squealing. Theres blood everywhere! Hutton sighed and blew out his cheeks. He waited a moment for the noise to subside, then lurched up from the couch and trudged downstairs. Reports on the incident would remain muddled and contradictory. As far as Hutton could tell, Wacey was jumped by another boy after beating him in a game of H-O-R-S-E. Trigger waded in to defend him, and in the ensuing fracas the assailant fell and smacked his head, opening up a gash. It was kind of a freaky deal, Hutton told me the next morning. It looked like his head had fallen off, there was so much blood. By then, in any case, the boys were all friends again, monkeying around in the breakfast line while Trigger practiced his roping tricks. A little blood, they knew, came with the territory. Triggers uncle had torn off a thumb roping steers, and Jets father had snapped the C1 vertebra in his neck when a bull named Stoney tossed him on his head. He spent the next six months immobilized in a halo, not sure if he could ever get on a bull again. We know its dangerous, he told me. But theres more glory in it than injuries, Ill promise you that. And the pain always goes away. Sometimes you just have to wait longer than others. When breakfast was over, Hutton corralled the boys into a little trailer hitched to a golf cart and hauled them over to the arena. (He was legally blind, so he couldnt drive a van.) The Calf-Rider Express is pullin out! he shouted, then turned and fixed them with a baleful glare. Hey! I dont need to hear a bunch of yellin! We had enough of that foolishness last night. And dont go jumpin off the trailer! That freaks me out. Bald and gap-toothed, with bright, bewildered eyes, Hutton grew up an Army brat in England. He got deported for selling black-market cigarettes, and spent the next few decades smoking weed and paying rent, as he put it, until he found Jesus. This hot blonde was on me to come to church, he said. I thought she might give me a little, but I ended up crying out thirty years of being pissed. Ive been clean ever since. When he wasnt volunteering at the church, Hutton worked as a roofer, a substitute teacher, and a drug counsellor. It sometimes seemed like hed treated someone in almost every family in his town. Western Oklahoma is a tough place to live in the best of times. The soil is poor and full of gypsum and clay. The winds can rise to catastrophe out of a clear blue sky. In the right light, theres a kind of grandeur to its vast, featureless sweep, where every truck stop and water tower can take on totemic power. But any sense of self-importance has long since been wrung from the local population. People age quickly here. The young men with hips cocked and thumbs hooked through belt loops turn into swaybacked old ranchers soon enough, beer guts tucked into embroidered shirts. The girls in ponytails and rhinestones weather into creased, careworn women. They know that the eyes of the world are focussed elsewhereon Texas, perhapsand do their best to get on with it. Early that morning, a towering thunderhead had rumbled in from the east, stripping branches from the cottonwoods and flooding the streets of Oklahoma City. But the sky blew clear within minutes, leaving only muddy ruts behind. Theyre saying that this is going to be the next Mojave Desert if we dont have a weather change, Hutton said. Its been going on for ten or twelve years now. The fracking industry had brought new jobs to the areaElk City was growing fastbut without water the boom might not last long. And what with the low minimum wage and the high teen-pregnancy rate, methamphetamines and prescription-drug addiction, life was lived ever closer to the bone. Around here, the notion of childhood as a safe, protected placea benign bubbleseemed like poor training for life. Religion and rodeo made more sense. Rodeo camp features calf roping and bronco busting for boys; for girls, theres barrel racing, goat tying, and breakaway roping. When the eight-year-olds had arrived at the arena and put on their helmets and protective vests, one of the trainers gathered them around him in a circle. We dont do this for the money, he told them. We do this because the very first time we got on a bullthe first time we got bucked off and hit the ground and got upright there we knew that this is what we were meant to be doing. He cast his eyes around the circle, peering hard at each one of them. God has a plan for you being here, he said. What you learn in bull riding youre going to be able to apply to everyday life. When life gives you a storm, you can sit back and let it toss you wherever it wants to toss you, or you can have the confidence to know that God created you to be a winner, and to have honor and glory. The boys didnt need convincing. A bucking calf seemed like the ultimate amusement-park ride to thema bumper car and extreme coaster rolled into one. When they werent in line for another ride, they were practicing their moves on the Mighty Bucky: a padded barrel perched on a steel pivot and springs. I never saw a serious injury among the eight-year-olds, but plenty of boys were bawling by the time they picked themselves up off the ground. Yet they couldnt wait for the next round. The teen-agers, if anything, were even more eager. Nearly every ride left one of them hobbling to the gate, clutching an arm or leg. I saw one boys cheek split open by a bulls horn and another boy dragged across the ground like tin cans behind a bumper, then stomped on for good measure. Both were back on another bull the same day. I thought about a playground near my house in Brooklyn, in Park Slope. A couple of years ago, it was beautifully renovated by the city, with a rock-lined stream meandering through it and an old-fashioned pump that children could crank to set the water flowing. The stream was the delight of the neighborhood for a while, thronged with kids splashing through the shallows and floating sticks down the current. Yet some parents were appalled. The rocks were a menace, they declared. The edges were too sharp, the surfaces too slippery. A child could fall and crack her skull. I actually kept tapping them to check if they were really rocks, one commenter wrote on the Park Slope Parents Web site. It seemed odd to me to have big rocks in a playground. Within two weeks, a stonemason had been brought in to grind the edges down. The protests continued. One mother called a personal-injury lawyer about forcing the city to remove the rocks. Another suggested that something be done to soften them. I am actually dreading the summer because of those rocks, still another complained. The parents at the camp flipped this attitude on its head. They valued courage over caution, grit over sensitivity. They revelled in the raw physicality of boys. The mothers sat in the bleachers taking videos and hollering adviceWyatt, just ride the way Daddy taught you! The fathers straddled the chute, leaning over their sons to cinch the rope and shove the calf into position: Are you ready? Yes, sir! Youve got to take the fight to him. Yes, sir! Youve got to want it. When the gate blew open, they leaped up on the rail and watched their sons with clenched fists and narrowed eyes. They werent stage parents, for the most part. They just took following your bliss to its logical extreme. Id let my kid do whatever he has a passion for, one mother told me, even if he wanted to be a piano player. How dangerous is bull riding? The best numbers come from a sports epidemiologist named Dale Butterwick. In 2006, when he was at the University of Calgary, Butterwick set up a registry of rodeo injuries and spent three years filling it with data from rodeo medics and riders self-reports. Between 1989 and 2009, he found, twenty-one contestants had died in the United States and Canada. Sixteen were bull riders, including one twelve-year-old boy. Another twenty-eight sustained life-changing injuries. Butterwicks study didnt track the riders less grievous accidentsthe breaks, tears, gashes, dislocations, concussions, and contusions that can occur on almost any ride. But, according to a twenty-five-year study that used data from the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, injuries tend to cluster in four areas: the head and face (sixteen per cent), the neck and back (fifteen per cent), the knees (twelve per cent), and the shoulders (twelve per cent). Its not if youre gonna get hurt; its when, some of the parents at the camp acknowledged. Others downplayed the risk, saying theyd rather have one bull try to kill them than eleven football players. Yet bull riders are ten times more likely than football players to be seriously injured. Theirs is the most dangerous organized sport in the world. Butterwicks data ended with an alarming spike: in the last two years of the study, the rate of catastrophic injury was more than double that of the twenty-year average. This came as no surprise to Cody Custer, the senior trainer at the camp. The quality of the stock just keeps getting better, he told me. When we were riding, you might go to ten rodeos and maybe get one bull that bucked really hard. Now, out of a herd of thirty, twenty-two will be buckers. Its an epidemic, really. Custers son Brett was a sixteen-year-old bull rider at the camp. He was a little stud, Custer said. But all it takes is one time to break an egg in thereor kill a kid or paralyze him. The Camp of Champions played it safe by rodeo standards. The boys had to wear helmets and vests, the trainers stressed caution, the livestock were somewhat less than homicidal. But at the Youth World Finals all bets would be off: the previous year, among the oldest contestants, three out of four had been bucked off. When Custer was born, in 1965, rodeo still seemed an extension of ordinary cowboying. He joined his first roundup at the age of four, on his familys ranch south of the Grand Canyon, and spent much of his youth riding bareback. He learned to loosen his hips and shift his weight, to roll with every pitch and yaw. He learned to ride with his feet, clamping them tight to an animals sides and reacting to the slightest twitch. He learned to use every inch and ounce of his lariat-thin frame, sitting tall to increase his leverage and send pressure down his legs. By the age of fourteen, hed ridden some twenty-five hundred steer. These were castrated animals, not nearly as strong and wild as an uncut bull, which was just what he needed. Most of them just went straight up and down, he told me. But my confidence got sky high and so did my skills. In his twenty years on the circuit, Custer had his share of injuries: a collapsed lung, several broken ribs, and a broken jaw that had to be wired shut for five weeks. He had major surgeries on both shoulders and one of his knees and suffered a string of severe concussions, the worst of which knocked him out for more than half an hour. Yet he counts himself lucky. Custer won a world championship in 1992, was elected to the Professional Bull Riders Ring of Honor in 2003, and was still walking when he retired, that same year. I got away pretty good, all things considered, he told me. You probably wont be hearing about twenty-year bull-riding careers anymore. Bodacious changed the way rodeo animals are bred. Before him, most bulls were a dubious commodityworth more for beef than for bucking cowboys. A rancher might get a hundred dollars every time his bull was ridden, twice that much at big events. The riders made the real moneythey were the ones that people came to see. Bodacious changed that equation. People whod never heard of Tuff Hedeman knew the name of the bull whod rearranged his face, as Hedemans wife later put it. After Bodacious was retired, he toured the country like a war hero, appearing in GQ and Penthouse, making personal appearances at restaurants, casinos, and car dealerships. It was unreal, Sammy Andrews told me. I thought wed sell two or three T-shirts. But we had tour buses coming around to see him. There were Bodacious coffee mugs, belt buckles, jewelry lines, and condoms. If a Brahman bull ever were a superstar, then Bodacious just might be, the band Primus sang. Hes a cream-colored, beefy-brawn, full-fledged, four-footed bovine celebrity. Wacey Schalla (left) and Jet Erickson practice on an oil-barrel bull. With fewer and fewer ordinary animals to practice on, the learning curve gets steeper every year. It wasnt long before breeders found that they didnt really need riders to make money. As Bodaciouss brand of notoriety spread to other bullsWolfman, Dillinger, Asteroid, Bushwackerranchers began to earn more from selling sperm, swag, and licensing agreements than they did from rodeos. At events called futurities, the bulls could now compete directly against one another, carrying dummy cowboys on their backs while judges rated their bucking ability. The top bull could earn a quarter of a million dollars at a single event, and as the purses grew so did the sports attention to genetics. Ranchers once content to breed any bull that leaped around now turned to outcrossing and in-vitro fertilization to select specific behaviors: the dropkick, the side spin, the twisting belly roll. The result was a succession of ever more powerful, more athletic, more murderous bulls. The only question was who could ride them. When Custer won his world championship, in 1992, he rode more than three-quarters of the bulls he drew. Last years world champion rode just half. The change has been especially hard on young riders. Their learning curve gets steeper every year, and there are fewer and fewer ordinary animals for them to practice on. These kids that are eleven, twelve, thirteen years oldtheyre getting on bulls that we never saw until we were pros, Custer told me. Its like a phenomenal little football player being put in with a bunch of college kids who want to knock his head off. Custer is a hard man to rile up. The dashing young cowboy from the old videos now wears tinted glasses and button-down shirts and ends every conversation with God bless. But when he talks about rodeo politics you can see the old bull rider in him. Four years ago, when his son was still in junior high, Custer sent a letter to the National High School Rodeo Association asking for steers to be used rather than bulls for the smaller contestants. A number of retired rodeo stars co-signed the proposal, but the request was ignored. The guys who are raising the bulls, most of them have dollar signs in their eyes, Custer told me. Their interest is not in that little boy. Their interest is in the bull. A couple of weeks before the Youth World Finals, I went to visit Dillon Page, the co-owner of D&H Cattle Company, in south-central Oklahoma. Pages family has been raising livestock in the bottomland along the Washita River for three generations. When he bought his first set of bucking bulls, thirty years ago, there were a few dozen rodeo stock contractors in the country. Now there are close to a thousand. For the past few years, Page has managed the ranch with his son Hoyt Dillon, at one point winning the Professional Bull Riders Stock Contractor of the Year award for six years running. H.D., as his son is known, runs the breeding operation and shuttles the bulls to rodeos, while Dillon directs the day-to-day workings of the ranch. On the morning I visited, hed been up since seven, haying the fields. Weve got some bulls acting like queers back there, he told me as we walked toward his truck to begin the morning feeding. Seems to happen every time you get a weather change. A couple of bulls start ridin each other, then they go to fightin, and it just turns into a blasted mess. Thats how you end up with a lot of your cripples. Page, who is sixty-three, has the crouched, sinewy build and the flinty manner of an old deputy sheriff in a Western. He holds the small of his back as he walks and rubs his neck, which is deeply creased and baked red by the sun. As he muttered instructions to the cowboys on his property, a gold tooth flashed from time to time in his upper jaw. Some five hundred bulls were scattered across the ranchs fifteen hundred acres. Tawny, black, mottled, whiterodeo bulls are almost always muttsthey grazed under spreading pecans, in thirteen pastures separated by tall steel fences. The best of them could go for half a million dollars in their prime, but the ranch made even more by selling half-interests in calves. An investor might pay twenty-five thousand for a yearling, cover all its expenses and entry fees, then split the winnings with Page and his son. If all went well, the bull would get sent to thirty-five or forty rodeos a year, earning five to ten thousand in fees and up to a hundred thousand in futurities and other winnings. After eight or nine years, hed be retired, then used to sire calves for another decade or more. A single straw of champion semen could go for upward of five thousand dollars. When we reached the first pasture, Page jumped out of the truck to open the gate and drove over to a row of galvanized troughs. He put the truck in neutral to set it rolling slowly beside them and flipped a toggle beneath the steering wheel. This triggered an auger in back to release the feeda mixture of cracked corn, cottonseed, soybean hulls, and dried distillers grain. As it poured down the length of the troughs, Page jumped out of the cab again and ran back to pull some hay from the truck bed. He scattered it around the troughs, ran back to the cab, climbed in, and drove to the next gate, then started the process all over. At one point, a big white bull came shouldering toward him, testicles hanging nearly to the ground. Page shouted and waved his arms. When that didnt work, he bent down and picked up a dirt clod and pelted him with it. The bull stood his ground and gave a deep grunt, then shook his horns and clattered off. You just hope they dont decide to run over you, Page said when he got back in. Before he bred bulls, Page tried his hand at riding them for a few years. He was never good enough to make a career of it, he told me, but he got off easy where injuries were concernedjust a few broken bones and a ruptured spleen. Although there was that one ride, when he was seventeen or eighteenthe one that left him with three ribs broken off into his lower belly. I was pissin and shittin blood for four days, he said. I dont know if it was my bladder or my kidneys, but something wasnt right in there. The pain got so bad that he had a friend haul him to the emergency room in Ardmore. But the doctors kept him waiting for four or five hours, so he went back home. Two weeks later, the bleeding finally stopped. I guess it wasnt life-threatening, he said. I asked him how he would have fared on bulls like the ones he breeds now, and he laughed. Oh, not very well, I guess. I rode some pretty good ones in my dayone of em, Js Pet, hadnt been rode in five years. I thought Id done a pretty good deal. But he couldnt even hold a light to some of these things that we buck today. Bucking bulls are like human athletes: every generation has a few that are unaccountably great. The Peyton Mannings and LeBron Jameses cant really be reproduced or used to gauge the average level of play. Its when you look down the bench that you start to see a pattern. Take Stone Sober over there, Page said. He pointed to a red bull pacing inside a trailer next to the pasture, soon to be taken to a rodeo. He was built like a middleweight wrestler, with bunched shoulders and thick veins ridging his muscles. Wed rather have him a little bigger, he said. Hes probably thirteen hundred, fourteen hundred poundshis mama was little bitty. But he can jump as high as this fence with somebody on it. He can turn back and spin and go the other way, and he has a lot of kick and a great big belly roll. Shucks, there aint no telling what hes gonna do. I dont think he knows hisself. In the past three years, Stone Sober had bucked off twenty-two out of twenty-three riders, most of them in under four seconds. Jadeyn Lara (left) and Shayne Spain after completing the third round of mutton busting. Spain finished third over all; Lara finished eighth. They have become friends through competing together. An animal like that is a freak of nature, Page said. Its a petri dish full of exotic mutationsof tics and phobias, spastic nerves and explosive rages, carefully culled and combined. The sperm from a champion sire is usually collected off-site, mixed with eggs from a proven dam, and transplanted into a ranchers cows. It doesnt always work. Genetic recombination is a crapshoot, and the outcome depends as much on psychology as on physiology. Confidence plays a big part in it, H. D. Page told me later, on the phone. If a bull gets rode every time he pokes his head out the gate, hell either quit buckin or change his buckin pattern to win. Some of them just figure its not worth the effort, and some of them learn to enjoy their jobs. They get addicted to the adrenaline. The result can be as unhealthy for the bull as for the rider. When a two-thousand-pound animal leaps six feet in the air and hammers down on his back legs, things can go wrong: joints pop, tendons snap, backs get thrown out of kilter. One of the pastures on the Pages ranch was full of hobbled old gladiators, kept around for semen or sentiment. This one here broke his leg at the finals, Page said, pulling up next to a white-headed bull with a black eye patch. Hard Twisted. Won a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars as a two-year-old, but you cant set a broke leg. See how crooked it is? He let the truck idle a little farther, then pointed to a big brown bull stepping gingerly beside the fence. His leg? He broke it so bad that it drawed up. It dont even touch the ground. He shook his head. I shoulda done killed him. They make the best hamburger meat there iswell muscled and lean. Aint nobody thatll have better hamburger meat. But sometimes you get to thinkin too much and you keep em around when you shouldnt. I asked Page if he ever wonders if things have gone too far. His son tried to ride Bodacious three times, yet here they are trying to make bulls even meaner. Is there a limit to how dangerous a bull can or should be? I hope not, he said. Because I intend on making one thats a whole lot ranker than weve had before. He smirked. You know the bad thing? We cant breed cowboys. If you could figure out how to get a set of women and three or four sires that had all that heart and the other ingredients that it takes, then you could match the sires and the dams up like we do the bulls. Then maybe wed have a great bull rider. In the meantime, theres only one alternative: start them young. The Taylor County Expo Center, in Abilene, must have looked like the Taj Mahal to Wacey and his friends. Theyd been to a lot of rodeos by thendusty little arenas at the edge of town, with a rickety concession stand on one side and some bleachers on the otherbut never one like this. The parking lot was as big as an airport, with what looked like a giant spaceship in the middle. It had a hallway inside that went clear around it, filled with folks selling cowboy hats and rifle cases, saddle soap, tooth guards, rope rosin, and T-shirts that said things like Mama Tried and The Hurrier I Go, the Behinder I Get. When you walked down the tunnel and out into the arena, the seats went up and up on every side. The roof looked like it was five stories high. The floor was covered in a maze of pens and chutes full of livestock, with cowboys hanging off all the rails. There was even air-conditioningat a rodeo! Imagine that. The World Finals are really six separate competitions, each for a different age group and animal. The four-to-six-year-olds ride sheep, the seven- and eight-year-olds are on calves, the nine-to-eleven-year-olds on steers, and the rest on increasingly fearsome bulls. Each contestant rides once a day for three days, earning up to a hundred points per ride from the four judges stationed around the arena. On the fourth day, the top fifteen scorers out of the fifty in each group compete for their division championship. There are cash prizes for the highest scores every day and a big pot at the end for each championmore than sixty thousand dollars altogether. A lot of this event is about the luck of the draw, Curtis Spain, one of the events organizers, told me. The best buckers earn the best scores for their riders, but theyre also the most likely to toss a rider off. We call that thinning the herd. Back home in Forney, Texas, Spain had his own rodeo arena as well as a mechanical bull. His son Mason was one of the top eleven-year-olds in the finals, and his daughter Shayne, age seven, was an excellent mutton busterone of only two girls in the finals. Girls could qualify for the older age groups as well, but most dropped out before thatoften at their parents urging. The worlds most dangerous sport is not something you really want to let your little girl do, her father told me. This is Shaynes farewell tour. The first round was rough on Spains kids, as it was on the boys from Oklahoma. All of them rode well but drew sluggish animals, earning mediocre scores. Trigger was the exception. He drew one of the feistiest calves in the pena big black Holsteinbut got bucked off right before the buzzer. He came out and took two big blows and then started lopin, Trigger told me the next morning. The second blow put me over on the side, and its really hard to stay on when hes lopin and bouncin like that. I told him that I was sure hed do better this time, but he didnt look convinced. Hopefully, he said, picking at his chaps. The Star-Spangled Banner was blaring over the loudspeakers by thena taped version by LeAnn Rimes, sounding like a country girl whod just walked out on her worthless lover. Over by the chutes, the mutton busters were getting ready to start the second round. Shayne Spain leaned against a rail and glanced up at Jadeyn Lara, the only other girl in the finals. Shayne was a year older and half a head taller, with a gap in her front teeth. Her stringy blond hair fell loose across her shirther brothers, which shed worn for good luck. Jadeyn had on a pink vest that said Ridin Dirty and pink chaps stitched with dollar signsher nickname was J. Money. Shed positioned herself at the highest point in the arena, on a platform above the center chute, and was kneeling there with her head lifted high, like the figurehead on a ships prow. She and Shayne had both dominated their local rodeo circuitsShayne in north-central Texas and Jadeyn in the southeastand both wanted badly to be the first girl to win the finals. The boys hate it, Curtis Spain told me. They hate losing to a girl. But little girls develop faster than little boys, and Shayne is fearless, man. She likes rubbing their noses in it. Sheep arent all that into bucking. Truth be told, they dont like to run that much, either. It takes a sharp spur and a clanging cowbell to get most of them moving, and even then theyre a pretty smooth, well-cushioned ride. Still, the mutton busters found ways to fall off. Some lost their grip on the wool and keeled over sideways. Others held on tight and pulled their mounts down on top of them. One or two hit the arena wall and got peeled off, or flipped head over heels when their sheep came to a dead stop. Shayne and Jadeyn both managed to hang on, but Shayne got the better draw. Her sheep had been sheared recently, so it was harder to hold but also faster and jumpier. She scored a sixty-four, for fifth place over all. Jadeyn started off well, or at least upright, then slowly began to tip over. By the time the buzzer sounded, she was hanging off her sheep at three oclock, yet she never fell: fifty-four pointsenough for eighteenth place. A junior bull rider loaded in the bucking chute in the final moments before a ride. Contestants at the Youth Bull Riders World Finals range in age from four to nineteen. By the time the calf riders turn came, the crowd was getting giddy. Sweet Child O Mine was playing on the P.A., with a ragged chorus of bleats and bellows behind it. As the contestants lined up, the m.c. introduced each one with a verbal drumroll: age, home town, championships, and sponsors. Tiger Mart, B&B Towing, Pops Honey Fried Chicken. A lot of the boys already had stage names: Dusty Rhodes, Colt Christie, Fate Snyder, Tater Tot Wilcox. Their parents knew that rodeo is one part extreme sport, one part show business. Some of the riders looked as gaudy as rodeo clowns in their embroidered shirts and lizard-skin boots, crested Roman helmets, and vests that read Cowkids for Christ. But it was up to the calves to make them look good. Wacey drew a big white Holstein with mean-looking eye patches. The calf looked promising at first, but proved to be a halfhearted bucker. It was all Wacey could do to score sixty points, leaving him in thirteenth placejust enough to make the championship round, if he rode well the next day. Jet drew one of the rankest calves in Abilene: a twisting, half-spinning specimen whod bucked off his rider the day before. For a second or two, Jet looked loose and in control. Then he leaned a touch too far forward, the calf changed directions and kicked up its back legs, and just like that the boy was tumbling through the air. A few minutes later, Trigger met the same fate. He came out looking stiff and off center, got thrown to one side, and bounced off just before the buzzer. Both boys got up crying but dried their tears by the time they reached the gate. They would not qualify for the final round. He hit the ground trying, Jets father told me afterward. That calf would dang sure have been hard for any kid to ride. Triggers dad was less philosophical. Hes in a slump, he said. First time Ive seen it in his life. Its just really frustratinghes got so much natural talent. When hes locked in, he cant be beat, but hes been riding like an average kid. Those first two calves, he could ride those with his eyes closed. The next morning, before the national anthem, one of the event directors made his way to the microphone. A tall, barrel-chested Texan named Danny Malone, he worked as a lineman northwest of Fort Worth and had a sixteen-year-old boy in the Open Bull competition. It had been brought to his attention, he announced, that some parents had been acting inappropriatelyusing foul language and whuppin on boys whod been bucked off. Well, Im here to tell you that that will not be tolerated, he said. Its the reason we have U.S. Marshals and Texas Rangers here. If you are caught, you will be asked to leave this property and you will not be allowed back. He paused, then added, almost beseechingly, Guys, come on! Theyre young and theyre trying their best. If theyre nothey, we dont know whats going on in their heads. Maybe theyre just having an off day. Now, I know Im not their parent. I cant tell you what to do with your kids in private. But if I see you whuppin on them I will not tolerate it. And, yes, I know who you are. Most parents at the World Finals werent used to seeing their kids bucked off, much less three out of four times. At one point, I watched one of the fourteen-year-olds leave the arena after getting thrown off his second bull. He sat down, took off his helmet, and smashed it into his forehead. Then he did it again, methodically, five times in a row. Thats gotta hurt, someone next to me said. It was the first time Id heard that at a rodeo. When I asked Malone for a rundown of the weeks injuries, he mentioned the usual bumps and bruisesrodeo-speak for everything from deep lacerations to hobbling hematomas. Then he went on to list a dislocated hip, a fractured eye socket, and a stock contractor whose incisors had been knocked in by a swinging gate. We had to put his teeth in saline and send him to the trauma center, Malone said. Malones son Austen was one of the best riders in Abilene, as well as one of the most injury-prone. A lanky, sweet-faced kid with long curly blond hair, hed had several concussions, broken arms, and a dislocated neck. Hed shattered his right leg so badly that the tibia and the fibula were snapped off completely, the foot turned around backward. The previous year, Austen had spent a week in the hospital after a bull jumped on his chest. Yet hed come back to win the World Finals. I worry about it. I do, his father told me. We discuss it all the time. If something serious happens in the arena and God calls his numberif a fatality happens to my son bull ridingitll be a struggle. Im not going to lie to you. But Ill know that my son will be at peace. That he died happy and enjoying what he was doing. A few minutes later, the mutton busters came out to kick off the third round. Shayne was just seven points out of the lead, but her father didnt have much faith in the sheep shed drawn: its last rider had scored only fifty-four points. Shaynes only hope was to spur it out of its torpor, working its sides with both heels, though shed have a harder time keeping her balance. I told her to let fly the leg, Curtis said. Just let fly. Get all the points you can. The tactic worked. The sheep pelted across the arena with sudden vigor, the girl kept her seat, and the ride earned sixty-two points. You know what they say, the m.c. shouted. Sometimes the best cowboy for the job is a cowgirl! Shayne was now in third place for the championship round. Even better, shed outscored her rival, Jadeyn, who hadnt been as lucky in her draw and was stuck back in eighth. Were making our way up! Curtis told me. Were like a shark, circling, circling, looking for a chance. Wacey was in a tougher spot, twenty-one points out of first. He needed both a great ride and some help from the leaders to win. When I found him on the catwalk, waiting for his third ride, his brow was furrowed and his eyes fierce with concentration. Just thinking about the business of what Ive got to do, he said. At his parents ranch, in Eakly, Oklahoma, hed spent hours watching bull-riding videos to perfect his form. Hed been working on keeping his free hand high to help control his upper body, and his other hand pulled tight against the rope. When the calf kicked up, he needed to lean forward off its haunches, and when it broke to the side, he had to keep his butt down, centered and correct. Riding bulls is such a mind game, his father, Luke, told me. You can buck yourself off just as easily as anything. But hes a little young for that. The truth is hes on top of his game. Earlier that morning, the third-round draw had been posted on the wall of the tunnel to the arena. Luke peered at it for a second, then nodded with a tight grin. For once, Wacey had a bucker. Calf No. 99992 had tossed his rider on the first day and hadnt been ridden the second, so hed be fresh. Thats good, Luke said. He can score some points on that one after those sorry calves hes had. His wife, Nikki, wasnt so sure. Shed seen what happened to Jet and Trigger. I was kind of hoping for something a little more average, she said, her face pale and drawn behind her shades. Wacey, though, had no doubts: he wanted that calf. A former champion who is angry about the breeding of fiercer and fiercer bulls says, You probably wont be hearing about twenty-year bull-riding careers anymore. Riders know that injury is a matter of when, not if. When his turn finally came, he punched his helmet and climbed into the chute. He clamped his legs around the calfs bony, squirming back, rubbed some rosin into his rope, and wrapped it tight around his fist. Ride him like a champ, Wace! Jet yelled, from the catwalk above him. Trigger was there, too, grinning down at him. Then the gate flew open and the calf charged out, leaping and flexing across the arena like a steel spring shot from an old tractor. He twisted one way and the other, jackknifed in the air and rolled his belly, but could not get the rider off. Wacey matched him rhythm for rhythm, free arm waving and heels flying, spurring him on even harder. When the buzzer sounded and hed tumbled to his feet, he gave one of the bullfighters a high five and ran off. A little later, the m.c. announced the judges tally: 74.5the highest score for a calf rider all week. Wacey would go on to win the round and finish the rodeo in style, riding his last calf cleanly for a sixty-two. It wasnt quite enough to win the championship: his calf was game but underpowered, and he finished third. But his record from the previous round would stand. Shayne ended on an even better note, winning the last round. She finished third in her group as well. She and Wacey each earned a little more than a thousand dollars for their effortsenough to cover their families costs and perhaps a dinner at Applebees on the way home. By the time the judges had cut their checks and passed them out in the hall, the Expo Center was nearly empty, its booths packed up and the parking lot deserted. The other parents had headed home hours ago. Their boys had a long road ahead of them, and it would soon be past their bedtime. Watching the medics put away their ice packs and syringes, painkillers and rolls of bandages, I thought about the last time Tuff Hedeman drew Bodacious. It was December of 1995, just seven weeks after the bull had nearly killed him. Hedeman had lost twenty-five pounds and his body was still healing, but hed managed to qualify for the National Finals Rodeo anyway. Like Cody Custer and Lane Frostthe hero of the movie 8 Seconds, who was killed by a bull named Takin Care of Business in 1989Hedeman belonged to a generation of riders who prided themselves on never backing down. They just had something the guys dont have today, Dillon Page told me. They were raised up in the country and they got on bulls to win. Yet when Hedeman drew Bodacious again, in the sixth round of the finals, he knew what he had to do. I thought at first that I might have done something wrong the last time, he told me. But when I watched a video of the ride, the fact is that I was in perfect position for a bull of that calibre with that bucking pattern. There was nothing I could do. If Id tried to lean back to avoid his head, I would have been stretched out vertically, and when his back legs hit the ground the force of the downdraft would have jerked me off. Thats why most people really feared him. He was a great bull, but he got to the point where you could ride him correctly and still nearly get killed. And so, when Hedemans turn came to ride that night at the National Finals Rodeo, he climbed into the chute and onto Bodaciouss back. But when the gate swung open, Hedeman let the bull charge through without him. Then he tipped his hat to him and left the arena. Three rounds later, Scott Breding put on his hockey mask and gave Bodacious his final ride. Hedeman wouldnt trade his bull-riding experiences for anything. The closest hes come to that feeling has been flying in an F-16 fighter jet. Its just this explosion of adrenaline, he told me. Its indescribable. Still, when one of his sons started to get interested in the sport a few years ago, Hedeman took him into his trophy room and showed him some pictures of the guys he used to ride with. I told him, Just look at them. Those are the best guys that rode every year. Then I pointed at a few and said, I watched this guy die, this guy die, and this guy die. This guys in a wheelchair and this guys in a wheelchair. For me, ninety per cent of it was good. I never had a life-threatening injury. But the last thing I would ever want my son to do is ride bulls. Its insane. His son never did take up bull riding, but for other boys Hedemans story was just the sort of cautionary tale that hooked them on the sport for life. At the Camp of Champions, Id watched a succession of stiff-backed and patched-together men walk up to the microphone and, as the Oklahoma sun flamed and guttered on the horizon, do their best to warn the boys about what lay aheadwhat a brutal, debilitating world this could be. Yet the result was only to earn more converts. Blessed be the Lord, oh, my soul, as the cowboy preachers sang. For I am fearfully and wonderfully made. On the last afternoon, a cattle trough was hauled under the tent and twenty or thirty boys lined up to be baptized in it. Andy Taylor had asked the campers if any of them were ready to be born again, and Trigger, Jet, and Wacey all raised their hands. When the time came, though, only Trigger and Wacey went down easily. Jet, stripped to his swim trunks, climbed in willingly enough but then seemed to change his mind. He pushed his feet up against the end of the trough and gripped the rim tight with his hands. For just a moment, he hung there like a spider perched above a water glass. Then one of the church elders cradled his head and slowly, quiveringly, Jet let himself go under."
The New Yorker,L,The Real Threat to Obamacare,"

 


Credit Illustration by Christoph Niemann									 


Obamacare has had a rough month: its being challenged in a Supreme Court case; House Republicans are trying to undermine it with a lawsuit; and its poll numbers are terrible. But on the ground the Affordable Care Actwhich is starting its second open-enrollment periodlooks robust. Most people in the program say theyre happy with their plans, and new insurers are entering the market. Prices are pretty good, too: estimates suggest that premiums for the second-cheapest of the silver plans, which is the benchmark used to set subsidies, have risen by an average of just two to five per cent. Still, one fundamental challenge remains: if Obamacare is to succeed in holding down premiums over the long run, it needs consumers to shop around. People have no difficulty comparison-shopping and changing allegiance when it comes to, say, automobiles or consumer electronics. Companies in those markets face huge pressure to keep quality high and prices low. But there are also markets where consumers tend to stick with the same choice forever, even though switching could save them quite a bit of money. Energy bills are a classic example. Weve long been told we can save money by leaving incumbent providers for newer upstarts, but the vast majority of us havent. Economists call it consumer inertia, and you can see it in many fields, including banking, credit cards, and health insurance. History tells us that people are very sticky about health insurance, Larry Levitt, a senior vice-president at the Kaiser Foundation, told me. If you look at federal employees or at Medicare Part D, people generally dont switch plans from year to year. When people first sign up for health insurance, price matters a good dealmost Obamacare enrollees chose lower-cost, higher-deductible plans. But inertia quickly takes hold. When the Netherlands introduced managed competition for insurers, in 2006, almost twenty per cent of the insured switched after a year. But, by 2012, less than four per cent did. Karen Lamiraud, an economics professor at ESSEC Business School, studied the insurance market in Switzerland and found that the average switch rate between 1997 and 2007 was three per cent. Such inertia can be expensive. Ben Handel, an economist at Berkeley, did a study of the insurance choices made by eighty-five hundred employees at a big company, and found that most ended up staying with their default option, even when it cost them serious money. Consumers leave thousands of dollars a year on the table because of inertia, he told me. The key problem is what economists call switching costs. Sometimes they are tangible: if you want to get out of your cell-phone contract, youll have to pay a penalty. More insidious is what Handel calls hassle coststhe time and energy required to do enough research to make an informed switch. These are especially high when products and services are complicated and confusing, as with banking and health insurance, and when there are lots of potential options, which amplify peoples anxieties about making a bad choice. The complexity is daunting, and these things just arent intrinsically interesting to most people, Handel said. Obamacare has an extra layer of complexity, since you have to take subsidies and taxes into account. And since different insurers use different networks, getting a better deal often means finding a new doctora big disincentive. When switching costs are high, its much easier for companies to raise prices. If you have a storage unit, you may well have been lured by an attractive monthly rate, only to find that it soon started rising by significant increments. (What are you going to do? Move all your stuff?) Similarly, even though there are lots of affordable new Obamacare plans this year, many of last years are raising premiums substantially. Lamirauds study found that in Switzerland the gap between the most expensive health plans and the cheapest didnt narrow over time, which doesnt suggest much price sensitivity. There are some things about the A.C.A. that may limit inertias impact. The market for individual insurance has a lot of churn (people come in and out as they get and lose jobs, for instance), and, because new entrants pay attention to price, insurers have some incentive to keep prices reasonable. Many recipients, too, have relatively low incomes, which may make them likelier to scrutinize price. But the system also has a major feature that encourages inertia: your plan renews automatically each year if you do nothing. Thats crucial for getting people to stay insured, but it will keep a lot of people on plans that werent the best value they could have found. So how do you combat this? More information is a start. One study Handel conducted found that fully informed consumers saved a couple of thousand dollars compared with those who were less well informed. But merely making information available isnt enough: you have to confront people with it. In one experimental study, when Medicare Part D consumers got a letter telling them that they could save money by changing plans the chance of their actually doing so rose by almost fifty per cent. Decision-support companies, which analyze huge tranches of data in order to come up with personalized rankings of insurance plans, could work with the Obamacare exchanges. That probably wont make insurers very happy, but it should please taxpayers. Were going to pay most of the bill when Obamacare recipients make poor choices. So we should do all we can to help them make better ones."

""Wild"" is based on a New York Times best-selling memoir that chronicles Cheryl Strayeds (Resse Witherspoon) 1,100-mile hike up the Pacific Crest Trail. (Fox Searchlight)   1/2 Wild (R) In Wild, the stirring adaptation of Cheryl Strayeds 2012 memoir, Reese Witherspoon delivers an admirably restrained, un-glamorous performance as the author, who at age 26 hiked 1,110 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from California to Oregon in a ritual of physical endurance, philosophical reflection and spiritual cleansing.  Ann Hornaday  Remote Area Medical (Unrated) Remote Area Medical is an incredibly tragic movie. Its also an important one, reminding viewers that America is more than its coasts and cities. There are corners of the country we all too easily forget.  Stephanie Merry  Antarctica: A Year on Ice (PG) Antarctica: A Year on Ice is not your normal nature documentary. Shot in Antarctica over the course of 10 years, it includes, as one might hope, some breathtaking time-lapse photography of moving clouds, ice, shadows and lights. This last category includes not just the psychedelic atmospheric phenomenon known as the aurora australis, or the southern lights, but the normally dependable sun  which never dips below the horizon for several months of Antarctic summer and then disappears all winter.  Michael OSullivan  Miss Julie (R) Miss Julie is a master class in acting... for the stage. As a movie, however, writer-director Liv Ullmanns meticulous adaptation of August Strindbergs 1888 play about class and power feels overwrought and histrionic.

The Washington Post,L,Eric Garner case offers Obama a moment to seize - The Washington Post,"   By Dana Milbank Opinion writer December 5 at 12:22 PM  Follow @Milbank     The words, spoken about the Eric Garner travesty in New York, were righteous and powerful. When you look at what they did to this guy and putting him in a chokehold like that, its inexcusable  absolutely inexcusable and brutal.  Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nations capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. View Archive   Facebook Google+ RSS   How this cop did not go to jail, was not held responsible, is beyond me.  This is ridiculous. ... Its obscene. Its grotesque. Heres a guy who was not resisting arrest, was not being a jerk. This is the New York police completely out of control ... [M]anslaughter absolutely should have been considered. Why that wasnt considered is beyond me. And who uttered such phrases? The Rev. Al Sharpton? Lawyers for the Garner family?  Actually, these sentiments were voiced Thursday by Glenn Beck, one of the fiercest warriors of the right.  Conservatives, with a few exceptions, have responded with admirable outrage over a grand jurys failure to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was caught on video killing Garner, an unarmed African American. Pantaleo put Garner in a chokehold and ignored Garners cries that he couldnt breathe  even though the victims only alleged offense had been selling untaxed cigarettes.  Fox Newss Bill OReilly said he was extremely troubled by the video and Garner did not deserve what happened to him. His Fox colleague Andrew Napolitano said the grand jury made a grievous error because it seemed police used grossly excessive force on a nonviolent, non-threatening person, while Charles Krauthammer called the decision totally incomprehensible.  Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), head of the House Republican Conference, called for the House to hold hearings on the case. We need to be taking action, she told MSNBCs Morning Joe. House Speaker John Boehner later referred to McMorris Rodgerss remarks in a news conference, agreeing that the American people deserve more answers about what really happened here.  If it is possible to say that anything good has come from such an obvious miscarriage of justice, it is that the Garner decision has rekindled, if briefly, what Franklin Roosevelt called the warm courage of national unity.      While speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, President Obama discussed the recent grand jury decision not to indict a New York officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. (AP)   The Ferguson, Mo., decision last month, in which a grand jury declined to charge another white police officer who killed another unarmed black man, split the nation along racial and political lines, but this is one of the rare moments since the 9/11 attacks that has united left and right, black and white. It surely wont last long. The question is whether a reluctant president will seize the moment.  The early signs indicate more of the same reticence. Though President Obama has spoken twice about the Garner case since the decision, White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Thursday, asked about a broader national effort by the president, suggested people wait to see what Obamas new task force on policing comes up with  in 90 days.  But Obama doesnt have 90 days. If he waits, he will violate Rahm Emanuels famous rule, expressed after Obama won the presidency in 2008: You never want a serious crisis to go to waste, because it is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before. The Birmingham church bombing in 1963 helped to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Garner case should produce more than mumbles about a task force and some modest funds for police training and body cameras  items Obama proposed after the Ferguson grand jury decision.  There are any number of bigger things Obama could do, including alternatives to grand juries. This year, Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker  no liberal  signed first-in-the-nation legislation requiring an outside investigation whenever anybody dies in police custody and a public report if charges are not filed. The president could use his pulpit to push for similar laws in the other states. He could at least demand a national count of police killings, which, scandalously, we still dont have. Or he could take a broader approach to racial matters and revive a rewrite of elements of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court; there is already bipartisan support for such action.  In a sense, it matters less what Obama does than that he does something with this moment  particularly because the rest of his agenda, and with it much of his legacy, is moribund on Capitol Hill. A top White House official suggested to me Thursday that Obama may be coming around. We agree there is a moment here to have this conversation and make something of this, the official told me.  It would be more than a shame for Obama to squander this moment of national unity. He may never get another one.

The Washington Post,L,Key elements of Rolling Stones U-Va. gang rape allegations in doubt - The Washington Post," By Eugene Volokh December 5 at 7:50 PM  Follow @volokhc      Protestors carry signs and chant slogans in front of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia, Saturday night, Nov. 22, 2014, in Charlottesville, Va. The protest, the most well-attended of several throughout the day, was in response to the universitys reaction to an alleged sexual assault of a student revealed in a recent Rolling Stone article. (AP Photo/The Daily Progress, Ryan M. Kelly)  I havent been following the controversy about this story closely, but this Post article by T. Rees Shapiro struck me as very much worth reading. Here, by the way, is todays Rolling Stone note to readers about the story: To Our Readers: Last month, Rolling Stone published a story titled A Rape on Campus by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, which described a brutal gang rape of a woman named Jackie at a University of Virginia fraternity house; the universitys failure to respond to this alleged assault  and the schools troubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults. The story generated worldwide headlines and much soul-searching at UVA. University president Teresa Sullivan promised a full investigation and also to examine the way the school responds to sexual assault allegations. Because of the sensitive nature of Jackies story, we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed orchestrated the attack on her nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her. In the months Erdely spent reporting the story, Jackie neither said nor did anything that made Erdely, or Rolling Stones editors and fact-checkers, question Jackies credibility. Her friends and rape activists on campus strongly supported Jackies account. She had spoken of the assault in campus forums. We reached out to both the local branch and the national leadership of the fraternity where Jackie said she was attacked. They responded that they couldnt confirm or deny her story but had concerns about the evidence.  In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackies account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced. We were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account. We are taking this seriously and apologize to anyone who was affected by the story. Will Dana Managing Editor I should also note that Richard Bradley, a former editor at George  who, having been once bitten by Stephen Glasss faked articles, is now twice shy  was either the first journalist or among the first to suggest that there was something amiss about the Rolling Stone piece. His post was published on Nov. 24, 2014, five days after the original Rolling Stone article. "
The Washington Post,L,Many of the worst run states in the country are states hit the hardest by the housing crash - The Washington Post," By Hunter Schwarz December 5 at 5:09 PM  Follow @hunterschwarz      (AP Photo/The Star-News, Mike Spencer)  The effects of the housing crash are still being felt across the country. According to a ranking of the bestrun states, many of the bottom states saw a dramaticdecline in home values between 2009 and 2013. The list, compiled by 24/7 Wall Street, used a number of factors including unemployment, debt per capita, credit rating, and median household income to determine the ranking. Home values fell by at least 10 percent in five of the 10 bottom states: Arizona, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. In Illinois, which was the worst run state, the median home value fell by 16.2 percent, the second largest drop in the country. According to the study, more than 137,000 residents left Illinois between 2010 and 2013. Illinois also suffers from the highest level of unfunded pension liabilities and the worst credit rating from Moodys and S&P. New Mexico was ranked second-to-last, and like in Illinois, more people are moving out of the state than moving in, and nearly 22 percent of residents live in poverty, the second highest rate in the country. Mississippi, which has the lowest GDP in America, was third-from-last, followed byRhode Island, Kentucky, Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, Missouri, and Alabama. North Dakota was ranked the best run state."
The Washington Post,L,"NASAs Orion completes historic flight, ushers in new era - The Washington Post"," By Christian Davenport December 5 at 2:30 PM  Follow @_chrisdavenport        Orion, the NASA spacecraft designed to travel to asteroids and Mars, completed its first test flight on Friday, bringing NASA one step closer to a manned mission to the Red Planet. (AP)   NASA entered a new era of space exploration on Friday when its Orion capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean after going farther from the planet than any spacecraft built for humansin more than 40 years. The maiden test flight -- made without astronauts aboard -- is a step toward eventually getting astronauts to deep space: first to help snag an asteroid, and then, NASA hopes, to Mars. Orion lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., at 7:05 a.m., a day after gusty wind and problems with several valves forced officials to cancel the mission. But on Friday, the 4.5-hour mission appeared to go off flawlessly. ""There's your new spacecraft, America,"" said Mission Control commentator Rob Naviasshortly before Orion hit the water. As it sent back stunning images broadcast on NASAs website, Orion orbited the Earth twice, shot up to an altitude of about 3,600 miles above the Earth. That was farther than any spacecraft designed for humans had gone since the Apollo 17 moon mission in 1972. It splashed into the Pacific Ocean at 11:29 a.m.      NASA's Orion spacecraft landed with a perfect splashdown Friday following an unmanned test mission that broke records for being the fastest and furthest space fight in a craft built for humans since the Apollo moon missions. (AP)   The successful test flight was cheered by ebullient officials from NASA and its partners in the mission: prime contractor Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin, which built Orion, and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed and Boeing, which built the Delta IV Heavy rocket that launched Orion into orbit. Moments after liftoff, NASA spokesman Mike Curie said it marked ""the dawn of Orion and the new era of American space exploration."" In the post-flight press conference, Mark Geyer,NASA's Orion program manager, said: "" Its hard to have a better day than today."" And he describedthe Orion and the Delta IVas ""nearly flawless."" The images of Earth seen from such a great distance, he said,""reminded us here we are again now -- the United States leading exploration out into the solar system.""           1 of 19       Full Screen Autoplay  Close       Launch attempt on Thursday                    Skip Ad              Orion spacecraft launches    View Photos   NASAs next-generation unmanned capsule gets its first test flight.

But Friday'sflight went 15 times as far. NASA plans another test flight without astronauts in 2018. A crew is scheduledaboard Orion in about 2021. Sometime in the 2020s, NASA plans to capture anasteroid with a robotic spacecraft, then drag it to the moons orbit where it would connect with the Orion. Astronauts would then be able to take samples from the asteroid. ""Just the idea of having a human around the moon interacting with an asteroid -- thats mind boggling,"" NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden said Friday. ""We are very confident we can do this."" The big target, however, remains Mars, which NASA says astronauts could reach sometime in the 2030s. But for all the excitement of Fridays launch and talk of grand plans to go to Mars, NASA has been hampered by tight budgets and doesnt have the funding for a mission to the red planet. Critics say that the Mars mission exists on paper only. While the Orion was initially part of a program, called Constellation, designed to return to the moon, its mission changed afterthe Obama administration killed Constellation and made Mars the goal. Friday'smission used the Delta IV. But future Orion missions would use the new Space Launch System rocket, or SLS, which is still being developed. ""The SLS remains a big question mark -- both in terms of its development and funding, as well as political support,"" wrote Marco Caceres, a senior space analyst with the Teal Group, in his newsletter. ""Without the SLS,Orion is like a Cadillac without wheels."" Caceres and others have warned that the SLS project must be complete before a plausible timetable can be putonreaching Mars. ""Orion may be a starting point,"" he wrote. ""But it's a bit of a stretch to say we're on our way to Mars."" Friday's mission was designed to test some of Orion's riskiest systems, especially its heat shield, which withstood temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees when the capsule hit the atmosphere traveling at about 20,000 mph. Another big test was the series of parachutes designed to slow the capsule before it splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean off the Baja California coast. The test flight comes after theOctober explosion of an unmanned Orbital Sciences rocket that was to supply the space station and the recent crash of a Virgin Galactic spacecraftthat killed the co-pilot. Officials said before Friday's test flight that they were well aware of the risks involved in space flight. Mike Hawes, Lockheed's Orion program manager, said the data collected form the mission will be ""enormously helpful,"" as officials prepare for future flights. He also reflected on the beginning of his career, when he worked alongside officials from the Apollo mission. ""Weve now finally done something for the first time for our generation,"" he said. ""Its a good day.""     "
The Washington Post,L,New line of upscale Starbucks stores to take coffee to luxurious heights - The Washington Post,"   Barista Ryan McDonnell works at the coffee experience bar of the Starbucks Corp. Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle. The store is a 15,000-square-foot facility that combines a cafe with a coffee bean roastery. (David Ryder/Bloomberg)   By J.D. Harrison December 5 at 12:51 PM  Follow @jd_harrison    Starbucks has opened the first in a line of upscale stores pushing some of the rarest types of coffee from around the world, starting with a Willy Wonka-esque roastery and retail behemoth in the Capitol Hill neighborhood  not of the District  but of Seattle. Soon, though, there may be one near our own Capitol Hill. The company opened the doors Friday to its first Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, the flagship location for what executives envision as a chain of at least 100 high-end stores selling only the companys limited reserve coffee. Complete with two coffee bars, a restaurant, a bustling coffee factory, a two-story library and a theater, the new supermarket-sized location in Seattle is equal parts swanky eatery, tourist attraction and history museum for coffee and the Starbucks company. Its also where the company will roast, bag and ship more than 1 million pounds of its Reserve line of coffee products to outlets around the world. We have designed a space that will heighten all the senses, Liz Muller, vice president of creative and global design for Starbucks, said in a statement. Each visit will bring new discoveries while setting the standard for what customers can expect for the future of retail. You wont find any sign of the green-and-white mermaid logo at the stores, and Starbucks says not all future locations will include a roastery. They will feature upscale furnishings and sell only rare and relatively expensive coffee varieties. Aside from the planned D.C. location, stores are slated for Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. The news comes on the heels of the firms biennial investor conference, where a day earlier Starbucks announced that it will soon start allowing customers across the country to order on their smartphones before stepping into a Starbucks location. In some areas beginning late next year, the company also has plans to start offering delivery service. And the changes wont end there. As the company continues to peddle more food offerings, it plans to make beer and wine available in up to one-quarter of its U.S. stores over the next five years. This is the moment of the next generation of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, the companys chairman and chief executive, said in announcing the chain of Reserve stores. "

It really is about time, of course. Its about time we take a deeper, more effective look into the deaths of unarmed people, too often black men, at the hands of those who serve and protect. Because how many times must another person without weapon or (often) flight risk die till larger recurring problems are addressed? We should have no time for avoidable fatalities, even as the countless good cops protect the American right to nonviolently protest the killings and non-indictments in New York and in Ferguson, in Cleveland and shore to shore.

The Washington Post,L,U-Va. community struggles with latest twist in traumatic fall semester - The Washington Post," By Laura Vozzella and and Nick Anderson December 5 at 9:26 PM  Follow @LVozzella     CHARLOTTESVILLE  Students and faculty whipsawed by traumatic events in the fall semester at the University of Virginia confronted a sudden twist Friday as the credibility of a blockbuster magazine story about a gang rape on campus fell into doubt.  The Grounds, as the campus here is known, was jolted Nov. 19 by Rolling Stones account of a 2012 fraternity-house gang rape of a student named Jackie. Then the campus was galvanized as student activists and university leaders came together, pledging to reform whatever elements of U-Va.s culture might have facilitated sexual violence. The backdrop for these events was the communitys agony over the disappearance of sophomore Hannah Graham in September and the discovery weeks later that she had been slain.  Now the community wonders what to make of questions raised about the central incident in the Rolling Stone story after a detailed rebuttal from the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and an apology from the magazines managing editor. I felt like there was a healing process that was beginning and there was a moment when the rage and anger were morphing into self-reflection and healing, and now the healing process has been interrupted and attention has been focused on whats true and whats not true, Andrew Kaufman, a lecturer of Slavic languages and literature, said during a stop at a coffee shop. Students are scrambling to complete projects and prepare for final exams. They grabbed snatches of the latest developments from Facebook, smartphones and old-fashioned word-of-mouth. Many were bewildered. Its finals season, said Sabrina Song, 20, a junior who was walking in a chilly drizzle along University Avenue to turn in a portfolio of poems she wrote for a poetry class. Its hard to really figure out whats going on and reflect on it.  Its been a stressful first semester, said Michelle Lynskey, 18, a freshman who was walking past fraternity row. Since she arrived, Lynskey said, the university has held several rape-prevention programs, encouraging students to be active bystanders, and distributed T-shirts bearing the slogan, Whos got your back? Lynskey was wearing hers under a winter coat.  That made her believe the university was taking the issue seriously.  White Christmas lights twinkled on the columns in front of the Phi Kappa Psi house on Rugby Road, which has been the target of ire and demonstration since the story appeared. Students inside turned reporters away Friday afternoon, directing them to the formal comment from the fraternity. So touchy was the subject that a member of a neighboring house shooed a reporter off a walkway outside, saying he did not want his fraternity to get dragged into the matter. Several people said they were upset at Rolling Stones statement that its trust in the alleged victim had been misplaced. I believe Jackie  point blank, period, said Greg Lewis, 21, a senior. Whatever misreporting Rolling Stone did, thats not a Jackie problem. Anna Boynton, 21, another senior, also faulted the magazine. If there was a discrepancy ... they should have checked it out first and not thrown her under the bus a week later, she said. Rebecca Lim, editor-in-chief of student-run Cavalier Daily news outlet, said student journalists were hearing mixed reactions. Theres obviously some people who are angry, she said. And there are other people who are trying to redirect the conversation to the fact that rape is still a huge issue on college campuses. Taylor Sandridge, 21, who is not a student, works at a Dunkin Donuts on University Avenue that caters to the U-Va community. Like many here, she worries about what has happened to reputations  the fraternitys, the schools, the citys. The damage has already been done, she said.   Anderson reported from Washington.  "
The Washington Post,L,"Mike Green to miss sixth straight, sets mindframe on returning Tuesday - The Washington Post"," By Alex Prewitt December 5 at 5:09 PM  Follow @alex_prewitt      (Rob Carr/Getty Images)  NEWARK, N.J.  Defenseman Mike Green practiced for the second straight day with the Washington Capitals, continuing to regain strength after suffering an upper-body injury over two weeks ago, though he will miss Saturdays matchup here with the New Jersey Devils, Green said. Its frustrating because you hope its a day-to-day injury, Green said. At the most, five to six days. And here we are. Im anxious to get back, but weve got to be smart. Thats the last thing you want, is setbacks. Thats more frustrating than taking a day or two to make sure youre 100 percent. Green participated in limited segments Friday at AmeriHealth Pavilion, the Devils practice facility connected to the Prudential Center, mostly in non-contact situations. He did take part in one grind drill, as Coach Barry Trotz called it, but watched power play work from center-ice and still seemed lacking in power on passes and shots. Not much contact, but was able to gauge skating, shooting, Green said, confirming the injury occurred in a different area than the upper-body issue that sidelined him from the season-opener against Montreal. Its definitely coming along. Definitely not [back yet], but it definitely is coming for sure, so thats positive. When the Capitals decided to bring Green on their two-game road trip to Carolina and New Jersey, he was not expecting to be ready by Saturday. Instead, Green said, his mindframe was aimed at Tuesdays visit to Tampa Bay, once Washington returns home for a day off Sunday and practices in Ballston on Monday. Havent skated with the team, so didnt know how to gauge it, he said. After seeing the pace, doing a little bit of battling, its not quite ready for tomorrow. Dont want to be a hazard on the ice. Just getting that strength and being able to shoot completely and pass the puck firm and make the plays. The games so quick, youre going to get hit even harder if you cant move or make those plays. Without Green, Jack Hillen has started five straight games on the Capitals third defensive pairing beside Nate Schmidt. During that span, they have gone 2-2-1, most recently snapping a two-game losing streak against the Hurricanes. Neither Hillen nor Schmidt have recorded a point in Greens absence, but Green felt the blue line has held up well. With the system that we play, and the game plan we have as a defensive group, most nights everybodys great, he said. Theres not much room for error with the way we play. If there is, maybe its a puck that bounces over a stick or something. I think the defense has played really well over the last little bit here. Still, anytime the blue lines most efficient offensive weapon (1.64 points per 60 minutes) sits for five straight games, his lack of presencewill inevitably be felt. I think weve had a few issues at times where Mikes hands and Mikes experience would help us out a little bit on that third pair, Trotz said. But hes not there, so we cant worry about it."
The Washington Post,L,The Insiders: Who is Hillary kidding? - The Washington Post," By Ed Rogers December 5 at 6:33 PM  Follow @EdRogersDC      Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks at the Massachusetts Conference for Women in Boston, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)  Choosing to run for president means understanding everything the job entails  both the good and the bad  and deciding you are up for the adventure. By some accounts, Hillary Clinton is genuinely undecided about whether to run, but while we wait for her formal decision, she seems to be posing a little too hard. At the Massachusetts Conference for Women in Boston yesterday, she repeatedly emphasized how unforgiving and hard being president was, saying in part, Heres what I worry about. The stress on anybody in a leadership position, multiplied many times over to be president. The incoming never ends. Im a little skeptical. Is Clinton really trying to seem reluctant, to position herself as the candidate who doesnt really want to run but will sacrifice herself for the good of our country? Please. That is rich, especially considering the source. Its not quite as tone-deaf as saying she andBill were dead broke, but her act certainly strains credibility in suggesting she is wary of the burdens of the presidency. I do think there are some leaders who have been in close proximity to the presidency who dont crave the White House the way others do. Hillary Clinton could be in that category (as could Jeb Bush), but nothing about heractions to date suggest anything other than that she is already running. Nobody craves power and the presidency like the Clintons. Why pretend otherwise? Its not bad to be ambitious and want to be president. Many have been angling for the job for years. Fewwho have ever been elected president have wanted to leave the office. Stop the woe-is-me anguish and dont give us the phony martyr routine. Anyone who runs for president must avoid talking down to voters and acting like they are reluctantly willing to take on the toughest job. To be fair, this is not unique to Secretary Clinton. We will hear more false modestyfrom preening wannabes. I hope the handlers and 2016 candidates will have the discipline to spare us the theatrics. If the office really is just too much to bear, then save us the drama and do something else. Follow Ed on Twitter:@EdRogersDC "

The Washington Post,L,There is a second Eric Garner video. It may be more disturbing than the first. - The Washington Post," By Emily Badger December 5 at 4:52 PM  Follow @emilymbadger      Post by Taisha Allen.   There is a second Eric Garner video. It shows not the now-infamous scene that ultimately led to his death  the confrontation with New York Police Department officers, one grabbing Garner around his neck, Garner's body thrown to the ground  but the aftermath. For seven minutes, a disgusted bystander continues to film as Garner lies, unmoving, on the sidewalk, police officers involved in the incident milling around him. The video was originally posted on Facebook over the summer buthas received renewed attention after a grand jury decidednot to indict an officer involved in the altercation. As Harry Siegel at the New York Daily News points out, this video is almost more disturbing  or disturbing in a way that says something slightly different about Garner and the officers in question. About Garner: If he appears in the first video as the subject of police aggression, here he barely seems to warrant their attention at all. About the officers: They betray no sense of urgency or concern as they wait for first responders. It's as if the event were almost banal. The moment is much shorter than the four-and-a-half hours Michael Brown's body lay in the street after his death. But it says something similar, that the way we treat a body reflects how we value the life. "
The Washington Post,L,Millennials arent job hopping as much as previous generations. Heres why thats bad. - The Washington Post," By Jonnelle Marte December 5 at 12:30 PM  Follow @jonnelle      Amanda Healy, marketing manager for TIBCO Software Inc. in Boston, has worked for three employers over the past three years. Each change came with a significant boost in pay. (By Damian Strohmeyer for The Washington Post)  Amanda Healy has workedfor three companies in the last three years. Shes had her current job as a marketing manager forTIBCO Software Inc. for about eight months  and she hopes to stay there for the long run. But her stint at her previous employer lasted only 10 months. The 26-year-old says she isnt a habitual job hopper. (She was with her first employer for three and a half years.) But she thinks the moves she has made between employershave been vital to advancing her career  and growing her paycheck, 25 percent every time. Each move, even the internal ones she made at her first company, came with more responsibility. There was a gap in my skill set, and the next role really helped to fill that gap, Healy says of her recent job changes. Other workers her age havent been so lucky. For all the stereotypes that millennials are entitled, noncommittal job-hoppers, younger workers are actually staying in their jobs longer than previous generations did. In the late 1980s, about 50 percent of 20- to 25-year-olds changed jobs each year, but that dropped to 35 percent after the recession, according to an analysis by The Washington Post. Its not clear if millennials are holding on to those jobs by choice or if they are struggling to find better opportunities. But it is clear that staying put has a cost, mostly because of the kinds of jobs millennials are likely to land these days: lower-paying positions that often dont require a college degree. Median wages have stagnated ordecreased over the past decade in four of the five sectors hiring the most millennials today, according to a report issued this week by Young Invincibles, a group that focuses on the economic issues facing young workers.The only sector that saw a significant increase in pay was health care, where demand for workers is increasing. Pay cuts were particularly significant for people working in retail, where annual pay was $2,000 less than what it would have been 10 years ago. The data shows that millennials are taking jobs and keeping them, says Konrad Mugglestone, a policy analyst for Young Invincibles and a co-author of the report. But unfortunately, the jobs theyre taking are the ones that dont offer high wages, and they dont offer opportunities to grow. Jobhopping, when its possible, has emerged as one of the few ways to escape those lower wages, especially since the rewards that companies have historically offered for employee loyalty  pensions and pay raises  continue todiminish. Take raises, for instance. Wages are projected to grow by 0.3 percent in thefourth quarter from a year ago, according to PayScale, a company that tracks salary information. That is down from the 2.9 percent increase seen in the fourth quarter of 2007. And traditional pensions, once a bastion of retirement security offered to long-term employees, are now only offered to new hires by seven percent of Fortune 500 companies, down from about 50 percent in 1998, according to benefits consulting firm Towers Watson.All of that means that employees dont get as much for staying with the same company for long. In the baby boomer generation, everybody had pensions, and that really facilitated lifelong commitments to a company, says Melissa Murray Bailey,a president with Universum, a research and consulting company. As companies have done less and less of that there really is less of a mutual expectation that people will make that commitment. And since pay is actually worse for them than it was for similar workers years ago, millennials are at risk of being worse off financially than their parents were.Data released by theCensus Bureauon Thursday showed thatmillennials arent much better off when compared to their older colleagues.     Young workers todayare more educated than previous generations were. But theyre also less likely to have a job and more prone to living in poverty. The typical 18- to 34-year-old makes $2,000 less annually when compared to younger workers in 1980, the study found, though the difference is much bigger in some states. Millennials have developed a reputation for caring more than previous generations about finding a job that matches their passions. But pay is becoming more important as young workers look tomove out of their parents homes or pay off their student loan debt, says Dan Schawbel,founder of the research and consulting firm Millennial Branding. The economy has forced millennials to focus more on money than things they used to prioritize, like work flexibility, he says. Things may be looking up. Hiring is on the rise, and millennials are benefiting from some of those job gains, with the unemployment rate for 25 to 34 year olds dropping to 6.1 percent in November from 7.4 percent a year earlier, according to the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And more people are changing jobs, according to a separatereport released last month, which is usually viewed as a signof optimism in the job market. Of course, moving from a company too quickly has its downsides. Some workers may find they are leaving before they can complete a big project or develop lastingrelationships with their colleagues  things that are also vital for career advancement. Healy says thats why she hopes to stay a while with her current employer. She wasnt actively searching for a job when the opportunity came up and was hesitant to leave her last company, where she was tasked with responsibilities, such as event planning and budget management, that she enjoyed. Butthe job offer from TIBCO came with a chance to manage people, an opportunity she hadnt had before. As a way to maximize her experience with both employers, Healy negotiated to push back the start date on her new job by a month so that she would be able to finish up aproject with her previous employer. Of course, many millennials who are moving from job to job are yearning for something more permanent.Some young people are finding themselves stuck in jobs that dont require the college degrees theyve gone into debt for. And, as my colleague Matt OBrien has reported, the low wages associated with those jobs can drag down pay even later in their careers.

The Washington Post,L,4 reasons to reject the racist Dutch tradition of Zwarte Piet - The Washington Post," By Ishaan Tharoor December 5 at 6:31 PM  Follow @ishaantharoor      Sinterklaas (L) and a Zwarte Piet (R) wave as they arrive in Gouda, the Netherlands, Nov. 15,2014. (EPA/REMKO DE WAAL)  Saturday marks the feast day of St. Nicholas. The day prior is one of the most festive occasions in the Netherlands: theapex of the nation's tradition of Sinterklaas, when theprogenitor of the American Santa Claus, lofted atop a white steed, distributes cookies and gifts to children with the aid of a gaggle of helper minions. The assistants -- some call them servants or even slaves -- are known as Zwarte Piets, or Black Petes. Each year, myriad Dutch people wear frilly wigs, paint their lips red and blacken their faces in fond emulation of the Zwarte Piet character, known for his antic japes.Donning blackface is an act discouraged in most Western societies, onewith deeply racist connotations. In a WorldViews piece last month, I looked at the growing backlash against the Zwarte Piet tradition.Though a vast majority of the Dutch population support it, there's an increasingly vocal activist community that wants the rest of the country to wake up to the awkward bigotry embedded in the Zwarte Piet character. Earlier this year, a Dutch filmmaker dressed up as Zwarte Piet and gamboled around a park in London, much to the bemused horror of local residents. They, including British celebrity Russell Brand, seem incredulous at the persistence of the Dutch tradition. ""Are you taking the piss,"" asks one London park-goer. ""This is offensive, this is terrible,"" says another.  Yet after I published my post on WorldViews, I was deluged with vitriol from Dutch readers defending Zwarte Piet. For the sake of clarity, I've distilled the main arguments hurled my way below into four points, and tried to rebut all of them. Here's why one shouldn't be afraid to say that Zwarte Piet is unfit for the 21st century. It's about mythical figures, not black people.Many insisted that I was theracist to evenassociate Zwarte Piet with ""blackness."" It's a legacy of pagan times, one critic wrote -- the Zwarte Piets are wood spirits accompanying Woden. Which is why they wear 17th-century minstrel attire and have afros, right? Others say his skin is black from falling down a chimney -- but then why are his clothes not also sooty? Another more serious argument contends that Piets are supposed to be Moors-- North African Arabs --brought on a ship from Spain by Sinterklaas. Even then, that hardly makes it better:as WorldViews discussed in an earlier post, Moors haunted the European imagination for centuries as a kind of spectral evil. If you're a white Europeanblackening your face as a Moor, you're still stigmatizing the Other, and traipsingdown the same slippery slope. And let's bereal, how is Zwarte Piet not about blackness? Examine these 19th-century and early 20th-century sketches of Zwarte Piet,from a beloved Dutch children's book that has come to define the tradition. Look at this in the larger context of Europe's depictions of Africans and the African body around the same time. Then consider the Dutch history of slavery and the nation'sconsiderable role in establishing that grim trade across the Atlantic. Finally, askwhy there seems to beno trace whatsoever of Zwarte Piet in Sinterklaas celebrations that take place in New York's historic Dutch heartland. Minorities are fine with it.Sure, a few Dutch minorities have spoken up in defense of the tradition. That doesn't diminish the offense taken by others. Race is a complicated matter, particularly in those societies shaped bythe history of empire andslavery. Do the voices of those saying the tradition is racist not matter? Shouldthe hundreds of protesters last month -- and the 90 who were arrested -- campaigning against Zwarte Piet be ignored? This year, heeding protesters, Dutch expatriates in Sweden opted not to represent Piet as a painted, black figure. (If he's just a lovable trickster, why does he have to any one particular color?) And it really doesn't help that some of the Netherlands' most controversial bigots are Zwarte Piet's most outspokenfans.    A taxi driver has a sign reading ""Black Pete Is Racism"" as he waits for customers during the arrival and parade of Saint Nicholas and his black-faced sidekick Zwarte Piet, or ""Black Pete"", in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Nov. 16, 2014.(Peter Dejong/AP)  It's a children's tradition that hasnoracist intent.This was a common refrain. ""We grew up with Zwarte Piet,"" it's ""harmless.""But just because you don't think you're racist does not mean a custom you practice can't have racist connotations. When many outsiders look on aghast with horror, it should be a moment for reflection. The simple fact that some things are ""traditions"" is never a justification for theircontinued existence -- particularly, as my colleague Karen Attiah writes, if ""they wereborn during a time when people of color were relegated to being lower-class citizens and especially if they perpetuate that prejudice."" Zwarte Piet may now be ""a lame, thoughtless thing,"" writesAmerican academic John McWhorter. But it carries with it the""implication that all [the history of]slavery and servitude and imperialism was some kind of cartoon."" That is enough causeto condemn it. Look at how much more racist the U.S. is.Quite a few Dutch commenters on Twitter and other platforms questioned whether an American publication has any right to scold the Netherlands for racism given the U.S.'s far more glaringhistory of racial tensions. The events of recent weekshave reinforced how farAmericans arefrom living in the post-racial societythey sometimes dream they inhabit. But that can't shield other societies from rebuke. The Netherlands is widely admired for its culture of liberalism and tolerance. But it has problems as well. The U.S. had to move beyond its own ugly traditions of blackfaceand, perhaps in just this one instance, the Dutch should pay attention."
The Washington Post,L,Venezuelas Maduro indicts opposition leader as economic forces conspire against him - The Washington Post," By Nick Miroff December 5 at 5:21 PM  Follow @nickmiroff      Maria Corina Machado, who backed anti-government protests this year, has been charged inan alleged plot to kill President Nicolas Maduro. (EFE)  Oil prices are tanking and inflation is running wild, but Venezuela was swept up this week in a new political sideshow: charges of ""conspiracy"" against opposition leader and former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado. Machado was indicted Wednesday along with several other opposition figures who exchanged e-mails discussing alleged plans to ""annihilate"" President Nicolas Maduro in the midst of violent anti-government protests this year. Machado has acknowledged that she wrote the e-mails, but said she was referring to Maduro's political not physical  annihilation. She called the accusations ""grotesque"" and ""a mockery"" in commentspublished Friday by Venezuela's El Nacional. ""In Venezuela, proof isn't necessary for someone to be charged, nor is a crime necessary for someone to be jailed,"" she said. Prosecutors have cited Venezuelan laws that lay out prison terms of 8 to 16 years for ""anyone who, inside or outside the national territory, conspires to destroy the republican political character of the nation."" In a televised interview Friday morning, a communications ministry official, Tania Diaz, said she also possessed intercepted phone calls in which Machado allegedly exhorted protesters to violence, and accused her of trying to foment ""civil war."" Machado has not been taken into custody. But if jailed, she would be the second major opposition figure to be locked away on charges of trying to overthrow the Maduro government during the street demonstrations that flared then fizzled out earlier this year. At least 43 were killed, including protesters and government security forces, during three months of street clashes. Leopoldo Lopez, a co-founder with Machado of the ""Popular Will"" party, has been held in a military prison since February, drawing criticism from the United Nations Committee Against Torture. ""We are deeply concerned by what appears to be the Venezuelan government's continuing effort to intimidate its political opponents through abuse of the legal process,"" U.S. State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said in a statementfollowing Machado's indictment. ""The charges against Machado raise concerns once again about Venezuela's arbitrary use of prosecutorial powers to silence and punish government critics,"" Harf said. U.S. lawmakers from both parties echoedthose criticisms. The Obama administration has recently said it would support economic sanctions targeting members of the Maduro administration and Venezuelan security forces. Though she is one of the most visible leaders of Venezuela's opposition, Machado has less of a political following than Lopez or governor Henrique Capriles, who narrowly lost to Maduro in the April 2013 presidential election. Machado was stripped of her national assembly seat by Maduro's ruling party this year when she testified at a special session of the Organization of American States denouncing the Maduro government for right abuses. In a speech this week, Maduro called her ""a murderer."" The embattled president  the hand-picked successor of the late Hugo Chavez  faces an increasingly grim economic outlook. The price of Venezuelan crudeoil the source of nearly all government revenue fell below $62 Friday, its lowest level in five years. The unofficial exchange rate for Venezuelan bolivars jumped to 170 per dollar, up from 95 at the start of last month, and Venezuelans are facing shortages of food, medicines and other basics. A survey by the leading polling firm Datanalisis said Maduro's approval rating slipped in November to 24.5 percent. More than 85 percent of those surveyed said the country was headed in the wrong direction. Maduro's government has yet to set a date for next year's parliamentary elections."

The Washington Post,L,How Rolling Stone failed in its story of alleged rape at the University of Virginia - The Washington Post," By Paul Farhi December 5 at 7:11 PM  Follow @farhip    Journalists are paid to be skeptical and to distinguish facts from assertions: Dont get too close to your sources and check what they tell you. Rolling Stone magazine, it appears, ignored both principles in its explosive story, A Rape on Campus.   The 9,000-word article about Jackie, a University of Virginia freshman who alleged a frat-house gang rape, was apparently fraught from the beginning with gaps in basic reporting. The storys writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, as well as a phalanx of editors, fact-checkers and lawyers who massaged the piece before publication, accepted Jackies account without locking down key details that would have confirmed, or at least plausibly substantiated, her harrowing tale. Instead, Erdelys story, published Nov.19 to a thunderous and mostly positive reaction, appears to have been fatally defective. Major details, including the name of the fraternity in question, are in dispute or have been exposed as false. Jackies allies have distanced themselves from her and from Rolling Stones story. And so, too, has Rolling Stone. The magazine backed away from the story Friday and placed the onus for its defects on Jackie. In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackies account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced, wrote managing editor Will Dana in A Note to Our Readers posted on the magazines Web site. (The magazine did not return calls for further comment.) He also wrote, Because of the sensitive nature of Jackies story, we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed orchestrated the attack on her nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her. Which, like the story itself, is not entirely accurate.  In interviews with The Washington Post and Slate, Erdely never asserted that she had agreed not to speak to the men in question  only that she wouldnt name them in her story or talk about them afterward. Jackie asked me not to name the individuals because shes so fearful of them, she told The Post. That was something we agreed to. She was nervous to name the fraternity, too. I told her, If were trying to shine light on this, we have to name the fraternity. In fact, Erdely and her editor, Sean Woods, later acknowledged that the magazine had tried to find the men but failed to do so. We did not talk to them, Woods said. We could not reach them. That should have been a red flag. In essence, neither writer nor editor could warrant that the men alleged to have committed a terrible crime actually existed.  Thats not to say that Rolling Stone should have abandoned the story altogether. But it does suggest the need for more reporting before going to press. The failure to ascertain the whereabouts of key actors in such a revolting drama left Rolling Stone not with she said/he said ambiguity  a feature of every alleged crime or scandal  but with half a story, told from a single viewpoint. Except for two vague, inconclusive quasi-denials by the president of the local Phi Kappa Psi chapter and the executive director of the fraternity, no aspect of Jackies story was rebutted. Indeed, wrote Dana, In the months Erdely spent reporting the story, Jackie neither said nor did anything that made Erdely, or Rolling Stones editors and fact-checkers, question Jackies credibility. Her friends and rape activists on campus strongly supported Jackies account. But friends and activists have little incentive to be skeptical; thats the reporters job. To be sure, Rolling Stone was under no obligation to prove that Jackies account was true. That is a standard that eludes even the most rigorous trials, with eyewitness testimony and expert witnesses. News organizations, however, are responsible for independently verifying details, ascertaining facts, rooting out discrepancies and determining whether the discrepancies it finds are substantial enough to discredit a story. How, for example, could Jackie recognize some of the men she said assaulted her in a room Erdely described as pitch black? How could she have exited the fraternity house via an entrance that, upon inspection, would have been shown not to exist? Did a party really take place at the fraternity on Sept.28, 2012? (The fraternity maintains it did not.) If so, what did some of the partygoers, if not the alleged rapists, remember about that night? No such recollections were cited, leaving readers to wonder whether anyone was asked in the first place. Erdely also adopted the voice of her protagonist as she described the alleged events. The style is common in magazine writing; newspapers are wary of it, lest it give too much credence to one perspective rather than multiple viewpoints. You can have voice if the underlying facts check out, said Emily Bell, professor of professional practice at Columbia Universitys School of Journalism. But you have to have the facts. [This] was a factual failing, not a presentational one.Voice is a secondary issue. Erdely herself deflected questions about her reporting by engaging in a bit of misdirection. When asked repeatedly by The Post last week about her contacts with Drew  the purported ringleader of the gang rape  she demurred, citing her non-disclosure agreement with Jackie. Her answer left the impression that she had indeed had such contact with Drew, but was bound not to talk about it. The magazine could also have disclosed to its readers what it did not know and what its reporting could not show. The story didnt disclose, for example, that Erdely couldnt find Drew, nor a second fraternity member who Jackie identified.   Such caveats may weaken the overall narrative, but they help readers understand how strong the narrative is in the first place. Theres another basic principle in journalism: Every story has two sides. In fact, every story has many sides. Rolling Stone decided to run with just one of them. To its everlasting regret. "
The Washington Post,L,New U.S. military command established for Iraq and Syria operations - The Washington Post," By Dan Lamothe December 5 at 5:19 PM  Follow @danlamothe      A formation of U.S. Navy F-18E Super Hornets leaves after receiving fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker over northern Iraq, September 23, 2014. These aircraft were part of a large coalition group that was the first to strike Islamic State targets in Syria. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Shawn Nickel)  The U.S. military has established a new command that will oversee operations in both Iraq and Syria, military officials said Friday. Combined Joint Task Force  Operation Inherent Resolve has taken charge of the mission in both countries. It is led by Army Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, the commanding general of U.S. Army Central. That organization oversees Army operations across the Middle East, including in Iraq. Terry was expected to provide a briefing to the media on the changes on Friday morning at the Pentagon, but it was postponed as President Obama was announcing former deputy defense secretary Ashton B. Carter as his nominee to be the next secretary of defense around the same time. Terry is based in the Middle East, defense officials said, but they declined to say in which country. The United States has a military presence in the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Irbil, and in neighboring Kuwait. The military has provided few details about the new task force, but said in a news release Friday that it will replace U.S. Central Command as the organization releasing information about the mission. The United States has launched hundreds of airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State in recent months. From Dec. 3 to Dec. 5, U.S. attack and bomber aircraft launched six airstrikes in Syria. The U.S., in conjunction with other countries, also launched 14 airstrikes in Iraq from Dec. 3 to Dec. 5 in Iraq, U.S. military officials said."
The Washington Post,L,The marijuana industry is following the trail blazed by Big Tobacco - The Washington Post,"   DENVER - APRIL 20: A woman holds a joint at a pro-marijuana ""4/20"" celebration in front of the state capitol building April 20, 2010 in Denver, Colorado. (John Moore/GETTY IMAGES)   By Samuel T. Wilkinson December 5 at 8:09 PM     Samuel Wilkinson is a resident physician at the Yale School of Medicine.   Last month, people voted to legalize recreational use of marijuana in Oregon, Alaska and the District. As the movement toward marijuana legalization continues, lawmakers and policy experts are looking to the experiments in Colorado and Washington for guidance. We should not overlook, however, valuable lessons from our experience with another legal drug: tobacco. In the late 19th century, the landscape of tobacco consumption was very different than it is today. Tobacco use was much less prevalent, and cigarettes accounted for a tiny portion of consumption. Yet by the mid-20th century almost half of U.S. adults smoked, with major consequences for public health. Despite important health policy achievements since, cigarette smoking remains a major contributor to the top causes of death in the United States, including cardiovascular and lung diseases, as well as cancer.  This drastic rise in the prevalence of smoking can be attributed to a number of successful business strategies. Hand-rolling of cigarettes, a technique that limited production potential, was supplanted by machine manufacturing. Changes in the chemical composition and curing process of cigarettes made them more flavorful as well as more addictive. Aggressive marketing techniques sought to build a larger consumer base. Advertisements often featured doctors in an effort to quell public fear over smoking-related health concerns; other campaigns targeted children or adolescents, who represented potential lifetime customers. Finally, the industry created powerful lobbying groups to protect their profits from regulations aimed at curbing consumption.  Alarmingly, marijuana businesses are now mimicking many of Big Tobaccos successful strategies. New methods of consuming marijuana (such as vaporization) are said to represent a healthier way to get high  though little research supports this claim  encouraging individuals to consume more marijuana in one sitting. The percentage of tetrahydrocannabinol (the euphoria-inducing compound associated with many adverse health effects) in marijuana is much higher than it was a few decades ago. Just as tobacco companies featured doctors in advertisement campaigns, marijuana advocates have appealed to medical authority by successfully lobbying in many places for the approval of medical marijuana for a plethora of conditions, even when little or no scientific evidence supports its use. While it is laudable that Colorado has placed restrictions on marijuana advertising, it is also disturbing that the marijuana industry quickly mounted powerful legal efforts to challenge these restrictions in court.  The formula for success in profiting from a legal drug is simple and has been clearly outlined by Big Tobacco: Identify a product with addictive potential, aggressively market it to as large an audience as possible, develop technical innovations to allow for and promote increased consumption, and deny or minimize potential costs to human health. The marijuana industry is poised to copy this formula, with dire consequences. Important lessons can also be drawn from the Netherlands , where marijuana has been decriminalized since 1976. Following decriminalization, the Dutch government strictly enforced guidelines prohibiting advertising and transactions above a certain quantity (to discourage mass production and distribution). For about a decade, marijuana consumption rates remained stable. However, in the mid-1980s, waning enforcement of these guidelines coincided with a drastic increase in both the commercialization of marijuana and rates of consumption. The overriding lesson from the Netherlands is that it was commercialization, not decriminalization itself, that led to sharp increases in use.  If we are intent on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, lessons from the tobacco industry and the Dutch marijuana experiment suggest that we do so in a way that does not pit corporate incentives against the interests of public health. Similar to efforts in Uruguay, production and distribution should be done solely by the government so as to ensure that there is no corporate incentive to entice more people to consume marijuana in larger quantities. Advertisements in all media venues should be banned, or as stringently regulated as allowed by law.  While the health effects of marijuana are generally not as severe as those of cigarette smoking, the consequences  including addiction, psychosis and impaired cognitive abilities  are nonetheless real. Notably, these effects are most pronounced in children and adolescents. Claims that marijuana legalization will make it easier to prevent use by minors are not backed by scientific or historical evidence. The most prevalent drugs consumed by teenagers are those that are legal: alcohol and tobacco. This should give us pause to consider the optimal way to legalize marijuana  and indeed whether other states should consider legalization at all.

The Washington Post,L,What was fake on the Internet this week: Dog whisperer death and the Zodiac Killer - The Washington Post,"

Cesar Millan will live to dog-whisper another day. (NGC/ITV Studios Ltd)

There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that weve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake pumpkin-spice products. Amazing viral video? Nope  a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!
So rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week,wereroundingthem all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probablyshouldntshare over the weekend.
Ready? Heres what was fake on the Internet this week:
1. Neither Axl Rose nor the Dog Whisperer are dead. Welp, this week was a double-whammy for death hoaxes: Both Axl Rose, the Guns N Roses frontman, and Cesar Millan, the fanatically beloved dog-trainer, suffered untimely ends this week, per two separate fake-news sites. Roses death was reported on MSNBC.website, which has no affiliation with MSNBC and exists solely to propagate highly convincing news hoaxes. To that end, it doesnt even have a home page  its creators apparently just publish one-off, individual articles with the hope that readers wont scrutinize them closely. (That strategy works  MSNBC.website is also the site that brought you the news of Macaulay Culkins death.)
The dog-whisperer hoax also came from a sneaky source: On Tuesday, the Spanish-language site UNAM Noticias posted a report that Millan had suffered a heart attack and died at Santa Clarita Hospital in California. UNAM Noticias openly admits that its not a real news site  the site  is a satirical newspaper whose only purpose is entertainment, a disclaimer reads  but it does so in Spanish. The Millan report, meanwhile, was written in English, which perhaps explains how it was shared some 45,000 times. (Like I said: very sneaky.)
Rose and Millan both took to social media to debunk the claims. Reports of my pack leaders untimely demise are greatly exaggerated, reads a Facebook post from Millans dog. Rose, meanwhile, had this to say:
If Im dead do I still have to pay taxes? Axl Rose (@axlrose) December 4, 2014


2. A Ferguson protester did not carry a signreadingno mother should have to fear for her sons life every time he robs a store. Rather, the inflammatory meme is the result of some politically motivated Photoshopping  pretty convincing Photoshopping, but totally fake nonethless. St. Louiss Riverfront Times reports that a photographer for the paper originally took the photo of protester Jarmell Hasson last month, when he was out holding a sign that read no mother should have to fear for her sons life every time heleaves home. (Emphasis ours.)But an Imgur user, going by the handle Bdawgid, apparently grabbed the photo and edited the new, fake text in  a bit of fakeryhe admitted to on Imgur later. Unfortunately, that confession did not stop thousands of people from sharing the doctored image as real; on Facebook, one local posted it with the caption You cant make this up!!!! Needless to say, you can (!!!!).
#Ferguson PROTEST SIGN SAYS IT ALL! No Mother Should Have to Fear For Her Sons Life Every Time He Robs A Store. pic.twitter.com/nCnxUqjDP0 DelcoGal (@DelcoGal) December 1, 2014


3. Posting a privacy notice to Facebook does absolutely nothing. In the latest round of a futile memethat repeats with every update to Facebooks privacy policy, thousands of users have posted a so-called privacy notice thatclaimsto protect their legal rights to everything they put on the site. (One representative version: I declare that my rights are attached to all my personal data, drawings, paintings, photos, texts etc.  published on my profile. For commercial use of the foregoing my written consent is required at all times.)
Alas, all these privacy rebels are posting in vain: When you sign up for a Facebook account, you agree to a packet of privacy and data-use terms, and those are the ones that are officially binding. Making a status update after the fact doesnt alter the terms of your original contract with Facebook, no matter the fancy-sounding legalese.
4. The author of The Fault in Our Stars is not the Zodiac Killer. This should be fairly obvious, given that the Zodiac Killer operated in the 1960s and 70s  years before the 37-year-old author, John Green, was even born. The mathematics of the thing did not, however, dissuadetongue-in-cheek Tumblr-users frompointing out the (very approximate) resemblance between Green and a sketch artists portrayal of the serial murderer. From there, the meme made its way to Twitter and Wikipedia, where Greens page briefly described him as a serial killer who operated in Northern California. The record has since been corrected, and moderators have locked down Greens biography.
I usually hate the dumb memes on tumblr but Im really enjoying this John Green is the Zodiac Killer thing. pic.twitter.com/rWDStPsdaJ Cain (@TruculentTexan) December 3, 2014


5. The Koch brothers did not buy NPR. An image posted last week by Vocal Progressives  a Facebook page that manufactures memes and other interactives for progressives and Democrats  claims that Charles and David Koch, the divisiveand deep-pocketed owners of Koch Industries, made a large donation to NPR shortly before the station slashed its coverage of climate change.
Virtually every clause in the proceeding statement is untrue: the Kochs have not donated to NPR, despite headlines to that effect, and NPR hasnt stopped reporting on the environment; its just shifted the way it organizes reporterson those beats. (Snopes has much more on all that,if youre intrigued.)This particular meme hasnt circulated too widely  it has, of this writing, under 3,000Facebook shares  but its an example of a genre that definitely gets around. When it comes to hyper-partisan Facebook meme-factories, on either side of the political spectrum, poster beware.

The Washington Post,L,The DOJs jaw-dropping report about the Cleveland Police Department - The Washington Post," By Radley Balko December 5 at 5:32 PM  Follow @radleybalko      U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder (L) and Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta (R) listen as U.S. Attorney Steve Dettlebach speaks at a press conference on December 4, 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo by Angelo Merendino/Getty Images)  The Department of Justice has released a report of its investigation into the Cleveland Police Department. My Post colleague Emily Badger beat me to the punch on this, but the findings are staggering. Our investigation concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that CDP engages ina pattern or practice of using unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. That pattern manifested in a range of ways, including:  The unnecessary and excessive use of deadly force, including shootings and head strikeswith impact weapons; The unnecessary, excessive or retaliatory use of less lethal force including tasers,chemical spray and fists; Excessive force against persons who are mentally ill or in crisis, including in cases wherethe officers were called exclusively for a welfare check; and The employment of poor and dangerous tactics that place officers in situations whereavoidable force becomes inevitable and places officers and civilians at unnecessary risk.   In other words, the department fails in just about every possible measurable way. And it goes on like that: . . . we found incidents of CDP officers firing theirguns at people who do not pose an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury to officersor others and using guns in a careless and dangerous manner, including hitting people on thehead with their guns, in circumstances where deadly force is not justified. Officers also use lesslethal force that is significantly out of proportion to the resistance encountered and officers toooften escalate incidents with citizens instead of using effective and accepted tactics to de-escalatetension. We reviewed incidents where officers used Tasers,3 oleoresin capsicum spray (OCSpray), or punched people who were already subdued, including people in handcuffs. Many ofthese people could have been controlled with a lesser application of force. At times, this forceappears to have been applied as punishment for the persons earlier verbal or physical resistanceto an officers command, and is not based on a current threat posed by the person. Thisretaliatory use of force is not legally justified. Our review also revealed that officers useexcessive force against individuals who are in mental health crisis or who may be unable tounderstand or comply with officers commands, including when the individual is not suspectedof having committed any crime at all. In addition to the pattern or practice of excessive force, we found that CDP officerscommit tactical errors that endanger both themselves and others in the Cleveland communityand, in some instances, may result in constitutional violations. They too often fire their weaponsin a manner and in circumstances that place innocent bystanders in danger; and accidentally firethem, sometimes fortuitously hitting nothing and other times shooting people and seriouslyinjuring them. CDP officers too often use dangerous and poor tactics to try to gain control of suspects, which results in the application of additional force or places others in danger.Critically, officers do not make effective use of de-escalation techniques, too often insteadescalating encounters and employing force when it may not be needed and could be avoided.While these tactical errors may not always result in constitutional violations, they place officers,suspects, and other members of the Cleveland community at risk. The department also fails at holding cops accountable after the fact. Force incidents often are not properly reported, documented,investigated, or addressed with corrective measures. Supervisors throughout the chain ofcommand endorse questionable and sometimes unlawful conduct by officers. We reviewedsupervisory investigations of officers use of force that appear to be designed from the outset tojustify the officers actions. Deeply troubling to us was that some of the specially-trainedinvestigators who are charged with conducting unbiased reviews of officers use of deadly forceadmitted to us that they conduct their investigations with the goal of casting the accused officerin the most positive light possible. This admitted bias appears deeply rooted, cuts at the heart ofthe accountability system at CDP, and is emblematic of the type of practice that justifies afinding under Section 14141. In fact, the relevant internal department responsible for investigating deadly force incidents hasnt conducted a single investigation since 2012. More disturbing still, the DOJ issued a similar report a mere decade ago about the same department. Theres only so much the department can do. At some point, its up to the people of Cleveland. Hopefully it wont take too many more dead kids or multimillion dollar settlements for residents to demand that political leaders install police officials who take a more constitution-friendly approach to law enforcement."
The Washington Post,L,Crazy: At least 1 in every 10 robberies involves the theft of a phone - The Washington Post," By Brian Fung December 5 at 10:54 AM  Follow @b_fung      (jhaymesisvip)  Maybe it's happened to you before: You're in a cab or at a restaurant and you accidentally leave your smartphone behind. By the time you've realized it's missing, it's too late: Some enterprising thief has pilfered your device. Many phones come with remote wiping or locking features, so that if the unthinkable happens you can keep prying eyes from accessing your files. The largest cellular networks in the country have also voluntarily agreed to add such features in all new smartphones made after July 2015. But now the Federal Communications Commission wants to cement that agreement  and on a much faster timetable. In letters sent to Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular on Thursday, agency chairman Tom Wheeler asked the companies to make ""'lock/wipe/restore' functionality operational by default onall devices  by the end of the first quarter of 2015."" An FCC study this week concluded that thieves steal more than a million phones a year. Of all robberies committed annually in the United States, about one in 10 involves the theft of a mobile device, according to the report. Even those figures are probably incomplete, given that the FCC drew its data from just 21 jurisdictions (albeit along with information from the FBI). SoWheeler is also asking the carriers to collect better data about how many phones get stolen on a regular basis, and when. Unsurprisingly, wireless lobbyists are pushing back against what it calls the""artificial deadline"" set by the FCC. ""The relevant state laws and the [industry]voluntary commitment contemplate new solutions in July 2015,"" saidJamie Hastings, an executive at the industry association CTIA. ""The[FCC study]made no reference to implementing any specific recommendations by the end of the first quarter of 2015, and it is unclear why the FCC chairmans letter to some stakeholders appears to shift that timetable."" Either way, it appears that you'll soon be able to erase your phone remotely if it ever leaves your possession  no matter which national carrier you choose. "
The Washington Post,L,Rolling Stone fiasco hurts rape victims and journalists - The Washington Post," By Diana Reese December 5 at 4:42 PM Follow @dianareese      Audience members hold signs during a board of visitors meeting about sexual assault at the University of Virginia on Nov. 25 in Charlottsville, Va. (Ryan M. Kelly/The Daily Progress via AP)  I dont know now whether Jackie, the young woman profiled in A Rape on Campus, was actually gang raped at a University of Virginia fraternity party. But I fear that the credibility of not only rape victims, but also ofjournalists reporting on campus sexual assault, has been damaged with that story, retracted by Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana. On Friday, hewrote: In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies inJackies account, and we have come to the conclusion thatour trust in her was misplaced. Why didnt Rolling Stone insist on additional reporting from journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely, and why didnt editors do the fact-checking such a story not only deserves but requires? What about the publics trust in journalism? Social media is lit up with comments defending Jackie, while others attack her and all women who cry rape, as some of these commenters put it. I am sad and I am angry, because the furordraws attentionaway from campus sexual assault, a subject Ive written on extensively, following the work of Sen. Claire McCaskill, and the tragic suicides of high school girls such asRehtaeh Parsonsand Audrie Pott. Many of us believe that campus sexual assault is a very real problem, and Erdely wanted to prove it. I can understand that desire to convince the public. Earlier this year, I was contacted by a grad student at a prestigious West Coast university. She had been raped in her dorm room by a fellow student, she told me, and she included photos of her bruises and other injuries. She sent me a detailed, multipage, first-person account, the police report and names of legal professors who were fighting for her case. Yet the prosecuting attorney declined to press charges. School officials, at least, had worked out schedules and even walking routes across campus so that she would never have to see the man who had allegedly assaulted her. I could have written one hell of a story. It would have made compelling copy, a dramatic piece that you couldnt put down until youd reached the end. But I didnt know ifI could provethatit was true. It would have required extensive reporting, something more appropriate for an in-depth investigative piece. The young woman was willing to go public with her name. She wanted some sort of justice for whatever had happened, and I felt sorry for her. Shed taken an academic leave of absence and didnt know whethershe would return to school. But the problem of rape on our college campuses is too serious and too real to risk diverting attention with any potentially false accusation or even with detailing a case that cannot stand up to scrutiny. How many times have I heard people invoke Duke lacrosse team whenever rape is mentioned? The very nature of the crime of rape makes it difficult to prove. It often goes unreported because women dont want to go through the aftermath of reporting the crime, whether its to unfeeling police interrogating the victim, or across-examination in a courtroom if the case actually goes that far. Women risk becoming social pariahs on campus, especially if the alleged perpetrator is a popular athlete. I have no doubt that rape happens to high school girls and to college students. My best friends daughter was raped at a party by hockey players and then shamed in high school by those who decided that she had beenasking for it. Two suicide attempts and six years later, shes still struggling with PTSD and other mental health problems triggered by that night. Ive known this young woman since she was 7and Im convinced that shes telling the truth but that isnt enough for me to write a feature-length piece about her in the pages of Rolling Stone or The Washington Post. What I write here is commentary, although I fact-check and report as much as possible to provide a foundation of truth. We have to have the highest standards possible in our profession, despite the proliferation of the ever-hungry 24-hour news cycle and despite the unrelenting competition to grab readers attention. At the end of the day, we have to tell the truth, a truth that we can prove, not just a truth that we may personally believe in our gut. Because sharing the truth about what goes on at our nations colleges is the only way were going to get the changes made in policies and attitudes to protect both our young women and our young men."

Rees Shapiro December 5 at 9:44 PM  Follow @TReesShapiro     CHARLOTTESVILLE  A University of Virginia students harrowing description of a gang rape at a fraternity, detailed in a recent Rolling Stone article, began to unravel Friday as interviews revealed doubts about significant elements of the account. The fraternity issued a statement rebutting the story, and the magazine apologized for a lapse in judgment and backed away from the article. Jackie, a U-Va. junior, said she was ambushed and raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi house during a date party in 2012, allegations that tore through the campus and pushed the elite public school into the epicenter of a national discussion about how universities handle sex-assault claims. Shocking for its gruesome details, the account described Jackie enduring three hours of successive rapes, an ordeal that left her blood-spattered, scarred and emotionally devastated. The U-Va. fraternity where the attack was alleged to have occurred has said it has been working with police and has concluded that the allegations are untrue. Among other things, the fraternity said there was no event at the house the night the attack was alleged to have happened. A group of Jackies close friends, who are advocates at U-Va. for sex-assault awareness, said they believe that something traumatic happened to her, but they also have come to doubt her account. They said that details have changed over time and that they have not been able to verify key points in recent days. For example, an alleged attacker that Jackie identified to them for the first time this week  a junior in 2012 who worked with her as a university lifeguard  was actually the name of a student who belongs to a different fraternity, and no one by that name has been a member of Phi Kappa Psi.  (Related: U-Va. and sexual assault: The scrutiny will continue)      Rolling Stone has published a note to readers apologizing for an article about an alleged U-Va. sexual assault, saying new information shows discrepancies in the victim's story. (Reuters)   Reached by phone, that man, a U-Va. graduate, said Friday that he worked at the Aquatic and Fitness Center and was familiar with Jackies name. But he added that he never met Jackie in person and never took her out on a date. He also said he was not a member of Phi Kappa Psi. Jackie, who spoke to The Washington Post several times during the past week, stood by her account, offering a similar version and details. I never asked for this attention, she said in an interview. What bothers me is that so many people act like it didnt happen. Its my life. I have had to live with the fact that it happened, every day for the last two years. A lawyer who is representing Jackie said Friday that she and her client are declining to comment beyond her interviews. The Post generally does not identify victims of sexual assault without their permission, and The Post is identifying Jackie by her real nickname at her request. The prominent fraternity  which has been vilified, vandalized and ultimately suspended on campus since Sabrina Rubin Erdelys Rolling Stone article went online last month  said in its statement Friday that its initial doubts as to the accuracy of the article have only been strengthened as alumni and undergraduate members have delved deeper. Phi Kappa Psi said it did not host a date function or social event during the weekend of Sept. 28, 2012, when Jackie alleges that she was invited to a date party, lured into an upstairs room and then ambushed and gang-raped by seven men who were rushing the fraternity. The fraternity also said it has reviewed the roster of employees at the universitys Aquatic and Fitness Center for 2012 and found that it does not include a member of the fraternity  a detail Jackie provided in her account to Rolling Stone and in interviews with The Post  and that no member of the house matches the description detailed in the Rolling Stone account. The statement also said that the house does not have pledges during the fall semester.     The University of Virginia held a special meeting last week to discuss recent allegations of sexual assault that have rocked the campus. University President Teresa A. Sullivan said any systemic problems must be rooted out. (AP)   Moreover, no ritualized sexual assault is part of our pledging or initiating process, the fraternity said. This notion is vile, and we vehemently refute this claim. U-Va. President Teresa A. Sullivan said Friday that the developments will not alter the universitys focus on one of the most difficult and critical issues facing higher education today: sexual violence on college campuses. The University remains first and foremost concerned with the care and support of our students and, especially, any survivor of sexual assault, Sullivan said in a statement. Our students, their safety, and their well-being, remain our top priority. Sullivan vowed to continue taking a hard look at the schools practices, policies and procedures. Capt. Gary Pleasants of the Charlottesville police said detectives are looking into the allegations at the request of the university, but he would not comment on the status of that investigation. Our purpose is to find the truth in any matter, and thats what we are looking for here, Pleasants said. These articles do not change our focus moving forward. Rolling Stones editors apologized to readers for discrepancies in the story, issuing a statement and posting it on their Web site. Will Dana, Rolling Stones managing editor, said there is fresh doubt about the article. In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackies account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced, he said in the statement. The Post interviewed Jackie several times during the past week and has worked to corroborate her version of events, contacting dozens of current and former members of the fraternity, the fraternitys faculty adviser, Jackies friends and former roommates, and others on campus. Speaking for the first time since the details of her alleged sexual assault were published in Rolling Stone, the 20-year-old student told The Post that she is not wavering from her version of events. In lengthy in-person interviews, Jackie recounted an attack very similar to the one she presented in the magazine: She had gone on a date with a member of the house, went to a party there and ended up in a room where she was brutally attacked  seven men raping her in succession, with two others watching. Alex Pinkleton, a close friend of Jackies who survived a rape and an attempted rape during her first two years on campus, said in an interview that she has had numerous conversations with Jackie in recent days and now feels misled. One of my biggest fears with these inconsistencies emerging is that people will be unwilling to believe survivors in the future, Pinkleton said. However, we need to remember that the majority of survivors who come forward are telling the truth. Pinkleton said she is concerned that sexual assault awareness advocacy groups will suffer because of the conflicting details of the Rolling Stone allegations. While the details of this one case may have been misreported, this does not erase the somber truth this article brought to light: Rape is far more prevalent than we realize, and it is often misunderstood and mishandled by peers, institutions and society at large, Pinkleton said. We in the advocacy community at U-Va. will continue the work of making this issue accessible to our peers, guiding the conversation and our community into a place where sexual assaults are rare, where reporting processes are clear and adjudication is fair and compassionate. The fraternitys statement came two weeks after Rolling Stone ran a lengthy article about what it characterized as a culture of sex assault at the flagship state university, using Jackies story to illustrate how brazen such attacks can be and how indifferent the university is to them. The article, published in the Dec. 4 issue of the pop culture magazine, led to headlines around the world and rekindled college campuses discussions about sexual assault, sending U-Va.s administration scrambling to respond. The article spawned protests and vandalism, and the university quickly suspended all Greek system activities until the beginning of next semester and put out a call for zero tolerance of sex assault. The allegations also rippled through the Phi Kappa Psi community. A recent U-Va. graduate who now lives in the Washington area said he had lived in the fraternity house when the alleged attack occurred. He said he has been embarrassed to answer co-workers questions about which fraternity he belonged to during his days in Charlottesville, and he said it created doubts about some of those closest to him. It makes you second-guess yourselves, said the man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the fraternity asked that its members not speak publicly about the allegations. Maybe it could have happened and you dont know about it. But no one knew anything. We were talking amongst ourselves and wondering how could this have happened? We were all very, very confused. ... That we would require pledges to rape was outlandish. Thats essentially calling everyone who rushed the house a rapist, and that was just ridiculous. The Rolling Stone allegations shook the campus at a tumultuous moment, as the university was still mourning the death of U-Va. sophomore Hannah Graham. Her body was found five weeks after she disappeared in Charlottesville. Jackies story empowered many women to speak publicly about their own attacks, but it also immediately raised questions about the decisions Jackie made that evening  not going to a hospital or reporting the alleged crime to police or the school  while some expressed doubt about her story altogether. On Friday, Catherine Griesedieck and Michelle Hedrick, freshmen at U-Va., sat in a coffee shop adjacent to campus, saying they were shocked to learn that the story was coming under so much scrutiny and worried that it could make other rape survivors less likely to report attacks. Griesedieck said the news came on the last day of classes in what has been a difficult semester. Our community has been hurt so badly, Griesedieck said. We all take for granted that we go to a safe school, but you always have to be aware. Although Jackie shared elements of her story at a Take Back the Night event at the university, she told The Post that she had not intended for it to reach a wider audience until the Rolling Stone writer contacted her. If she had not come to me, I probably would not have gone public about my rape, said Jackie, adding that she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and is taking antidepressants. Earlier this week and for the first time, Jackie revealed to friends the full name of her alleged attacker, a name she had never disclosed to anyone. After looking into that persons background, the group that had been among her closest supporters quickly began to raise suspicions about her account. The friends determined that the student Jackie had named was not a member of Phi Kappa Psi and that other details about his background did not match information Jackie had disclosed earlier about her attacker. Emily Renda was a U-Va. senior when she met Jackie in the fall of 2013. In an interview, Renda said she immediately connected with Jackie as they discussed the bond they shared as rape survivors. Renda said she was raped her freshman year after attending a fraternity party. Jackie told The Post that she bawled as she spoke to Renda about her own sexual assault. Renda said Thursday that Jackie initially told her she was attacked by five students at Phi Kappa Psi. Renda said she learned months later that Jackie had changed the number of attackers from five to seven. An advocate is not supposed to be an investigator, a judge or an adjudicator, said Renda, a 2014 graduate who works for the university as a sexual violence awareness specialist. But as details emerge that cast doubt on Jackies account, Renda said, I dont even know what I believe at this point. This feels like a betrayal of good advocacy if this is not true, Renda said. We teach people to believe the victims. We know there are false reports, but those are extraordinarily low. Renda said research shows that between 2 and 8percent of rape allegations are fabricated or unfounded. The doubt cast on Jackies story has been feeding the myth that we have been combating for 40 years  that women lie about rape. And I feel that will put women at a disadvantage in coming forward, Renda said. In July, Renda introduced Jackie to Erdely, the Rolling Stone writer who was on assignment to write about sexual violence on college campuses. Overwhelmed by sitting through interviews with the writer, Jackie said she asked Erdely to be taken out of the article. She said Erdely refused, and Jackie was told that the article would go forward regardless. Jackie said she finally relented and agreed to participate on the condition that she be able to fact-check her parts in the story, which she said Erdely agreed to. I didnt want the world to read about the worst three hours of my life, the thing I have nightmares about every night, Jackie said. In an e-mail message, Erdely said she was not immediately available Friday, and she and Rolling Stone did not return phone calls and e-mails seeking comment.  In a series of tweets late Friday, Dana, Rolling Stones managing editor, said that he cant explain the discrepancies between Jackies account and the counter statements by Phi Psi and that the fact that there is a story that appears in Rolling Stone in which I dont have complete confidence is deeply unsettling to me. Dana tweeted that the reporters and editors at Rolling Stone made a judgment to come to an agreement with Jackie not to contact her alleged attackers, a judgment he wrote ended up being wrong. That failure is on us  not on her, he wrote. Jackie told The Post that she felt validated that the article encouraged other female students to come forward saying that they, too, had been sexually assaulted in fraternity houses. Havent enough people come forward at this point? she said. How many people do you need to come forward saying theyve been raped at a fraternity to make it real to you? They need to acknowledge its a problem. They need to address it instead of pointing fingers to take the blame off themselves. As classes resumed this week after Thanksgiving break, Jackie, whose family lives in Northern Virginia, returned to the campus where her story is still a daily topic of conversation. Although anonymous for now, she said she remains afraid that fellow students and fraternity members will somehow recognize her as the victim from the Rolling Stone article. Jackie said she never wanted to go to U-Va. Graduating near the top of her high school class of 700, she had planned to attend Brown University. She dreamed of pursuing a career in medicine, like her childhood hero, Patch Adams. I wanted to help people, Jackie said. She said she was disappointed when her family told her that they could not afford the Ivy League tuition. She enrolled at U-Va. without ever visiting the school. She said she performed well in course work that included rigorous pre-med classes in psychology, chemistry and religious anthropology. She said she soon found a job as a lifeguard at a campus pool, where she said she met a charming junior who had dimples, blue eyes and dark, curly hair. Jackie told The Post that the student later took her out for an extravagant dinner at the Boars Head before they attended a date function on Sept. 28, 2012, at his fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi. Jackie said her date appeared to have orchestrated the sexual assault by attempting to ply her with alcohol before escorting her into a darkened room on the second floor. Jackie said she did not actually drink alcohol that night because she was taking migraine medication. According to her account in Rolling Stone and in interviews, Jackie said she was thrown to a rug, breaking a low glass table in the process. She said she was cut on the back of her arm as a result but noted that her attack happened on a thick rug. Jackie told The Post that the men pinned her down and then raped her, the trauma leaving her bleeding from between her legs. One of them said Grab its [expletive] leg, she said, her lip quivering and tears streaming down her face. Its. Ill never forget that. I felt like nothing, like I wasnt even human. Jackie said she didnt go to a hospital or report the crime because she was new to campus and unaware of the resources available to her. She said the idea of recounting events to police terrified her. I didnt know what to do, she said. Jackies former roommate, Rachel Soltis, said she noticed emotional and physical changes to her friend during the fall semester of 2012, when they shared a suite. She was withdrawn, depressed and couldnt wake up in the mornings, said Soltis, who told The Post that she was convinced that Jackie was sexually assaulted. Soltis said that Jackie didnt tell her about the alleged sexual assault until January 2013. Soltis said she did not notice any apparent wounds on Jackies body at the time the assault allegedly occurred. The Post asked Jackie numerous times to reveal the full name of the two attackers she said she recognized. She declined, saying she didnt want the perpetrator to come back in my life. Jackie said numerous times that she did not expect that a police investigation would lead to any charges. She said she knew there was little, if any, forensic evidence that could prove the allegations two years afterward. I didnt want a trial, Jackie said. I cant imagine getting up on a defense stand having them tear me apart. Jackie said early in the week that she felt manipulated by the Rolling Stone reporter, adding that she felt completely out of control over my own story. In an in-person interview Thursday, Jackie said the Rolling Stone account of her attack was truthful, but she also acknowledged that some details in the article might not be accurate. Jackie contradicted an earlier interview, saying Thursday that she did not know whether her main attacker actually was a member of Phi Kappa Psi. He never said he was in Phi Psi, she said, while noting that she was positive that the date function and attack occurred at the fraternity house. I know it was Phi Psi, because a year afterward, my friend pointed out the building to me and said thats where it happened.

But that's exactly what happened Friday, when Texas Gov.-elect Greg Abbott came to the White House. Abbott, currently the state's attorney general, led a lawsuit filed againstObama this week that challenges his executive action on immigration. Sixteen other states have signed on to the suit.It's the 31st lawsuit Abbott has filed against the Obama administration. The president invited the nation's new governors-elect to the White House for a meeting. Abbott and six others attended. ""They represent a wide variety of states but they all have a common interest, and that is making sure that their constituents -- who are also my constituents -- are able to gain opportunity, work hard, prosper, feel secure. And that happens best when we work together,"" Obama said. Lawsuits and nice words aside, things may have been a bit awkward between Abbott, who railed against Obama during his campaign, and the president. And it's no secret that Abbott has little love for Washington.

The Washington Post,L,Historic White House shovel stole the spotlight of Kennedy Center ceremony - The Washington Post," By Peggy McGlone December 5 at 4:22 PM  Follow https://twitter.com/PeggyMcGlone      White House staffers Donna Hayashi Smith and William Allman unwrap a ceremonial shovel used by President Lyndon B. Johnson at the groundbreaking for the original Kennedy Center in 1964. (Photo by Bill OLeary/The Washington Post)  There were so many oohs and ahhs, you would have thought it was a baby that Kennedy Center Chairman David Rubenstein was showing off to thecrowd. But it was a shovel  a spade, really  thoughan old and historical one. And right afterthe garden toolsbig reveal,its business end was shoved into a patch of black dirt as cameras flashed and cheers erupted. It was a little hard for us to watch, White House Curator William Allman said about that moment, the highlight of thegroundbreaking ceremony Thursdaythat launched the arts centersfirst major expansion. The eventcame 50 years to the week that President Lyndon B. Johnson  using the same spade  broke ground for the original facility, a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy. That ceremony, on Dec. 2, 1964, was the last time the spade was in the spotlight. But it wasnt the first. Allman said the tool had been used at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Lincoln Memorial on Feb. 12, 1914  though contrary to legend it wasnt handled by President William Howard Taft because the president wasnt at the ceremony. That event and most of the others  the groundbreaking of the amphitheater at Arlington Cemetery on March 1, 1915, and the memorial to Gen. George Meade on March 28, 1922  are memorialized in plaques on the spades handle. Oddly, the groundbreaking of the Jefferson Memorial on Dec. 15, 1938 isnt commemorated on the handle, though Allman said it is featured in photographs of the event. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, seated in a car, is either giving the tool to a park service officer, or taking it from him, hesaid. What you can see in the pictures is some of the labels, a part of one, a whole of one. I dont think theres any question its the same shovel, he said. Allman knows a lot of its history, but he doesnt know the whole story of what he described as a special item of the collection. We cant tell exactly how we got the shovel, it was probably inherited by the White House horticulturist, he said. Usually it lives in storage off-site. Kennedy Center officials ask to borrow the spade for the groundbreaking of its $100 million project. Designed by Steven Holl, the expansion will add 60,000 square feet of rehearsal, classroom and performance space. It is projected to open on May 29, 2017, the 100th anniversary of JFKs birth. Allman and his colleague Donna Hayashi Smith had swaddled it in blankets and carried itto thearts center for the morning ceremony. Afterward, they took it back to the White House andcarefully wiped the dirt from its flat blade. Like many of the items in theWhite House, the tool is used from time to time. The White House is a little different from other museums. We let people sit on the furniture, walk on the rugs. We have to accept that, he said. The spadeis ready to go back into its container and return to storage, Allman said, although he wasnt sure if it will return with a new plaque commemorating its latest star turn. We havent talked about that, he said."
The Washington Post,L,Vincent Gray  D.C.s unfinished business - The Washington Post,"   Former D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray. (Sarah L. Voisin/THE WASHINGTON POST)   By Colbert I. King  December 5 at 7:41 PM   The time is drawing near to start a new chapter in the District. The next phase will begin without Marion Barry, set to be laid to rest Saturday. The transition from old to new, however, is already underway with Muriel Bowsers passage from D.C. Council member to mayor-elect, the election of council members Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) and Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), and more new faces waiting to emerge from the April special election for council vacancies in Wards 4 and 8. Unfortunately, the city has some major unfinished business, too. Mayor Vincent C. Grays story is not complete. As long as that page remains unturned, any effort to advance to the next stage of city life could be turbulent. Gray (D) and U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. hold the power to decide whether the District experiences a smooth or rocky transition. Both men, admittedly, have interests of their own to consider.  Several weeks ago, Gray let it be known where he stood when he rejected a plea offer from Machens prosecutors. The government reportedly proposed that Gray plead guilty to an unidentified felony count in connection with the 2010 mayoral campaign. Gray stoutly maintains his innocence, and he values his reputation. He says he wont cut a deal. He shouldnt if hes clean. Gray may have weighed the strength of Machens case and concluded that the prosecutor has a weak hand. Machen, in turn, has to consider the uncertainties of trying a case against a mayor who, while not wildly popular, is credited with having done a reasonably good job. What is the likelihood of Machen getting a conviction at a trial, especially if his case depends upon the credibility of businessman and admitted felon Jeffrey E. Thompson, who was given a highly favorable plea deal, presumably for giving up Gray? If Machen is also relying on defeated 2010 mayoral candidates Leo Alexander and Sulaimon Brown, he will have to weigh how much those two men would help him with a jury. Alexander, for instance, told The Post in April 2013 that, before the September 2010 Democratic primary, Gray urged him to drop out of the race and to speak with political consultant Jeanne Clarke Harris; she pleaded guilty in 2012 to her role in a large-scale scheme to evade campaign finance rules in the 2010 race. Gray said he did talk to Alexander about getting out of the race, but nothing more. Alexander told The Post that he did not ask for, and was not offered, money to drop out. If nothing happened, what could Machen have from Alexander that could be used against Gray in court? Likewise with Sulaimon Brown, who has said he was paid and promised a city job by Grays campaign if he kept running and verbally attacking then-Mayor Adrian Fenty. Two Gray campaign aides, Thomas W. Gore and Howard L. Brooks, pleaded guilty to actions related to that payoff scheme. Brown said that Gray knew of the payoffs, but Gray denies any wrongdoing. Brown will have to do a much better job before a jury than he did as a witness at the D.C. Councils hearing on his allegations. There, wearing dark glasses he would not remove, he came across as self-absorbed and vindictive. Advice to Machen: Hire a coach for Brown  and pray. Does the governments case against Gray rest on Brown, Alexander, Thompson or any witnesses who have negotiated plea deals?  Having sought  and thus far failed  to dispose of the case against Gray by means of a plea agreement, Machen is at the point of a decision. By proposing a deal, Machen has signaled that the government believes the legal standards for Grays guilt have been met and that it has serious and readily provable charges to present to a grand jury. That should be a prerequisite to a government plea proposal. Now its time to put up or shut up, to charge and go to trial, to prove the governments case against Gray before a jury of Grays peers. After four years of innuendo, speculation and leaks, it is critical that there be a clear understanding that justice is being done in the city.  Grays reputation and future are at stake. Machen, having climbed that tree and gone out on a limb, may now be hearing the sound of wood-cutting saws being sharpened. So the government has got to get going. Confidence in the criminal justice system is at stake. Machen needs to take care of the unfinished business, so that the city can get on to the next chapter in its long unfolding saga.

The Washington Post,L,"In budget talks, District autonomy remains under fire - The Washington Post","   A worker (L) reaches for supplies while working atop the scaffolded dome of the U.S. Capitol in Washington December 4, 2014. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)   By Editorial Board December 5 at 7:35 PM   JUST AS city officials feared, the Districts local laws have become bargaining chips as Congress and the White House try to avert a federal government shutdown. House Republicans are pushing to block an initiative recently approved by D.C. voters to legalize marijuana, and it is far from clear that Democrats in the Senate and White House will stand firm for the Districts right to self-determination. Sen.Harry Reid (D-Nev.) should not make one of his last acts as majority leader squashing the home rule of 600,000 U.S. citizens. With negotiations coming down to the wire over an omnibus spending bill, the National Journal reported that efforts are underway by the House GOP to attach a rider that would ban the District from using local funds to implement a measure making it legal to possess or grow small amounts of marijuana. Also at risk are the citys decriminalization of marijuana and the citys gun laws, including the ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. Its pretty much a foregone conclusion that the ban that has been imposed on the expenditure of local funds for abortions for low-income women will continue.  We did not favor the legalization of marijuana, but D.C. residents voted with nearly 70percent approval to join four states that have legalized small amounts of the drug. That should be the end of the matter. One would think Republicans, members of a party that rails against government overreach and federal interference in local affairs, would agree. Moreover, if Republicans are serious about wanting to reach out to minority communities, they should be more mindful of and sympathetic to the Districts efforts to reduce racial disparities in the enforcement of its marijuana laws. Recent studies show that African Americans, who make up slightly less than half the District population and use marijuana at the same rate as whites, are eight times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than non-blacks. Make no mistake, though. If the Districts autonomy ends up being the price of an agreement to keep the government open  which happened in 2011 when President Obama bargained away the Districts ability to help low-income women  the fault will also fall squarely on the shoulders of the Democrats; they still control the Senate and the White House, and they will have leverage in the House, too, because their votes will likely be needed to pass a spending package. Democrats need to make clear that the principle at stake here  the right to self-determination  will not be bargained away.

The Washington Post,L,"For Americans exonerated in Qatar, the law worked. Eventually. - The Washington Post"," By Cameron Barr December 5 at 3:35 PM  Follow @cameronbarr      In this photo posted on the Twitter account of the David House Agency, Matthew Huang, top right, and his wife, Grace, left, greet loved ones upon their arrival in the United States, presumably in Los Angeles, on Thursday. (AP Photo/David House Agency)  Grace and Matthew Huang are back homein the United States after a nearly two-year legal battle with authorities in Qatar, a happyend toanarrative that sometimesfollows a predictable script: Americans are incarcerated abroad; agitation generates high-level political intervention; charges disappear as the U.S. citizens are allowed to leave.      An American couple held on charges in their adopted daughter's death left Qatar on Wednesday, after a court ruling absolved them of any wrongdoing. (AP)   The Huangss case, prompted by suspicionsarising fromthe death of their 8-year-old daughter last year, contained some of these elements but turned more on the withering of the legal case against them, which ended with an appellate judge excoriating the prosecution. In his ruling on Sunday, appellate Judge Abdul Rahman al-Sharafi painstakingly criticized the work of the prosecution, in what the New York Times described as a highly unusual development in the Qatari judicial system, where prosecutors and the police are often heavily favored. The defense offered plenty of proof that they are not guilty, the judge said, according to the Times. U.S. officials familiar with the case said Friday that there was a lot of work done behind the scenes to ensure the judges understood the evidence, a tactic the officialsemphasized over applying high-level political pressure to win the Huangs freedom. The judge said it better than I ever could, said one U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of lingering diplomatic sensitivities. Its been horrible for the Huangs, but its sort of a success storythat the Qatari legal system functioned as any good legal system should. We just wish it could have happened more quickly. The Huangs moved to Qatar from California in 2012 with their three children so that Matthew, an engineer, could oversee an infrastructure project related to the countrys plan to host the 2022 World Cup. Their daughter Gloria, adopted from Ghana after a traumatic early childhood, died suddenly last January, drawing concern from Qatari officials who suspected the child had been mistreated. The Huangs were arrested and their two other children placed in an orphanage, based on an initial, ultimately discredited theory that Gloria had been starved to death as part of a plan to harvest her organs or conduct medical experiments. The Huangs were convicted on a lesser negligence charge and sentenced to three years in prison. The couple spent nearly a year in prison before being released on appeal; their sons were released from the orphanage and sent home to family in the United States. The couple was represented by the David House Agency, a crisis management firm, and supported by the California Innocence Project, a legal services nonprofit that works to free people who are wrongfully convicted. Heres how CIP describes what afflicted Gloria: Prior to her adoption by the Huangs, Gloria was born into extreme poverty in Ghana and was not adopted until she was four years old. When she arrived in the United States she had Giardia, a parasitic condition that can be difficult to eradicate and can cause a nutritional problem  i.e., impair the bodys ability to absorb nutrients from food. She later tested positive for Vitamin D deficiency and had other unusual blood work that, in retrospect, indicated a continuing malabsorption problem. From time to time she would exhibit an eating disorder  common among children with backgrounds similar to hers  where she would refuse food for days at a time and then eat more than an adult. Other times she would eat food from the garbage even when she had healthy food available. Yet most of the time she was vibrant and seemingly healthy. Although it is still not known what caused Glorias death, the medical and other evidence shows that Gloria clearly did not die of starvation. Media accounts of the Huangs situation note the cultural complexities raised by international adoption and expatriate living. Officials in Qatar, which doesnt allow adoption, suspected the couple of engaging in human trafficking.I believe that authorities in Qatar suspected foul play because we are Asian and we adopted three children from Africa who are black, Matthew Huang told Yahoo Newss Katie Couric. Qatar has been a U.S. partner on issues including the conflict against the Islamic State and helping to brokerthe release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity, andAmerican diplomats joined the effort to resolve the case. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry weighedin during a tense endgame, when the Huangs encountered difficulties leaving the country even after their acquittal and were left in limbo for several days. Kerry called Qatari Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohammed al-Attiyah to press for the couples speedy return to the United States.The Qatari embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Shell Smith accompanied the couple to the airport in Doha, the Qatari capital, and made sure they got on the plane. She tweeted:   Matt and Grace Huang are wheels up from Qatar. Emotional. These are the moments all diplomats live for. #proud to serve  Dana Shell Smith (@AmbDana) December 3, 2014  After they reached California on Thursday, Eric Volz, managing director of the David House Agency, sent word to the familys supporters.

The Washington Post,L,Painting Ted Turners legacy - The Washington Post," By Lillian Cunningham December 4  Follow @lily_cunningham      Ted Turner looks at his portrait, unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington on Tuesday. (Photo by Lillian Cunningham/The Washington Post)  If the portrait of Ted Turner unveiled this weekat the National Portrait Gallery is any indication, the businessman doesnt want to be remembered foremost as the founder of CNN and the crafter of a cable news empire. Heis painted on horseback amid the bison and foothill grasslands of his ranch in southwest Montana. The electric-colored backdrop gives no nod totheindustry he upended on the East Coastthatmade his name and his riches. It's instead an homage to his later move Westward, sweeping up huge swaths of American range. Commemorative portraiture like this is an odd thing: The artwork stands in the nations gallery as a giantimageof yourself, hardened in brightly saturated oils, on display to a crowd of colleagues and cameras. The rugged backdrop for the portrait was Turner's directive, and itscommissioning was a deliberate effort to shape what, for posterity, the American public most remembers about him. Turner's family, along with the UN Foundation, to which Turnerdonated $1 billion, hatchedtheidea to get a painting of him into the National Portrait Gallery. Heselected the artist Jon Friedman, whose similarly bold oil-on-canvasof Bill and Melinda Gates already hangs there. In that one,a monitor displayingimages from the Gates Foundation hints at both the technology and philanthropy that has defined Bill Gates's career. Turner choseFriedmanin part for his portfolio of big-name portraiture and because several of his previous paintings had appeasedthe museum's board of commissioners, which decides whether gifted portraits willbe accepted into the collection. Since merging Turner Broadcasting System with Time Warner nearly 20 years ago, Turnerhas focused much of his energy and wealth on the environment, global health and security,and his more than 2 million acres of land. At76, he is now the second-largest private landowner in the United States. The last installment of his $1 billion donationto the UN was made this year. Yet to many, he is still known less as a philanthropist than as the godfather of CNN. According to Brandon Fortune, chief curator at the National Portrait Gallery, itis rare for a paintings subject to orchestrate a gift this way and to be present at the museums unveiling. ForTurner, and those close to him,it is an opportunity to actively sketch the contours of his legacy as the years count up. The painting is a six-by-four-and-a-half-foot vision of what hewants that to be: an iconin the tradition of philanthropist-tycoons like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. The man and his country, an American classic, says Kathy Calvin, president and chief executiveof the UN Foundation. The great American humanitarian, says Rutherford Seydel, Turner's son-in-law and general counsel. The image being crafted, both visually and metaphorically, strategically echoesthecover and title of the cable mogul's recent authorized biography, ""Last Stand: Ted Turner's Quest to Save a Troubled Planet."" That, too, shows Turner, wearing a cowboy hat and leading a horse, against a similar backdrop of green meadows, snowcapped mountains and cerulean sky. Given that new technologies like streaming threaten to overtakethe once-revolutionary cable model that Turner made big, he may be wise to use his later years shaping a different association. He no longer holds a position with Turner Broadcasting System, and lost roughly $8 billion when the stock plummeted after a subsequent merger with AOL, though he is still among the wealthiest living Americans. If Turner's portrait is a window into how he wants to be remembered, it's perhaps also a window into thewishes and fears that occupymany of us as weget older. The difference, of course, is that far fewer of us can commission the imagethat's catalogued. Read also: Richard Branson, Virgin's stunt man"

The Washington Post,L,Elite fragmentation and securitization in Bahrain - The Washington Post," By Toby Matthiesen December 5 at 12:51 PM     Riot police line up to block protesters from making it to a main highway after hundreds of Bahrainis headed to the streets for a flash march in support of an opposition-called boycott of Saturdays parliamentary and municipal elections in Diraz, Bahrain, on Nov. 21. (Hasan Jamali/AP)  In February 2011, Bahrain probably had the highest ratio of protesters as part of the citizen population of any of the Arab countries. In the preceding decade, its security establishment, while never totally absent from politics, had become less visible. In mid-March 2011, however, the security forces were able to instigate a broad clampdown against the mobilized public and ensure the survival of the regime within a matter of days. How can this be explained? And what are the enduring consequences of the resurgence of Bahrains security state? The general phenomenon of popular challenge and regime crackdown in Bahrain is not new, of course. Bahrain has experienced mass movements for democratic reform throughout much of its modern history. In most cases, harsh repression and the awarding of extraordinary powers to the security forces effectively ended those cycles of protest. In 1956, the leaders of a cross-sectarian reform movement, the High Executive Committee, were arrested and exiled, and many others were imprisoned at home. In 1965, a broad-based workers uprising that paralyzed key parts of the economy was suppressed. Thereafter, the British government installed Ian Henderson, a colonial police officer who had participated in the suppression of the Mau-Mau rebellion in Kenya in the 1950s, as head of security in Bahrain. He would oversee the creation of a special investigations unit to track domestic opponents. This unit was also key in protecting the regime after the ruler Sheikh Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa aborted the parliamentary experiment from 1973-75 and abolished parliament. Until the late 1970s, the main opposition to the al-Khalifa had come from revolutionary Arab nationalists and communists, and to a certain extent both groups had a cross-sectarian and cross-ethnic base, ensuring that most groups of citizens would be subject to surveillance. But in the late 1970s and in the 1980s, when Shiite Islamists started to become the most powerful political opposition force on the island, security forces started to disproportionately target and police Shiite villages and urban quarters. This intensified during the intifada from 1994-99. But, intriguingly, this was the only period of major political mobilization on the island that was not stopped through a widespread security clampdown and the declaration of martial law. Instead, the accession of King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa to the throne led to a general amnesty for political prisoners and exiles, and limited political reforms. In the 2000s, the security services took on a reduced and less visible role. Torture, which was common practice before 1999, largely ceased to be used as a punitive measure against political detainees. The regimes answer to the 2011 uprising again brought to the fore the role of the security forces, and the security-minded members of the ruling family. In February 17, 2011, it seemed as if the security forces had retreated and left the Bahraini street to the protesters. Less than a month later, a state of emergency was declared, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) troops mainly from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates moved in, and security forces started the perhaps largest crackdown in the history of the island. While the Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa was trying to reach a negotiated agreement with the opposition, other members of the al-Khalifa family, and the security apparatuses, were preparing for the security-solution to the mass protests. As in 1956, 1965 and 1975, the crackdown landed many dissidents and those suspected of being political activists in jail, drove many into exile and radicalized a new generation of activists, some of whom started to advocate the use of violence as a revolutionary tool. The intensity of this crackdown is explained in part by factional politics within the ruling family. The faction that has its power base in the various security institutions felt deeply threatened by the protest movement. The security minded-factions of al-Khalifa are centered on Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, as well as in a branch of al-Khalifa known as the Khawalids. The Khawalids stem from a different branch of the al-Khalifa family than the king and the crown prince  they are descendants of Khalid bin Ali al-Khalifa and feel disenfranchised in the succession to the throne. They were sidelined by the British but have regained increasing importance over the past decade, and they now hold key positions: Royal Court Minister Khalid bin Ahmad al-Khalifa; Commander of the Bahrain Defense Forces, Khalifa bin Ahmad al-Khalifa; and Minister of Justice Khalid bin Ali al-Khalifa are all Khawalids. Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman, who has been in his position since 1970, was a focal point of protesters, who were calling for his resignation. So while the king and his son, the crown prince, could have expected to survive in their positions and even potentially be strengthened through a political settlement, the prime minister and the Khawalids would have been weakened, and might have lost their positions. So the security solution, which they subsequently imposed on Bahrain, and which led to the dismissal and imprisonment of thousands of people, the deaths of dozens, and the exile of many others, was in some ways a result of elite fragmentation. Still, Bahrain could not have gone down the securitization route without the strong support of external backers, which for decades have strengthened the security apparatus and provided political cover for rights abuses and authoritarian rule. Despite their large numbers, the protesters could not withstand the crackdown by the security forces militarily. Even though the regime claims the contrary, the vast majority if not all protesters were unarmed. The geography of the small island with no natural hideouts does not lend itself to armed struggle. In addition, the sheer number of the security forces would have been overwhelming (and thousands more have been recruited since 2011). Because they are largely made up of foreigners or naturalized officers, who feel little sympathy with the uprising, there was little danger that they would defect or resist orders. In addition, the arrival of GCC military units and most likely Jordanian Special Forces tinted the military balance even further in the regimes favor. Finally, the regime increased the sectarian rhetoric and reinforced sectarian divisions that managed to split the islands population more or less according to sectarian lines. This ensured that while the majority of the population felt alienated by the crackdown, a significant number of (mainly Sunni) citizens supported or at least tacitly accepted it. Crucially, the international condemnation of the crackdown also remained limited. Political cover by GCC and other Arab and Sunni allies (such as Jordan and Pakistan), as well as important business partners of the GCC in the West, and in particular the old colonial power Britain, ensured that sanctions or any other severe consequences in the international arena did not materialize. Bahrain was also helped by the sheer number of world-historical events unfolding in a short span of time, and attention quickly shifted elsewhere in March 2011, particularly to Libya, where the uprising against Moammar Gaddafi gained pace. Indeed, in her memoir, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledges that the UAE had threatened to pull out of the coalition against Gaddafi if the United States had taken a harsher stance toward the Bahraini regime. The security forces have since 2011 also been used to further entrench preexisting divisions between urban and recently urbanized and rural areas, and between broadly pro-uprising and pro-regime areas. The heavy policing of pro-uprising neighborhoods and villages, the checkpoints at the entrances to these areas, and the at times total lockdown of such areas for days or weeks and the extensive use of tear gas as a form of collective punishment have become key features of life on the island. These practices are the result of transformations in Bahrains urban geography over the past decades, which have seen the massive reclamation of land from the sea and a radical transformation of the built-up areas fueled by, and fueling, real estate speculation. These developments had negative byproducts for villages that were formerly by the sea and for the quality of life in many other areas (groundwater levels, pollution, etc.). In essence, this spatial-demographic revolution, as it has been termed, has been a key driver of the uprising, and the security forces have since 2011 been used to strengthen the spatial divisions that Bahrains urban planning attempted to achieve in the first place. Since mid-March 2011 then, the protests have been confined to the villages and outlying suburbs of Manama, while the urban centers of Manama and Muharraq, and the business district, have been policed so heavily that protesters refrain from going there, except for brief flash-mob-like protests that are quickly dispersed. The occupation of Pearl Roundabout, which was a briefly successful attempt to reclaim public space in a country dominated by private and commercial property developers, ended with the destruction of the Pearl Monument and the creation of a (heavily guarded) traffic intersection. So the crackdown and the ensuing heavy policing have further entrenched divisions on the island, and driven the protests out into the periphery. There, however, they continue on a daily basis and with no political solution in sight seem likely to continue for the foreseeable future. A dialogue process that included parts of the opposition has stalled, arguably because the ruling family was not prepared to make significant concessions. Elections for municipal councils and the lower house of the bicameral parliament were boycotted by the opposition, and as a consequence highlighted the political polarization of the island. The securitization of Bahrain seems difficult to reverse, particularly because it has shifted the power in intra-ruling family struggles more toward the security-minded branches of the family. Shiites are being marginalized even more in key state institutions, while naturalization of Sunnis is ongoing. So the Shiites, who had been one of the constituencies that King Hamad and the crown prince had wooed in the past decade, are becoming less and less important as potential bases of support in intra-regime power struggles. In essence, the security sector has learned to live, and indeed thrive, off the constant demonstrations and the on-going uprising. And so the impetus for a political solution to the grievances that fueled the uprising in the first place is becoming less and less strong, particularly while international pressure on the regime is limited. Toby Matthiesen is a research fellow in Islamic and Middle Eastern studies at Pembroke College, University of Cambridge.He is the author of The Other Saudis: Shiism, Dissent and Sectarianism, which outlines the history of political movements among the Shiites of Saudi Arabia and their relationship with the Saudi state. It will be published by Cambridge University Press in January."
The Washington Post,L,Rolling Stone needs to come clean about its campus rape story - The Washington Post," By Alyssa Rosenberg December 5 at 2:23 PM  Follow @AlyssaRosenberg   After days of questions, Rolling Stone has finally answered the two big questions asked of its blockbuster story about sexual assault at the University of Virginia: DidreporterSabrina Rubin Erdely try to contact the students who were accused of gang-raping Jackie, a student whose shocking storyanchoredthe piece? And if not,whynot?    Protestors carry signs and chant slogans in front of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia late Saturday night, Nov. 22, 2014, in Charlottesville, Va. (AP Photo/The Daily Progress, Ryan M. Kelly)  In a statement that clarifies the conflicting accounts Erdely and her editor have given to numerous publications, editor Will Dana explains that: Because of the sensitive nature of Jackies story, we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed orchestrated the attack on her nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her. In the months Erdely spent reporting the story, Jackie neither said nor did anything that made Erdely, or Rolling Stones editors and fact-checkers, question Jackies credibility. Her friends and rape activists on campus strongly supported Jackies account. She had spoken of the assault in campus forums. We reached out to both the local branch and the national leadership of the fraternity where Jackie said she was attacked. They responded that they couldnt confirm or deny her story but had concerns about the evidence. Dana also explains that, In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackies account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced. Washington Post reporters also published a storythat attempted to verify Erdelys reporting, and to contact the man Jackie identified as her date on the night she said she was assaulted. Among other details, The Post reports: Overwhelmed from sitting through interviews with the writer, Jackie said she asked Erdely to be taken out of the article. She said Erdely refused and Jackie was told that the article would go forward regardless. Jackie said she finally relented and agreed to participate on the condition that she be able to fact-check her parts in the story, which she said Erdely accepted. Erdely said in an e-mail message that she was not immediately available to comment Friday morning. This catastrophe for journalism  and for a conversation about sexual assault on college campuses that remains of critical importance  is in part of Rolling Stones own making. I would not have made the agreement with Jackie that Erdely and her editors struck. But having done so, Rolling Stone ought to have been clear about their agreement with Jackie in the initial article, and explained in a clear and forthright way the efforts they made to speak with the fraternity.These details might have affected how credible some readers found Jackies account, but they would also have added context to her fears of retaliation and her sense of the campus climate.      Rolling Stone has published a note to readers apologizing for an article about an alleged U-Va. sexual assault, saying new information shows discrepancies in the victim's story. (Reuters)   Rolling Stone interviewed Emily Renda, another University of Virginia student who says she is a survivor of sexual assault, who is active in campus anti-rape advocacy, and who was also a target of the same retaliation that Jackie experienced. Erdely also spoke with Stacy, another student who reported being abused and successfully pursued a misconduct complaint through the UVA disciplinary process. So why didErdely and Rolling Stone chooseJackie as the main character in A Rape on Campus, even though they had to agree not to contact the men she was accusing, and especially after she tried to withdraw her participation? Was it that Jackies story was not simply an account of sexual assault, but a gang-rape, an attention-grabbing atrocity that seemed like it might generate more heat on the issue? Was it an opportunity to indict the institutional culture of fraternities by describing an assault that did not merely happen at a Phi Kappa Psi party, but that was presented as part of an initiation ritual?Whatever the choices Rolling Stone made in reporting and editing A Rape on Campus, the magazinewould do itself and the effort to end sexual assault on campus a favor by publishing a full autopsy of its choices.

The Washington Post,L,Tamir Rices family files wrongful death lawsuit after fatal shooting of 12-year-old in Cleveland - The Washington Post," By Sarah Larimer December 5 at 4:24 PM  Follow @slarimer      Demonstrators block Public Square on Nov. 25, 2014, in Cleveland, during a protest over the weekend police shooting of Tamir Rice. The 12-year-old was fatally shot by a Cleveland police officer Saturday after he reportedly pulled a replica gun at the city park. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak)  The estate of a 12-year-old boy who was fatally shot while carrying a toy gun in Cleveland has filed a lawsuit against the police officers who were involved in the incident, as well as the city, court documents show. The eight-page complaint, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, claims that Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback used excessive and unnecessary force against Tamir Rice, and caused his wrongful death. Tamir was shot on Nov. 22at a local park in Cleveland, whenLoehmann andGarmback responded to a 911 call about a person pointing a gun. The caller noted that the firearm was probably fake, but that message wasnt passed on to police, and the guns orange safety cap was missing. Loehmann shot Tamir in the stomach, and the boy died early the next day. He lay on the ground without medical treatment for at least four minutes after the shooting, the lawsuit claims. As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of Defendants City of Cleveland, Loehmann, and Garmback, Tamir Rice suffered terror and fear as Defendants Loehmann and Garmback approached him with their cruiser and their guns, the court filing reads. Tamir Rice also suffered physical injury, pain, torture, emotional and psychological trauma, and eventually died as a result of the use of force and failure to provide adequate medical care described above.      Editor's note: This video contains graphic content. The family of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by police while carrying a BB gun in a Cleveland park, authorized the release of surveillance footage showing the incident. (Cleveland Police)    Surveillance footage released last month shows the 26-year-old Loehmann, a rookie officer who struggled at another department earlier in his law enforcement career, jumping out of a cruiser and shooting Rice within seconds of arriving on the scene. Young boys playing with replica guns are commonplace in America and police are expected to approach them safely if an investigation is warranted, the complaint reads, not shoot them dead within two seconds. The lawsuit lists Elizabeth Goodwin, administrator for the estate, as the plaintiff. Attorneys listed on the court filings did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. A spokesman for the city of Cleveland also did not immediately respond to a telephone message and an e-mail. Tamir "
The Washington Post,L,Ubers not a $40 billion start-up. Its a mid-sized car company. - The Washington Post," By Nancy Scola December 5 at 4:55 PM  Follow @nancyscola      Uber delivered flu prevention kits and vaccines on demand throughout Chicago on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2014. (Jean-Marc Giboux/AP Images for Uber)  As it puts together its latest round of fundraising, Uber has been valued at $40 billion. Many have found that figure eye-popping for a six-year-old ride-on-demand company. But at least some transportation scholars say that that figure isn't so crazy. To understand why, it helps to think of Uber's competition in the market not as taxi companies, nor even other alternative transportation options like Lyft or Zipcar. Instead, says Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, Uber's value is based on the bet that it will soon ""become a meaningful substitute for people owning cars."" Uber launched in 2009 in San Francisco as a high-end car service. It existed to serve those who wanted, in the words of chief executive Travis Kalanick, a ""baller"" way of getting around the city. But somewhat by coincidence, that luxury service also happened to be a perfect match for how masses of people wanted to travel. Young people in the United States aren't driving nearly as much as they once did. That has put Uber in a position to suck up some of the billions of dollars that people might otherwise pour into cars, gas and auto insurance.  ""Uber's strength is that it has tapped the mobility needs of a young generation of a networked people at exactly the moment their demands are changing,"" says Anthony Townsend, senior research scientist at NYU's Rudin Center for Transportation. In part, Townsend says, that has to do with the rapid rise of powerful, Internet-connected mobile phones. According to the Pew Research Internet Project, about 80 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 own a smartphone, and ""they don't want to drive because they want to stare at their screens."" Add in that more young people in the United States are moving into cities, where Uber's distance-dependent pricing is less painful than it would be in the suburbs. As long as Uber keeps its customer service high and prices within reason, people will find it just as economical and perhaps more enjoyable to use Uber to get around than owning a car. With that in mind, considering Uber to be worth a mid-sized car company doesn't seem so far-fetched. But there's more. Uber today isn't just about getting yourself a ride. It's about getting your stuff a ride to you. In some of the 51 countries around the globe where it operates, Uber is aggressively experimenting with flipping the equation so that cars and drivers are delivering everything from packages to flu shots to kitten snuggles. ""Thinking of them as a company that transports people from one place to another is one part of the story,"" says Sundararajan, pausing our phone call to get into an arriving Uber vehicle. ""But you wouldn't come up with a $40 billion valuation from just that. Their investors are betting on a behavioral change amount where a lot of people are willing to spend more than they do now to get things on demand."" And when you can not only get where you need to go but also get what you need from the world without owning a car, the value of automobile ownership drops dramatically. That said, cautions Townsend, Uber's success for the next few years at least is premised on a non-car-owning millennial user base making the service a trusted part of their everyday lives. ""And they've done everything they can to tick that generation off,"" he says, pointing to recent comments by an Uber executive about the company's willingness to expose user data and to investigate journalists who've written critically about the company. ""That 'baller' attitude that Uber hastaken means the brand doesn't seem to be maturing to match its user base,"" says Townsend. ""Alienating all of the women in North America is not a smart move."" And once the world's major car companies feel threatened enough by Uber's success, argues Townsend, ""they're going to get into the game, too."" There are already signs of that happening. BMW, for example, has launched i Ventures, a venture-capital wing inspired by the idea that ""the emerging field of mobility services is in a continuous state of evolution."" That branch of BMW has already put money into a location-aware city services app, the online parking marketplace ParkatmyHouse.com and a New York City transportation start-up incubator. Uber may well have enough money on hand to compete with a forward-looking BMW, which is valued at about $73 billion after nearly a hundred years in business. But competing with the entire, energized automotive industry might prove a considerably bigger challenge. "

The Washington Post,L,Challenging the justice system - The Washington Post,"    (Jeff Roberson/AP)     By Ruth Marcus Columnist December 5 at 7:43 PM  Follow @RuthMarcus     The decisions by two grand juries not to indict police officers in the deaths of black men mark an opportune moment  both depressing and uplifting  to write about civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson.  Stevensons story, told in a new memoir, Just Mercy, will not make you feel better about the ugly, persistent role of race in the criminal justice system. Rather, it will ratify the omnipresence of racial bias  from the happenstance of a police stop through the labyrinth of the court system to the horror of death row.   Ruth Marcus is a columnist and editorial writer for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive   Facebook RSS   I happen to believe that the grand jury decision to decline an indictment of Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson was probably the correct call; the failure to indict the New York City police officer in the choking death of Eric Garner is appalling. But race suffuses both cases. That both police officers were white and both dead men were African American is a telling, essential part of the story, not a terrible coincidence.  One searing incident in Stevensons book underlines this inescapable truth. Stevenson, the great-grandson of slaves (and a classmate of mine at Harvard Law School), veered from the usual path of cushy corporate law jobs. Instead, he went south to do the most unforgiving work of all, representing indigent defendants in death penalty cases.  And so Stevenson was listening to the radio in his Honda Civic, parked in front of his Atlanta apartment, when a SWAT cruiser, lights flashing, pulled the wrong way down his one-way street and shone a spotlight at him. Two officers, dressed in military-style gear, got out of the car. Stevenson, figuring he would let them know that everything was OK, exited, too  probably not, in retrospect, the smartest move. One officer drew his gun and pointed it at Stevenson. Move and Ill blow your head off! he shouted.  The officers shoved Stevenson against the car, demanded to know what he was doing on the street and searched his vehicle. The officers said they had been called about a suspected burglar, and that Stevenson should be happy they were letting him go.  Eventually, Stevenson secured an apology and a promise that the officers involved would have to do extra homework on community relations. He wasnt feeling better. The lesson  that you do not have to be underprivileged, or wearing a hoodie, or doing something wrong, to find yourself in such a predicament  is both obvious and worth repeating.  Yet the value of bringing up Stevensons book is not simply to unearth another example of low-level, terrifying harassment. Rather, it is to remind us of the problems that infect the more hidden parts of the criminal justice system. Stevenson ticks off the issues:  The United States has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. ... One in every three black male babies born in this century is expected to be incarcerated. ... Weve sent a quarter-million kids to adult jails and prisons to serve long prison terms, some under the age of 12. ...  Hundreds of thousands of nonviolent offenders have been forced to spend decades in prison. Weve created laws that make writing a bad check or committing a petty theft or minor property crime an offense that can result in life imprisonment. We have declared a costly war on people with substance abuse problems. ... Presumptions of guilt, poverty, racial bias, and a host of other social, structural, and political dynamics have created a system that is defined by error, a system in which thousands of innocent people now suffer in prison. Stevensons life work has been to try to fix this system from his perch at the Equal Justice Initiative, a public-interest law firm he founded in Montgomery, Ala. Sometimes the progress comes individual by individual, as in the innocent people he helped free from death row; sometimes it arrives on a larger scale, as when he persuaded the Supreme Court to abolish the practice of mandatory life without parole for juveniles. Braided through nearly all these cases are the intertwined issues of poverty and race, and the toxic legacies of slavery and segregation. All of which is depressing, but to read Just Mercy is also to be lifted up. Stevensons dedication to the poorest, most helpless clients  children and the mentally ill, the wrongly accused and the abysmally represented, all caught in the unforgiving web of the law  will reaffirm your faith in the capacity of the individual to extract justice from a system that too often seems disinclined to dispense it.

The Washington Post,L,Daesh: John Kerry starts calling the Islamic State a name they hate - The Washington Post," By Adam Taylor December 5 at 2:56 PM  Follow @mradamtaylor      U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry leaves the NATO press room after giving a statement following a round table meeting of the global coalition to counter the Islamic State militant group at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Dec. 3. (Eric Vidal/Reuters)  On Wednesday,John Kerry was speaking at NATO headquartersin Belgium duringa meeting of the United States-led coalition against the Islamic State extremist group. During his remark, the secretary of state made a subtle, yet noteworthy, change to thelanguage he was using: He beganreferring to the Islamic State by a namethey hate. After Kerry'sfirst reference to the group in the speech, Kerrystopped referring to the group as ISIL (short fortheIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant) and instead began referring to them asDaesh, anacronym for the group based on theArabic original. Kerry has rarely used the term Daesh to refer to the Islamic State. In October, he sporadically used the phrase while talking withEgyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo, though he still used ISIL in most references. On Wednesday, however, Kerry referred to the group asDaesh almost exclusively he used the term 16timesand only used ISIL twice. Naming the Islamic State has proved a problem for many organizations since the Sunni Islamist extremist group gained traction in Iraq this year. At first, many referred to it as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or the acronym ISIS. However, due to differences over how thename should be translated from its Arabic original, the U.S. government and some others referred to them as ISIL. The group later announced that it shouldsimply be called the ""Islamic State""  a reference to the idea that the group was breaking down state borders to form anew caliphate and many media organizations (including The Washington Post) began to refer to them this way. That in turn led to some complications: Islamic clerics around the world expressed anger at the extremist group being used to portray all of Islam, and requested that it be called by another name (a group of British imams suggested calling it the ""Un-Islamic State,"" arguing that it was ""neither Islamic, nor is it a state""). In most Arabic nations, however, the group is generally referred to asDaesh.Historian and bloggerPieter van Ostaeyen wrote this yearthat that word wasa transliteration of an Arabic word (), anacronym foral-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham (which isitself atransliteration of the group's Arabic name:    ). The word can be transliterated a variety of different ways:The Washington Post usesDAIISH, butDAASH, DAIISH and DAISH are also used. Some non-Arab countries, including France, have begun using the name, too.""I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists,"" Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters in September. ""The Arabs call it Daesh and I will be calling them the Daesh cutthroats.  Swapping one acronym for another may not seem like too big a deal. But there's an interesting detail here: According to multiple reports, the Islamic State loathes the name. There have been reports of the Islamic State threatening to cut out the tongues ofanyone who used the phrase publicly, perhaps due to the word's similarity to another Arabic word,, or Das, which meansto trample down or crush. The word ""Daeshi"" is used asan insult by anti-Islamic State groups. It's tempting to believe that Kerry was getting his revenge on the Islamic State, which hasinsulted him personally in the past year, butKerrymay just have been showing deference to his audience, many of whom were Arab leaders. On Friday, a State Department spokesperson denied reports that there was any change in policy. ""In routine matters and documents, the Department refers to the terrorist organization as ISIL,"" the spokesperson said."
The Washington Post,L,The best way to respect sexual assault survivors is to get their stories right - The Washington Post," By Alyssa Rosenberg December 5 at 6:52 PM  Follow @AlyssaRosenberg      Protestors carry signs and chant slogans in front of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia late Saturday night, Nov. 22, 2014, in Charlottesville, Va. The protest, the most well-attended of several throughout the day, was in response to the universitys reaction to an alleged sexual assault of a student revealed in a recent Rolling Stone article. (AP Photo/The Daily Progress, Ryan M. Kelly)  The disintegration of the central anecdote in Rolling Stones recent expose of the University of Virginias treatment of sexual assault, A Rape on Campus, began with two questions about one facet of Sabrina Rubin Erdelys reporting: Had she talked to the men who Jackie, a student who told a harrowing story about being gang-raped at a UVA fraternity, accused of assaulting her? Andif she had not interviewed them, was it because they were unavailable, or because Erdely had promised Jackie that she would not contact the men to protect her from retaliation? From that initial question have grown other conversations about the challenges of covering sexual assault cases. Do inconsistencies mean that a source is lying, or are they proof of trauma? What standards of verification should reporters use when dealing with victims ofsexual assault? And what are the risks of using point-of-view stories like Jackies to draw reader attention to systemic issues like campus procedures for handling rape allegations, which affect many students, rather than just one? A Rape on Campus is not only Jackies story. But her account of being assaulted, one after another, by seven men, while two others looked on, is the lede, and it is the part of the piece that has provoked the strongest response. The Washington Post reported multiple discrepencies in Jackies storytoday, and Rolling Stone acknowledged in a note to readers from editor Will Dana that [i]n the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackies account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced. Rolling Stone may not have done the work necessary to verify Jackies story. But while the journalistic choices Erdely and her editors made are serious, they should not be mistaken for definitive proof that Jackie  or any trauma survivor whose story evolves or has gaps  is making up their entire account. As the Dart Center on Trauma and Journalism, which works to establish best practices for reporters who are working with survivors of violence,cautions reporters: Dont be surprised if accounts only make partial sense. Frequently survivors of sexual violence shut down emotionally: their recall may become fragmentary, and in some cases they may even block out an event entirely. Incomplete and contradictory accounts are not prima facie evidence of deception, but rather of the struggle interviewees may experience in making sense of what happened to them. The existence of those inconsistencies doesnt mean reporters shouldnt work to sift through those contradictory or incomplete accounts to verify survivors testimony. The Center for Public Integritys Kristen Lombardi, who five years ago published aa major story on how campuses  including the University of Virginia  handle sexual assault cases, says she felt the best way to protect her sources was to vigorously report out their accounts of their assaults. That meant obtaining their help in getting records of campus disciplinary proceedings, having them sign waivers that gave administrators permission to discuss their cases, and speaking to their alleged assailants. First, though, she did background interviews with survivors, and explained what her reporting process would look like in detail. And she only continued toreport out the stories of victims who were comfortable with what that process would involve. Lombardi says she told sources that doing that level of verification is what I have to do. It doesnt necessarily mean that I dont believe youJust because I have to ask questions and figure out to the best of my ability exactly what happened and talk to everyone whos involved including the alleged perpetrator doesnt mean I dont believe you. It just means, its only going to make this story stronger. And once I did that, most students overwhelmingly were comfortable with that. If her sources did not feel comfortable participating in the verification process, Lombardi decided not to pursue their stories, because it was not worth it to put unwillingpeoplethrough a difficult process. Sadly, that was an option because theres no shortage of campus rape stories out there. You will be able to find students who have gone through the process and are willing to help you verify [their accounts]. Bruce Shapiro, the executive director of the Dart Center,emphasized that vigorous reporting does not have to trade off with sensitivity to victims of sexual assault. I do think that reporters can be vulnerable, empathetic reporters can be vulnerable to thinking that asking tough questions automatically re-traumatizes sources, he told me. Theres a difference between distress and actual trauma. Distress is short-term. Trauma is really damaging to someone in the long run. Theres not a lot of evidence that verifying a story is going to re-traumatize someone. Lombardisaidthat being overly deferential to victims accounts, and making agreements like the one Erdely did with Jackie, might avoid discomfort up front, but that the negative long-term risks were obvious. I see it as ultimately thats who youre protecting. I feel [Jackie], Lombardi said. Her story is being doubted at the highest levelsI think as a reporter, you have a duty to protect your sources and to speak to as many sides as possible. Thats your duty. One of the ways you do that is to make sure you cross every t and dot every i, and make sure you do it with as much care and consideration as you can. Shapiro also argued that trauma reporting frequently presents reporters with a narrative challenge of how to dramatize systematic problems, especially ones about which the public already has strong preconceived ideas. How do you get people engaged in an ongoing way in a national scandal involving the victimization of women? How do you get people engaged when people think they know the story already? Shapiro asked. This is not only true of rape. Its true of stories about torture, about what veterans go through, crime victims. Sometimes focusing on that the details of what happened on the one hand are deeply engaging and are a sourceof empathy by readers, and on the other hand, you dont want those details to take over your story when your storys really about an issue. Weve all ended up focusing on Jackie, is Jackie telling the truth or not, what really happened, who are the perps, instead of on the core issue of how a university responds when a woman walks into a deans office with a serious allegation of sexual assault and when theres a systematic problem on campus, Shapiro continued. The details do matter, of course they matter. But spectacular gotcha details can also distract. In the end, he suggested, I think it would be a mistake to distract from the core issue, which is why this storys so emotional and so powerful, which is the enormous problem of sexual assault on college campuses and the documented inadequacy of response by university administrations. The journalistic tragedy would be if we stopped looking at these stories, or stopped looking at the University of Virginia. "
The Washington Post,L,Happy Hour Roundup - The Washington Post," By Paul Waldman December 5 at 4:57 PM   * Matt OBrien gives a good explanation of why todays job numbers ought to make us cautiously optimistic about where the economy is going. So its pretty unambiguously good news all around: more jobs and maybe, just maybe, higher wages than expected. And if youre into arbitrary round number stats, this is a pretty good one: its the tenth month in a row that the economy has added 200,000 jobs or more, the first time thats happened since 1995.its been the best 12 months for job growth since early 2006, and the best calendar year for it since 1999.  The question now is whether this kind of job growth, if it continues, will get the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates before theyre expected to next June. And the answer, unfortunately, is: maybe? Labor slack, after all, is declining pretty fast. Part-time workers who want full-time jobs fell by 177,000 last month. And so did long-term unemployment by another 101,000. Add in the possibility of people getting raises, which, again, is still in the nascent stage at best, and its clear that the economy is picking up speed. * Which leads to the Tweet of the day, from Jonathan Bernstein: Looking forward to debate over whether GWB tax cuts or future GOP tax cuts responsible for Obama boom. * Jared Bernstein explains how the jobs numbers show the economy is gaining momentum, but warns that if anybody is liable to screw it up, its Congress. * Looks like that transparency thing just isnt convenient at the moment: Secretary of State John Kerry personally phoned Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Friday morning to ask her to delay the imminent release of her committees report on CIA torture and rendition during the George W. Bush administration, according to administration and Congressional officials. Kerry was not going rogue  his call came after an interagency process that decided the release of the report early next week, as Feinstein had been planning, could complicate relationships with foreign countries at a sensitive time and posed an unacceptable risk to U.S. personnel and facilities abroad. Kerry told Feinstein he still supports releasing the report, just not right now. The number of people held accountable for creating an official program of torture remains steady at zero. * Nancy Pelosi warns John Boehner: If you attach any controversial riders to the bill that will keep the government open, you wont get Democratic votes for it. Its unclear whether Republicans will need Dems to keep the government open, but if so, Pelosi will use this leverage.  gs * When Democrats changed Senate rules to allow executive branch nominees to be confirmed on a majority vote, Republicans said it was one of historys greatest crimes. But now theyre thinking about a future with a GOP president, and what do you know, theyre leaning towards deciding to keep the majority-vote rule. * A whole bunch of Republican-controlled states are suing President Obama over his immigration actions. But theres something funny going on: Most states suing over immigration have few immigrants. Of the 17 states suing the federal government  Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin  Texas is the only one where foreign-born residents make up more than 10 percent of the population. Its almost as though the determining factor in whether a state sues is not whether it will incur some harm from Obamas action shielding millions from deportation, but whether its governor really doesnt like Barack Obama. Weird. * And speaking of Republicans complex relationship to Barack Obamas exercise of power, Steve Benen has a good reminder: Weve been waging a quasi-war against ISIS since August, and Congress still hasnt gotten around to debating and voting on whether to authorize it. * Sarah Kliff explains the Obamacare paradox  the law looks terrible but in a variety of ways, its really doing great. * Its often said that Hillary Clinton doesnt open up or emote enough. Here is some pretty candid talk about the personal demands of being president. * The explosive Rolling Stone story about rape at the University of Virginia now appears to be problematic, but Dave Gilson offers a raft of statistics to remind us of just how enormous a problem campus sexual assault remains. * The chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, along with the chairman of a key subcommittee, are calling on the Labor Department to withdraw regulations protecting LGBT employees at government contractors from discrimination. Thats todays modern, inclusive Republican Party. * Ted Cruz appears to think of himself as a Very Serious Statesman. Jennifer Rubin watches him dissolve into incoherence on national security.  gs * As you may have heard, the venerable New Republic magazine was consumed today in a fiery inferno of hubris, foolishness, and betrayal. Daniel Drezner has some wise thoughts on very rich investors who think they know everything about industries they actually know nothing about. * At the American Prospect, I looked at Jeb Bushs strange ideas about the Republican presidential primary and asked whether the infighting among Republicans or Democrats is more severe. * And Ed Kilgore catches Chris Christie refusing to take a position on Eric Garners killing. But he talks tough when he gets in the faces of public employees, so he must be a straight shooter, right?  gs"
The Washington Post,L,Hosni Mubarak celebrates his acquittal while others face repression in Egypt - The Washington Post,"   Egyptian anti-Mubarak protesters chant slogans as they gather in Abdel Moneim Riad Square in Cairo on November 29, 2014. (Mohamed El-Shahed/AFP/Getty Images)   By Editorial Board December 5 at 7:38 PM   WHEN DEPOSED ruler Hosni Mubarak was put on trial in 2011 by the interim military government that succeeded him, we described the prosecution as a travesty. When he was convicted in June 2012 on charges of failing to prevent the killing of demonstrators, we cited Egyptian lawyers who said the verdict ought to be reversed on appeal. That is pretty much what happened last Saturday in Cairo, where a judge threw out the murder charges and acquitted the former strongman on several unrelated corruption counts.  Those who see Mr.Mubaraks clearing as the final step in the reversal of Egypts 2011 revolution nevertheless have a point. Egypts prosecutors and judges cater to the whims of political authorities. When the military was trying to head off mass demonstrations in 2011 demanding justice for those killed during the revolution, prosecutors slapped together a shoddy case against the former president; a court convicted him just as the Muslim Brotherhood was rising to power. Now the military is back in control, the Muslim Brotherhood is banned and its leaders, along with the secular pro-democracy activists who led the revolution, are in prison. So the judiciary knows what to do with Mr.Mubaraks appeals. President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi has re-created the authoritarian regime that Mr.Mubarak headed, only in a far more repressive form. Since the coup he led 17 months ago, the regime has killed more than 1,000 people  including a slaughter of protesters in a Cairo square that, according to Human Rights Watch, was one of the worlds largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history. It has stifled the relatively free press that Mr.Mubarak allowed, cracked down on non-government groups that he tolerated and arrested peaceful Muslim Brotherhood politicians who, during the previous regime, held seats in parliament.  While the former president will likely walk free, along with police officials who ordered the shooting of unarmed demonstrators, hundreds of those who peacefully worked for democracy face long prison sentences. Many, like liberal activists Ahmed Maher and Ahmed Douma, were convicted of violating a draconian law banning protests not approved by the government. Others, like Mohamed Soltan, a dual Egyptian-American citizen, have been held for more than a year without trial.  Mr.Sissis regime is also considerably more hostile to the United States than that of Mr.Mubarak. Though President Obama and Secretary of State John F. Kerry have made it clear that they wish to forge a partnership with Mr.Sissi in spite of his record, the general has turned aside their repeated, deferential appeals that he release a few prisoners so as to justify the full restoration of U.S. military aid. The president hinted recently that the two Al Jazeera journalists with foreign passports might be freed, but they, too, remain in prison as Mr.Mubarak celebrates his acquittal. Several U.S. presidents worked with the Mubarak regime and overlooked its disregard for democracy and human rights. Egypt, meanwhile, failed to develop economically and politically and became a prime source of the Middle Easts Islamic extremist leaders and ideology. Mr.Sissis attempt to restore a 20th-century autocracy is doomed to fail; so is the Obama administrations return to a policy of appeasement.

The Washington Post,L,Phillip Thomas eager to redeem himself with Meriweather doubtful - The Washington Post," By Mike Jones December 5 at 4:40 PM  Follow @mikejoneswapo      Indianapolis wide receiver Donte Moncrief hauls in a long pass against Phillip Thomas in the fourth quarter of the Redskins 49-27 loss. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)  After spending his rookie season on injured reserve and the first nine weeks of this year on the practice squad, and seeing limited action on special teams for four games, safety Phillip Thomas received the most extensive playing time of his NFL career last week against the Indianapolis Colts. The Fresno State product replaced an injured Brandon Meriweather and made a couple of solid tackles against the run. But he also had one of the biggest blunders of the game as he blew a coverage assignment and surrendered a 79-yard touchdown in the 49-27 thrashing. Thomas instantly knew his error on the play. He didnt stay deep on his Cover-2 assignment and instead got caught looking into the backfield. As a result, Thomas got torched by Andrew Luck and wide receiver Donte Moncrief for the longest touchdown of the day. Meriweather remains injured  unable to practice all week  and is listed as doubtful for Sundays game. The Redskins again will have to turn to Thomas, the only other strong safety on the roster. Thomas has spent the week studying and trying to further improve his understanding of the defenses schemes and his responsibilities. He said that he has learned from last weeks mistakes and knows that he must do a better job of trusting the system and executing his responsibilities rather than trying to force plays. Defensive calls will allow me to do certain things and Ive got to stick to it, he said. I get caught up sometimes because I like to see the ball. I like to look at the ball, and I get caught out of position sometimes, looking and seeing too much. I just need to see what I need to see and let my technique take care of the work. The Redskins used a fourth-round pick on Thomas, a former All-American, because of his ball-hawking skills and versatility. The injuries have kept them from seeing the translation to the NFL game. And when he did get his opportunity last week, Thomas didnt deliver. Coaches still believe Thomas has potential, but they need him to find a balance between discipline and aggression. Hes a smart kid. Sometimes gets a little greedy with his eyes and tries to make big plays that arent there, Coach Jay Gruden said. But hopefully, hell learn from it and have a good game. We need him. There are certain coverages where you have the opportunity to be a ball hawk, Gruden also said. But when youre playing back-half and two-man, you dont have that luxury. You have to understand certain coverages and when thats okay. If we put you in position to be a ball hawk, then be a ball hawk. But if youre playing it half-from center or two-deep coverage, youve got to play your two-deep coverage. Pick your spots, but understand he responsibilities of your coverage and where your location is, No. 1, first and foremost, and making a play is secondary. Thomas said as he takes the field Sunday, he will remind himself to be patient and let the game and play-making opportunities come to him. He believes that if he does, he can help answer some of the long-term questions the Redskins have about him, and the safety position. Im just reminding myself this is football, man, and Ive been doing it a long time, Thomas said. Making sure I stay on my reads, stay on my keys and take that technique on what I need to do, and then let my athletic ability and ball skills handle everything else.  Its Brandons position, but I definitely gives me the opportunity to show my worth  that Im in the mix.

The Washington Post,L,Why its so hard to calculate the cost of the Sony Pictures hack - The Washington Post," By Andrea Peterson December 5 at 4:14 PM  Follow @kansasalps      Sony Pictures Entertainment headquarters in Culver City, Calif. (AP Photo/Nick Ut)  The cyberattack on Sony Pictures went far beyond the typical corporate hack -- with attackers allegedly leaking huge amounts of data, including personal information about employees and internal company strategy information. The malware reportedly used in the attack also damaged the underlying systems at the company, making recovery much more difficult than other types of corporate cyberespionage. ""These attacks are pretty devastating,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, principal for security research at Kaspersky Lab. The investigation into the situation could run on for months, and the cleanup will likely cost millions ""if not tens of millions,""he said. Baumgartner cited examples such asretailerTJ Maxx, which he says reported over $250 million in cleanup costs from a 2007 hack, and the Target breach from last year, which he expects will probably run over $400 million in cleanup costs. In 2011, Sony's PlayStation Network was hacked, costing the company anestimated $170 million. The cost to the hackagainst Sony Pictures is complicated to calculate. The company will have to bring in cybersecurity firms to investigate what happened and invest substantial efforts to get their networks up and running again. The studio will suffer lost revenue from films that were stolen and released online by hackers, and it might face legal costs responding to the needs of former and current employees whose personal information has been exposed. Documents allegedly released by the perpetrators of the digital heist may also put a damper on deals in process, or make some Hollywood stars -- some of whom appear to have had their personal data exposed by the attack -- less inclined to do business with the company. ""In the short term, the danger is how do you clean up,"" said Allan Friedman, a computer science professor with a focus on cybersecurity at George Washington University. ""From a long-term perspective they shouldn't be asking themselves 'What have we lost?' but 'How has our potential to grow been compromised?'"" According to data management company Identity Finder, data allegedly leaked by the hackers containedmore than 47,000 Social Security numbers, some belonging to celebrities. And most files containing SSNs included other personally identifiable information, such as full names, dates of birth and home addresses, the company said, which would make it easier to perpetrate identity theft against the victims. Sony Pictures is reportedly providing third-party identity protection services for current employees. But that does little to help former employees whose data was exposed by the hack, as Kashmir Hill at Fusion noted. The attack, which came to light before Thanksgiving, reportedly left employees around the world resorting to pen and paper to do their jobs. ""The disruption to business is probably the largest direct cost, and in the case of Sony they actually had to shut down their network when responding to the incident,"" Baumgartner said. ""You're talking about a company whose revenue is massive. The cash flow is incredible for these businesses, so to be offline for any period of time is extremely costly."" While some of the company's systems were back online by Monday of this week, reports suggest work to restore their technical infrastructure is ongoing. ""Backups and restores are always a best practice, but not every company follows best practices, and people don't test or verify that their backups are clean,""Baumgartner said. In the case of Sony, the company has not disclosed how long attackers were in their system before the attack wreaked havoc on the company. Baumgartner believes that they may have been insidethe system for months, adding complexity to the restoration process as investigators ensure the network backups are clean of an attacker's code. Sony Pictures' internal approach to security may have contributed to the devastating nature of the attack. ""It's clear they did not have their networks well segmented, and the attackers could move freely and destroy data,"" said Baumgartner. Reports indicate the company didn't follow many industry best practices: For instance, passwords may have been saved in clearly labeled files without encryption. Fusion reports that documents leaked after the recent attack show the company hadjust 11 people assigned to its information security team: ""Three information security analysts are overseen by three managers, three directors, one executive director and one senior-vice president."" (Sony Pictures did not respond to requests for comment for this story.) Jason Spaltro, thenexecutive director of information security at Sony Pictures, called it a ""valid business decision to accept the risk of a security breach"" in a 2007 interview with CIO Magazine, adding he would not invest ""$10 million to avoid a possible $1 million loss."" Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, President Obama's nominee for the top spot at the Pentagon, has called for private industry to better guard itself against cyberattacks. ""There's a market failure in the cybersecurity field,"" Carter said at an Aspen Security Forum last year, explaining that private companies underinvest in cybersecurity. Baumgartnerdoubts even the Sony Pictures breach and the string of retail hacks over the past year will get companies to wake up to their own digital vulnerability. ""I think it's going to require lawsuits and more financial losses before companies start to take this seriously,"" he said. But there might at least be one financial bright side to the attack for Sony: Rampant news coverage of the attack and the reported link between the hack and North Korean outrage over ""The Interview"" -- an upcoming action comedy centered on a tabloid journalist being tasked by the CIA with assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong-un -- gave the moviea lot of exposure. ""I think I'm going to go see it now,"" Baumgartner said."
The Washington Post,L,What would happen if the government shut down  and never reopened? - The Washington Post," By Philip Bump December 5 at 3:18 PM  Follow @pbump      (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)  It's unlikely that the government will shut down next week. It's certainly possible, of course; Congress' track record on beating important deadlines of late is mixed. And we'd note that a week before the shutdown in 2013, most people probably figured it would be avoided. So it's unlikely, but it could happen. Fine. The prospect, though, made us wonder: What if it does -- or what if it does at some point in the not-distant future -- and the government doesn't reopen? What if Congress can't reach a deal on a budget, and then can't figure out how to extract itself from the situation? What if the government shut down forever? There are a million reasons this is unlikely. For one, the effects of a long-term shutdown would be so politically toxic that some majority of Congress would certainly agree to reopen the government. For another, a long-term/everlasting shutdown would essentially dismantle the United States. But it's interesting to consider what lies along that path, and where it leads. A shutdown is a budget issue. The government stops performing its usual functions because it (theoretically) can't be certain that it can pay for what it's doing. In 2013, the government shut down for just more thantwo weeks as Republicans stood behind a federal budget that excluded funding for Obamacare, which Democrats insisted be included. Everyone in the room knew that the shutdown would end at some point; within a matter of a few days the issue became about saving political face as much as resolving the core dispute. Employees were promised that they'd be paid for time worked after the shutdown was over. Most government functions kept marching forward, while things like parks and monuments were sort of half-heartedly shuttered. Which Julian Zelizer, political historian at Princeton University, thinks provided a murky picture of the damage a shutdown could do. ""The last round made it plausible that a short-term shutdown is something you could live through. It's not a disaster,"" he said. ""So I imagine that this is going to continue to be something that we continue to see."" The normalization of shutdowns and the limited negative effects on the public, in other words, may mean more, longer shutdowns in future. And that's when bad things might happen. So let's say the government shuts down next week. At first, the same promises would be made: Social Security checks will go out, the military will stay on guard, employees working to make those things happen will get back pay. Now let's say that we pass the two-week mark, and the four-week mark, and the shutdown starts being counted in months. There are two problems: 1) The government needs to actually start shutting things down in a significant way, and 2) it needs to borrow more money from increasingly skeptical lenders. ""It's hard, because almost every program I can think of is something that people want. That's the great puzzle of American politics: People hate government but depend on it and like it when you talk about specifics,"" Zelizer said. ""I don't know what you'd cut because every cut would be politically unpopular."" Among the first to be cut would be programs with weaker political support. We are talking about the decisions being made by actors in a political world, after all. So what goes first? ""Programs for vulnerable people. The food stamp program. Child care. Infant care. These are important programs but they are vulnerable because their constituencies are not constituents with a whole lot of political power,"" Zelizer said. Next in line, regulatory agencies. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) or the EPA or financial regulators would likely see their budgets slashed. There are political benefactors for these things, but compared to other budget priorities, it's easy to see why they'd be cut quickly. Also cut early, per Zelizer: Visa and passport issuance, arts programs, scientific research. The things, in other words, that affect the smallest and least-vocal and -powerful groups of people or affect the powerful and vocal in only minor ways. At this point, it's safe to assume that financial markets would be freaked out. The government has a significant role in the national economy. ""You could see a huge swing in the stock market. ... Federal contracts would dry up, which means that ... cities and suburbs and rural communities across the country that depend on the government would not have the money they were expecting."" It would affect the housing market, as loans from the federal government stop. The closure of parks and museums, a battleground in 2013, would mean sharply reduced revenue in places that depend on tourist money. For those things that the government can't shut down, it would need to take out loans. Imagine that person, sitting in a dark office in the Department of the Treasury, unsure if she'll be paid any time soon, trying her best to twist arms and keep money flowing in. Interest rates would spike as time passed, with creditors increasingly nervous that they'd ever be repaid and exacting a high cost for offering that trust. Incoming tax revenue is never enough to pay our bills by itself; it wouldn't be in this scenario, either. And that's assuming people actually kept paying their taxes, which, over time,might be less and less the case. If the shutdown continued, it's hard to predict the order in which services would go dark. But Zelizer offered his opinion on which things would be maintained until the end. ""Theoretically, Social Security would continue because it's funded on its own,"" he said, and ""that's a big part of what government does."" Air traffic control. Emergency response, in the event of a natural disaster. ""They'd find the revenue to do something. They're not going to allow the kinds of things you see in a Hollywood movie to occur."" National security would be near last on the list as would federal prisons and border control. ""The government is not going to shut those down unless there's a scenario where we've hit rock bottom."" We wouldn't want prisoners released into the public or the borders opened entirely though people might be emigrating more than immigrating by that point. By this point, American society as we know it would have already shifted substantially. It's hard to imagine Congress wouldn't have acted, or, as Zelizer points out, some external factor (like a coup) would have come into play. Jack Rakove, professor of American studies at Stanford University, figures that the country would essentially have reverted to the time of the Articles of Confederation. ""This would become the 21st century of the 'Critical Period,' "" he said, referring to the period just before the adoption of the Constitution. ""The operative word used to describe the state of the national government at the time was that it was moving to the condition of imbecility."" Asked what that would look like, he was blunt. The federal government would ""not look like anything"" if a permanent shutdown kicked in, Rakove said. Instead: ""You can imagine a radical devolution of authority to the states."" That would not necessarily be the paradise that strong states-rights advocates might imagine. ""We remain a nation where lots of aspects of government remain truly national,"" Rakove said. ""It would be hard for Idaho to build a new effective, four-lane superhighway system from Coeur D'Alene to Pocatello."" Not to mention that the national government helps shift funding to the places that need it the most. Wealthier states pay more in taxes than they receive in government services, and vice-versa. States like Alabama or New Mexico or, yes, Idaho  get more from the federal government than they pay out. That trade-off would collapse, at least formally. (And depending on how we got into this situation, wealthier states might be leery about aiding their neighbors.) In short, we'd probably just need to start over. Rakove, a historian, pointed to the Federalist Papers, the initial debate over how a united nation should be composed. In Federalist 37, James Madison writes about the difficulty of crafting the original Constitution. ""The history of almost all the great councils and consultations held among mankind for reconciling their discordant opinions, assuaging their mutual jealousies, and adjusting their respective interests,"" he wrote, ""is a history of factions, contentions, and disappointments, and may be classed among the most dark and degraded pictures which display the infirmities and depravities of the human character."" That's the battle that the creators of the New United States would face -- even after having just fallen victim to precisely that tumult. Rakove did, however, find one silver lining in the everlasting-shutdown scenario: ""It would make work for future historians."""
The Washington Post,L,Is there a Peter Principle for investors? - The Washington Post,"  By Daniel W. Drezner December 5 at 9:45 AM Follow @dandrezner  Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at Tufts University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.      Former TNR literary editor Leon Wieseltier is not a billionaire capitalist. He has felt the effects of one billionaires attempt at disruption, however, and he has the most glorious mane of hair youll ever see. (AP Photo/Dan Balilty)  A decade ago, when I was just a wee blogger, the New Republic asked me to write a monthly online column for them. At the time, TNRs imprimaturfunctioned like a bat signal to other mainstream media outlets, opening up other nonscholarly writing opportunities for me. And for this, Ive always had a soft spot for that magazine. Indeed, after leaving Foreign Policy earlier this year, I came very close to blogging for TNR instead of creating Spoiler Alerts here. So I share the sadness that a lot of reporters and opinion writers are feeling with the bloodletting that happened Thursday at the New Republic: [O]n Thursday, [TNR's] editor, Franklin Foer, and the veteran literary editor, Leon Wieseltier, abruptly resigned in the face of a disagreement over the magazines direction. Mr. Foer was replaced by Gabriel Snyder, a former editor of The Atlantic Wire. The magazine will reduce its publication schedule to 10 issues a year, from 20, [TNR chief executive Guy] Vidra said in a memo, and would be reimagined as a vertically integrated digital media company. Ive got some training in economics, and Im fascinated to know what Vidra thinks he means by vertically integrated digital media company. Because, using the standard textbook definitionof that term, it means that TNR will be going into the silicon mining business and tablet-building business. Vidras general vision of what TNR will look like going forwarddoes readlike someone went to a TED talk in Palo Alto and mined every business cliche possible, as Dylan Byers (who broke the story) explains in Politico: Vidras vision for TNR was radically different than that of Foer and Wieseltier. In meetings with staff, he spoke of the magazine as though it were a Silicon Valley startup, sources said. He talked about disruption and said he wanted to break shit. He referred to himself as a wartime CEO. At one point, he proposed giving every employee shares in the company, suggesting that he had plans to make it public.  Apparently, disruption means acting in as douche-y a manner as possible toward existing employees, as Lloyd Grove explains over at the Daily Beast:  According to informed sources, [TNR owner Chris] Hughes and Vidra didnt bother to inform Foer that he was out of a job. Instead, the editor was placed in the humiliating position of having to phone Hughes to get confirmation after Gawker.com posted an item at 2:35 p.m. reporting the rumor that Bloomberg Media editor Gabriel Snyder, himself a onetime Gawker editor, had been hired as Foers replacement. Yes, its true, Hughes sheepishly admitted, notwithstanding that he and Vidra had given Foer repeated assurances that his job was safe. There are already a whole mess ofeulogies for the TNR-that-was, but whats striking to me is that this is hardly the first clash this year between a billionaire titan and the new business venture that hes running. Think of the culture clashes over at First Look Media, or even the Wall Streetersdubious management plan for reviving the Philadelphia 76ers. These clashes go beyond the for-profit realm.Peter Thiel keeps yammeringabout how theres gonna be a revolution in higher education, but Im not really seeing it. Similarly, in my Ideas Industry conferences, Ive heard a lot of nonprofit sector folk complaining that Silicon Valley investors want to revolutionize their field without really understanding it. The pattern in each of these cases is that a fabulously wealthy and successful investorenters a new and not-terribly-successful sector and tries to apply the lessons learned from the investors past successes to this new area. Except thattheres not a ton of evidence that those lessons are truly generalizable. One almost wonders if there is an extension of the Peter Principle for investors. To be clear, Im actually a big fan of the creative destruction that should come with a properly functioning capitalist economy. Usually, however, that creative destruction emanates from real technologicalinnovations. Whats going on at TNR sounds more like asuccessful investormoving into less successful areas of endeavor and finding that disruption for its own sake is not necessarily a formula for success. The irony of all of this is that while TNR was never good at producing a profit, it really excelled as an incubator for journalists and writers. As Ezra Klein points out, there are a lot of TNR-like entities out there now, so perhaps this isnt that huge of a blow. Still, the way that Hughes has botched his handling of this TNR shakeup suggests that maybe billionaire investors should pause once or twice before thinking that they know how to revolutionize every sector of the economy.

Bill OLeary/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.        By Aaron C. Davis and Mike DeBonis December 5 at 8:11 PM  Follow @byaaroncdavis Follow @mikedebonis    Marion Barry carved one last, larger-than-life path through the District on Friday as his casket proceeded through the city on a three-hour journey to a memorial service in the heart of Southeast Washington. Schoolchildren lined sidewalks, toddlers stood in salute, a surprise marching band fell in stride, and Clydesdales and a brass band kept cadence for the final steps to the church. Along the way, thousands of camera phones raised for one last glimpse, chants of mayor for life rang out along District thoroughfares, and more than a few drivers rolled their eyes as a 20-minute trip lasted more than three hours. Stranded commuters aside, the slow-moving procession amounted to a welcomed delay for Barrys admirers before the grim task awaiting Saturday to eulogize and bury the citys most famous personality. Pamela Jordan, a social worker at Capital City Public Charter School, took the day off even though first lady Michelle Obama was scheduled to visit her school.      Three days of memorial events have begun for longtime D.C. mayor Marion Barry. His casket arrived Thursday morning at the Wilson Building, where the public is paying their respects. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)   Ive got two more years to see her, Jordan said, waiting for the procession to pass along Southern Avenue. This is once in a lifetime. Like so many others who dotted the eight-mile route Friday, Jordan as well as Tiesha Crawford credited Barrys jobs programs as mayor for their first paychecks and opening their eyes to potential careers. It made me realize I could do something, said Crawford, 35, who got a summer job as a teenager working as a file clerk. I didnt have to just be out on the streets. I didnt have to sell drugs. Crawford said she is looking for a job again but is confident shell find one. She said she met Barry only once, at an Easter church service where she hugged him. Nobody did care very much about this side of the city until he came along, she said. As the procession approached, Crawford began to cheer. The tribute began early Friday at the citys John A. Wilson Building on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, where until midnight Thursday past mayors and D.C. council members had taken turn keeping vigil as hundreds poured through to pay their respects. Among the last handful to do so was Felicia Gregory, 57, of Mount Pleasant. She had taken a bus with her 6-year-old foster daughter, Caprice, to bid farewell.     A brass band from the United House of Prayer church played as the casket of longtime D.C. mayor Marion Barry arrived at Temple of Praise in Southeast D.C. on Friday. (Hamil Harris/The Washington Post)   He was special, said Gregory. He did a lot, although no ones perfect. ... He communicated with the people. Thats what we wanted: Just be fair. Shortly after she spoke, Mayor Vincent C. Gray emerged from the building to escort members of Barrys family. An honor guard marched into a light rain as Barrys casket was carried to a waiting black hearse adorned with American flags. Flanked by dozens of police vehicles and limousines for Barrys family, the procession became a rolling testament to the mark the former four-term mayor and 15-year council member left on the city. It passed landmarks that reflected both the duration of his time in the public eye and his ups and downs along the way. In the first mile, Barrys hearse traveled past the Justice Department and the federal courthouse where his battle with drug charges in 1990 became fused with his legacy. During his trial for cocaine possession, the plaza outside the courthouse became known as Barry Beach, where supporters camped out on the sweltering concrete. As the procession turned south in front of the U.S. Capitol, partisan politics was hard to escape. As Hill staffers clutched coffee cups and umbrellas, hurrying along wet sidewalks, one asked, Whats that for? Told the caravan was for Barry, the man in a dark overcoat and scarf grumbled. Drama. It figures. He declined to give his name  then I just look like an angry Republican, he said. As the caravan crossed the new 11th Street Bridge into Anacostia, however, the mood was more festive in the working-class neighborhoods that Barry long represented. There, his downtrodden constituents had empathized with his plea for a second chance after his drug conviction. Traffic on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE was at a standstill as Barrys procession passed. Motorists honked horns in celebration of his life, and in frustration. Some waved Barry posters from car windows. The crowd around the Big Chair public artwork buzzed as the first motorcycle cop passed. Here he comes, people began to say as they lined the street, shoulder to shoulder. Always fighting for the people, one man shouted. Barry, another man yelled. Mayor for life, the crowd shouted back. The call-and-answer continued. Outside the Anacostia Metro station, Ballou High Schools marching band appeared unexpectedly. The motorcade paused, and some began to dance  a party atmosphere befitting Barry, who often seemed happiest at the center of a rollicking affair. Crowds cheered as the caravan passed the Southeast Tennis and Learning Center begun by Barrys wife, Cora Masters Barry. Later, it stopped at the Players Club bar that Barry frequented, and his homes over the decades in Southeast Washington. Rahim Jenkins, a veteran Southeast community activist, said that felt right. Marion Barry loved Ward 8. This was the pulse of the city and the part that Marion loved, Jenkins said. It was appropriate for him to be brought back here because while the people loved Marion Barry, he loved them more. Near the end, the procession paused at United Medical Center, where the former mayor died early Nov. 23. A police honor guard hoisted the casket out of the hearse and onto a horse-drawn caisson as the family watched. One member of the retinue gasped upon seeing the two Clydesdales. I told you Im not playing around. Were not playing around with this, replied Masters Barry, who meticulously planned most aspects of the elaborate processional, along with Barrys son, Christopher, and his close aides. At 12:41 p.m., the caisson driven by two men in black top hats entered the parking lot of Temple of Praise. A second brass band that had joined in the caravan broke into a jaunty tune as people crowded around the casket snapping pictures and dignitaries filed into the church. A memorial service there Friday night was the penultimate tribute event. With a capacity crowd filling the 3,000-seat sanctuary, the voices of a choir soared and a large contingent of ministers swayed before the alter. Barrys body lay in repose with hundreds of red roses piled on his casket. Has anyone ever gotten a job because of Marion Barry, one minister asked at the beginning of the service. Hundreds applauded and said, Amen. Community activist Tyrone Parker spoke and likened Barry to a Phoenix bird that rose from the ashes and touched the hearts of his constituents. But as he rose, he looked down upon us and touched our hearts, Parker said.  Keith L. Alexander, Moriah Balingit, John Woodrow Cox, Hamil R. Harris, Arelis R. Hernandez, Miles Parks, Michael E.

The Washington Post,L,"A jogger saved Mike Wises life. Six years later, the columnist got to repay him. - The Washington Post"," By Mike Wise December 5 at 6:00 AM  Follow @MikeWiseguy         The Washington Post's Mike Wise returns to the canal where he almost drowned with the man who saved him. (Gillian Brockell and Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)   Before their big day began, I kept telling myself the same thing, over and over. Its not about you, its about them. Its their moment. You need to be in control of your words and emotions at all times. You cant lose it.  We had assembled before about 75 of their closest family and friends in front of the Havana-themed back room of the historic restaurant with its verdant tropical garden. On the Saturday before Labor Day in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, it was the radiant young bride, the handsome young groom with the jet-black thatch and beard and  me, the middle-aged bald minister who would marry them. Oh, and the couples cat/first child stood sentry in the background in the form of an 8-by-10 framed picture, unofficially presiding over the ceremony.  Hi, Sal Cat, I said, addressing the photo in the welcome. Alexandra Marie Squitieri and Jason Daniel Coates laughed. If they were nervous, they didnt show it. Next to me, in point of fact, they were remarkably calm. From my first words, I was afraid I would begin crying. When Jason and Alex first asked me to perform their wedding, my initial thought was, my wife is not going to believe I get to be a minister for a day, I began. My second thought was how honored I was to be asked. The reason is simple: Without Jason, I am not here today. Before I tell you the story of how they came into each others lives, let me tell you the story of how Jason came into mine.    Sports columnist Mike Wise, right, was rescued by Jason Coates after he fell through the ice on the C&O Canal while trying to save his dog, Looly. (Andr Chung/For The Washington Post)    On a cold January night in 2008 I was in the middle of the frozen-over C&O Canal, less than a quarter-mile south of Chain Bridge , unable to get out. While we were jogging, my golden Lab, Looly, went out onto the ice and fell through, and I went in after her. After several minutes I managed to put my arm under her abdomen and jerk her up onto a solid piece of ice. But I couldnt touch bottom, and by then I could barely move. My body was shutting down. Out of nowhere, as I screamed for help, a figure appeared. He lowered his body into the freezing water as far he could without losing his balance. He reached for me. And when I lunged, finally touched the bottom and got closer to shore, he grabbed my hand, pulled me out and we went up the bank together. I was going to make it, and Looly didnt have to go home with someone else that night. I was in shock from hypothermia. He said he was cold, too, making sure Looly and I were all right. Freezing, out of breath, I asked him his name and where he worked.  Jason. Jason Coates, he said. Im in law school at GW. And he took off again  like some superhero who just shows up when people are in dire need. I did choke up once as I told that story. It happened when I looked up and caught my wifes smile. I would never have met Christina. We wouldnt have had Oliver, who is 4 years old and was sitting in her lap. And there wouldnt have been another child on the way if Jason hadnt pulled me from the canal.     In 2008, Mike Wise was minutes from freezing to death after falling through the ice in the C&O Canal. (Andr Chung/For The Washington Post)    Over the next six years, eating wood-fired pizza together was Jasons and my routine. I helped him get a summer internship clerking for a Queens civil court judge. Twice on the anniversary of our encounter, I had him on my former radio show to retell the story. He was with me on the day I married my wife, so being there the day he wed Alex had karmic symmetry.  There is a saying that goes, Luck is the residue of design, and this to me is Jason, I told the attendees. Good things happened to Jason not because he was lucky. With all his actions prior to this morning, he planned this amazing day and probably didnt even know it. Short of saving Jasons life, one of the most meaningful things I could do for him was to preside as minister at his wedding. Becoming ordained, in fact, turned out frighteningly easy for a heathen like me.  I filled out a form for the Universal Life Church, and within days, my $29 fee came with an official minister card.  The morning of the wedding, I whipped out my card before I signed the marriage certificate, feeling  if Im being honest  like I could be a man of God. For, like, a day.     Jason Coates was jogging when he saw Mike Wise in the icy water. (Andr Chung/For The Washington Post)     Just dont lose it. Dont cry.  After I told of Jasons courageous moment, I noticed some in the audience covering their mouths. I could tell they had not read or known about the original story I had written in the Washington Post Magazine about it. Two women were weeping. I finally turned to the bride:  So, Alex, not that I have to tell you, but you are marrying a real-life hero. And, Jason, not that I have to tell you, but you are marrying someone equally good at looking out for others. I know this because you told me yourself. A couple of months before, I had asked Jason and Alex to write letters to one another. But instead of giving them to each other, I asked they give them only to me so I could get a better sense of their relationship. I promised I would not embarrass them.  They had met through mutual friends. After their first date  a day at the National Zoo  they ended up at the Firehook Bakery in Cleveland Park, where Jason thought he would show off his ability to devour pastries. He gorged himself. Crashing from his sugar high, he fell asleep on the train ride back home.  I looked out at the attendees around their tables and said, I like to imagine Alex looking at him, passed out on the Metro next to her in that moment, thinking, Yep, hes a keeper.  More laughter. The humor was good camouflage. I was confident Id make it through the ceremony. There was the story of Jason indulging Alexs spontaneity, going out in the gale-force winds and rain of Hurricane Irene and her finding out, only after they returned sopping wet from head to toe: Jason really hates getting wet  a notable irony, given how Jason and I met. The problem with heroes is, of course, theyre sometimes so good at saving everybody else they forget to do little things for themselves. Like get real furniture, go to the dentist and set up a retirement account, all of which Alex encouraged Jason to do. In the letter he wrote Alex, you could tell he loved the way she balanced her childlike exuberance for life with her personal responsibility. You have suggested a few times that, when we have a bigger place to live, we should get a young cat to keep Sal company, Jason wrote. When I told you that I was worried that a younger cat might take our attention away from Sal, you told me that our hearts would expand to love the new cat just as much as we love Sal. I agree with that. Being with you always makes me feel at home, Jason wrote Alex. Being with you and Sal makes me feel like I am exactly where I belong. Alex was less cynical about the world and more open to life experiences because of Jason, she wrote. She is really looking forward to being his life partner for many reasons, but most of all so I can hang out in my pajamas with you and watch reruns of The Office. The vows, the exchange of rings and the kiss, after I pronounced them man and wife, went by so quickly. The entire ceremony lasted less than 20 minutes. Even if Jason werent my son, Id be proud of him and who he is, Jason fathers said to me after the ceremony. I understood entirely.     Six years after Jason pulled Mike to safety, Mike officiated at his wedding ceremony. (Andr Chung/For The Washington Post)    When everybody was mingling inside, I took a moment for myself and walked into the front of the restaurant, outside the tropical garden. As I had when Jason ran back to Georgetown that night in January after pulling me out, I let go of heaving sobs  the sobs of a man who knew how close he came to never seeing this beautiful day  and all those that had come before it.

The Washington Post,L,Children who are prostituted arent criminals. So why do we keep putting them in jail? - The Washington Post,"  By Andrea Powell December 5 at 10:57 AM Follow @AndreaFAIRGirls  Andrea Powell is the founder and executive director of FAIR Girls, a nonprofit based in Washington D.C. dedicated to providing care for girl survivors of human trafficking.      (Leanne Surfleet/Flickr)  A 13-year-old runaway was gang raped by 10 men for several hours in a Texas apartment last year. When she was rescued, authorities took her to a hospital where she was given a rape kit, which was used along with her account to quickly find two of her assailants, who were charged with felony sexual assault of a child. Now consider the story of another 13-year-old girl, who was sold by a pimp to dozens of men throughout Washington, D.C. She experienced the same pain, fear, trauma, and abuse as the first child. But when an undercover officer, posing as a John, encountered her in a hotel room, she was arrested for prostitution and sent to juvenile jail. The men who bought her (or, more correctly, raped her) walked away free. That our society labels one of these girls a criminal and the other a victim is unjust. Ultimately, both were sent to treatment centers, but the second had the added trauma of going through the penal system and carrying an arrest record. This difference is based in a deeply rooted misunderstanding that the second girl made a choice because she was paid. Since she has a pimp, she is no longer considered a victim of statutory rape and sexual abuse. This misguided notion leads police to arrest more than 1,000 victimized children a year for prostitution  a crime they arent even capable of committing. Federal law mandates that minors cannot willingly be involved in prostitution, but this rule isnt uniformly enforced. Local and state jurisdictions must go a step further to ensure these children arent treated as criminals. Only 12 states have Safe Harbor laws that prohibit the arrest of children for prostitution-related crimes. This week, Washington D.C. joined the group, passing the Sex Trafficking of Minors Prevention Act. The D.C. law has an added provision mandating that the children are connected to emergency and long-term services, such as housing, through organizations like mine, FAIR Girls. But while these children cant be arrested for prostitution, many are instead jailed for truancy, being a runaway and other minor violations. The majority of FAIR Girlss 45 minor clients (we have 125 clients total, aged 11 to 24) last year were arrested for such crimes. Without effective training for law enforcement and a comprehensive trafficking response model, the vast majority of child victims are simply locked up anyway. When they are released from jail, they often go further underground where they areexploited by traffickers again. Opponents of Safe Harbor laws fear prosecutors and law enforcement will lose their power to persuade children to testify in court against their traffickers. But the truth is that children who are given quality services are more likely to give honest testimony than those who are forced under threat of arrest. To truly work, Safe Harbor laws must include funding to make sure those services are available. In Washington D.C., FAIR Girls is pushing for the District to fund a mobile trafficking response team that can quickly provide trained professionals and services whenever police encounter a potential child trafficking situation. The team would connect the child with long-term housing, intensive counseling, educational support, mentoring, and safety planning, which FAIR Girls currently provides with funding from the federal Office of Victims of Crime, private foundations and individual donors. At about $125 a day, those services cost 50 percent less than theaverage priceof keepinga child incarcerated. On average, our clients were first trafficked at 12 to 14 years old. Ninety percent are American citizens, and all have experienced sexual abuse or domestic violence prior to being trafficked. Traffickers target the vulnerable to exploit their weaknesses. They target runaways and homeless youth, mainly girls, by offering them a safe place to sleep or pretending to be their boyfriends.These children are victims, and it is our responsibility to care for them. It is time that the law enforcement and criminal justice systems treat child sex trafficking like what it really is  organized rape for profit. More from Posteverything:  My own rape shows how much we get wrong about these attacks Im a black woman with a white husband. People assume Im a prostitute all the time. Bill Cosby raped me. Why did it take 30 years for people to believe my story? "
The Washington Post,L,Heres how Landrieus kitchen sink strategy against Cassidy has sounded - The Washington Post," By Sean Sullivan December 5 at 4:05 PM  Follow @WaPoSean      Senator Mary Landrieu speaks to a supporter on December 2, 2014 in Gretna, Louisiana. (Photo by Edmund D. Fountain for The Washington Post)  Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) has spent the final week of her long-shot campaign to keep her job using an assortment of attacks against Rep. Bill Cassidy (R), zigging and zagging from one issue to another as she barnstorms the state. In contrast, Cassidy's closing argument is the same one he has used for the duration of the campaign: Senator Landrieu represents Barack Obama. I represent you."" Often, the candidate who is shifting attack patterns is trailing. Polls show this race is no exception. (After all, if your criticism is resonating with voters, why change it up?) Here's a snapshot of all the different things Landrieu has had to say about Cassidy this week, veering from the political to the personal category, and even touching on the legal: 1. ""If you are going to refer to the president of the United States, he's at least earned the title that the people gave him when they elected him."" Landrieu accused Cassidy Tuesday of being ""disrespectful"" to President Obama. Asked what she meant, the senator responded: ""He refers to him by his last name. Constantly."" Her argument was akin to the one Rep. Cedric Richmond (D) made in a Landrieu ad geared at African American voters. 2. He's not man enough. Bloomberg's Dave Weigel sums up it up: Landrieu's feminization of Cassidy (for not being accessible) is something to watch. She contrasted him with Rob Maness: ""He was a MAN.""  daveweigel (@daveweigel) December 3, 2014  3. ""He's going to be fighting more than the president. He's going to be fighting subpoenas."" Landrieu has spent much of time on the trail trying to convince voters Cassidy may have committed payroll fraud as a part-time employee at Louisiana State University. He denies any wrongdoing; LSU is looking into the matter. 4. ""I hope we don't let him run out the clock."" Landrieu is correct is pointing out that Cassidy has been absent from the campaign trail this week. His Friday events with Sen.-elect Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) a day before the Saturday runoff election are his first campaign appearances in the state since he appeared in the final debate on Monday. 5. ""We have a person with virtually no record."" Landrieu and her allies have been arguing that Cassidy's congressional record is thin and stands in contrast to her many years of delivering for Louisiana voters in Washington. It's a sweeping array of attacks. On Saturday, she'll find out if any of those punches landed."

The Washington Post,L,"U.S. economy added 321,000 jobs in November; unemployment rate holds at 5.8% - The Washington Post"," By Chico Harlan December 5 at 12:41 PM  Follow @chicoharlan   A months-long hiring spree has pushed the U.S. labor market closer to full health, providing workers with their best chance since the financial crisis to find higher-paying jobs or enjoy see long-awaited wage increases. On Friday, the government announced that the U.S. economy added 321,000 jobs in November, the best figure in nearly three years, keeping the country on track for the strongest annual job growth since the late 1990s. That performance, coming even as other advanced economies slump, has lifted hopes among economists and U.S. officials that a slow, six-year recovery is beginning to yield substantial benefits for ordinary workers. Workers are not only reentering the labor force from the sidelines, data show, but also growing increasingly likely to have the to confidence to quit their jobs and move to better ones that pay more or more closely match their skills.  We are kind of hitting that point where the tide is turning, and the labor market is more in favor of the worker than it has been in many years, said Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed.com, a job search Web site. For several years, the U.S. recovery has felt stubbornly incomplete: Jobs have come back while wages have stagnated. But the latest numbers came with nascent signs of wage growth, the result of qualified individuals reentering the workforce, putting pressure on companies to retain their best employees or bid for new applicants. According to Labor Department data Friday, average hourly wages spiked 0.37 percent from October to November, the sharpest month-to-month change in more than a year. If salaries continue to grow, economists say, Americans will be taking home more money even as they spend less as the pump, due to falling oil and gasoline prices. The potent combination wouldboost the amount of money Americans have to spend and provide a broader lift to the economy. Still, economists said it was far too early to declare that a robust wage recovery had begun. Over the course of a year, hourly earnings are still up only 2.1 percent, just a tick above the inflation rate, but weekly earnings provide a more encouraging sign. The average American last month took home $853.24 per month  a 2.4 percent increase from the $833.18 figure of a year earlier  partly because of working longer hours. One month does not make a trend, but I am encouraged, Department of Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez said Friday in an interview. One of the best ways to lift wages is to pick up the pace of job creation, which is exactly what were doing. Because job creation will trigger more upward pressure on wages. Some economists said that Novembers data has put the American economy in its best position in years. The unemployment rate remains at 5.8 percent, a post-recession low point. So far this year, the United States has added some 2.65 million jobs, an average of about 241,000 a month. For 10 straight months now, the economy has added at least 200,000 jobs. That hasnt happened since 1994. President Obama said on Friday that the United States has added more jobs over the last four years than Europe, Japan, and all other advanced countries combined. Other U.S. officials noted that job growth in November was driven by traditionally blue-collar or higher-skill sectors, a contrast to the low-wage boom earlier in the recovery. In November, the business and professional services sector  accountants, engineers, administrators  added 86,000 jobs, tops among all industries. This year, the country has added about 15,000 manufacturing jobs per month, more than double the pace from 2013. Construction has added about 21,000 per month this year, compared with 13,000 per month in 2013. The labor market is healing faster than almost any analysts expected just a few months ago, Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, said Friday. In one sign of labor market confidence, workers have grown more likely to quit their jobs, meaning theyve either received new employment offers or feel confident they will. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the quit rate, as it is known, now stands at 2.2 percent among private workers. From July 2008 to July 2014 the rate never surpassed 2 percent. People grow likelier to leave their jobs when the broader economy is functioning well, and in recent months, some have taken positions they couldnt find earlier in the recovery. Others have left jobs they disliked and reentered the hunt. Some, like Daniel Ovalles, 25, have found new jobs they never even expected. Ovalles, who has an engineering degree from Texas A&M, has the kind of story that would have sounded jarring a few years earlier: An opportunity literally landed in his LinkedIn inbox. At the time he received the note, Ovalles was working a terrific job that was also a major grind. He spent his time in the remote Texas oilfields as a field engineer for Schlumberger, an oil services company. Ovalles made $150,000 annually, but he was on the road so often that he didnt even have an apartment. Hed bounce from job to job  Midland, Tex.; Laredo; Victoria  working 12-hour shifts, spending his down time in a mobile trailer he shared with three other employees. The e-mail came from Murray Services, a Houston-based staffing and recruiting agency that has doubled its own staff in the last year to keep pace with increased demand  likely the result of a stronger overall economy combined with a domestic energy boom. Murray contacted Ovalles on behalf of BC Johnson, a risk management consulting firm that specializes in the energy industry. Murray noticed Ovalles LinkedIn profile  his oil field work; his fluency in Spanish  and thought hed be a good fit. Ovalles, at first, didnt pay the inquiry any attention. Then he spent three more weeks in the field. Thats when you start going crazy, he said. So I looked at it again. He put in his two-weeks notice and thanked Schlumberger for the opportunity. Now, in his new job, which he started in October, Ovalles works from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. He has a 15-minute commute from his apartment. His salary is slightly reduced, but he feels he traded up, taking an opportunity that might not have been available several years earlier. You have to have that life balance, he said, and in my old job I didnt.   "
The Washington Post,L,"The Galapagos might lose some of their best researchers, and theyre blaming the gift shop - The Washington Post"," By Darryl Fears December 5 at 10:01 AM  Follow @bydarrylfears      (AP/Google)  It is the gift shop that will not keep on giving. For years, the Charles Darwin Foundation's Research Station on the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador operated a small store to help it get by in lean times -- selling mostly clothing with the foundation's logo. But then it added swimsuits, sunglasses, Ecuadorian chocolate and artwork, and the local traders cried foul. The town's mayor agreed and shut down the store. Now the oldest and most prominent research organization in the famed archipelago that inspired Darwin's masterwork ""On the Origin of Species"" says that, as a result of the loss of the store, it is flat broke and could cease to exist before Christmas.      This promotional video released by the Charles Darwin Foundation in September highlights the group's conservation efforts on the Galapagos Islands. (The Charles Darwin Foundation)   ""I think the correct expression is the situation is touch and go,"" said Swen Lorenz, the foundation's chief executive. ""We are possibly only a few weeks away"" from closing. His pleas to donors as part of an attempt to quickly raise $1 million have fallen on deaf ears. The shuttering of the bright yellow gift shop was, perhaps, the fatal blow for the storied foundation. Donors, academics and scientists say the loss of the roughly $32,000 a month the shop generated pushed the organization more deeply into a hole it had been digging for some time. They said the foundation did not live within its $3.5 million annual budget, even as donations shrank over the past 20 years. In other words, they said, the foundation is facing extinction because it failed to heed Darwin's signature observation: To survive, it needed to evolve and adapt. If the foundation goes bankrupt as expected, the Galapagos would lose its most knowledgeable research team that, during a half-century of existence, amassed an enormous database of animal specimens in one of the world's most biodiverse archipelagos. Its work has saved birds such as the mangrove finch from likely extinction and has helped preserve everything from giant tortoises to plant varieties. The research station has served ""as a conduit for international support of conservation in Galapagos,"" said Peter Grant, a Princeton University biologist who has conducted research there. ""If the foundation fails, it's anybody's guess what will happen. We have not heard of any contingency plans."" But today it is far from the only research outfit in the emerald islands that comprise the Galapagos. Even the Galapagos Conservancy in Fairfax, a group founded solely to fund the foundation, is giving more and more money to its competitors. Under the U.S. tax code, it could not donate to a single entity overseas, said Johannah Barry, founder and president of the conservancy. So it has spread its wealth to other research groups in the archipelago while significantly cutting funds to the foundation. Regardless, critics said, the foundation clings to around 60 employees it can scarcely afford. ""The budget situation they find themselves in is complex and not new,"" said Barry. She's doubtful it can survive. ""It's deeply unfortunate. There are people I've worked with there for two decades who are in dire straits."" Operating a research station 550 miles off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean comes at a high price, Lorenz said. The foundation's operating budget is split between costs for overhead and science, including employees, lab equipment, boats and gear. It is charged more than $50,000 alone each year for Internet access and $36,000 for electricity. Lorenz said in Wednesday that the foundation has cut staff. When he arrived about threeyears ago, there were 105 employees; now there are 65. There's no science director, only a consultant. There's only one person dedicated to fundraising on site, making the goal of raising money nearly impossible. That's why a store that raised $300,00o a year was important. ""There are some redundant staff in our organization,"" Lorenz acknowledged. But it's cheaper to keep them, he said, because Ecuadorian labor laws require workers to receive severance based on length of employment and salary. ""In July, I paid off one long-standing staff [member] at a cost of $150,000."" Lorenz added: ""We have some outside people criticizing us for all sorts of aspects, but their knowledge of the ...situation on the ground is fairly limited."" There's not enough will to rescue the struggling foundation, some say, and even less money. Dennis Geist, the foundation's president, said he's not optimistic about potential donors. ""The outlook's bleak right now,"" he said. The foundation and research center were established in 1959, 100 years after Darwin's signature work, along with the Galapagos National Park, whose conservationists used data collected at the center.          1 of 13       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                       Skip Ad              Creatures of the Galapagos    View Photos   These animals species influenced Charles Darwins theory of evolution.

For three decades, the foundation was out there nearly alone, a star among research operations, with the best scientists and best research. It remains the most respected in the islands. But nearly half a dozen newer and highly regarded research organizations are now established there, including the Galapagos National Park, World Wildlife Fund and San Francisco de Quito University, and each is poised to at least take over parts of the Darwin foundation's mission. If needed, they could start filling a gap left by the foundation as soon as January, Barry said. In a telephone interview Tuesday, Lorenz said he is working hard to avoid that. Contradicting the foundation's critics, he insists that the financial woes are connected to revenue lost when Leopoldo Bucheli Mora, mayor of the Municipality of Santa Cruz, ordered the gift shop to close in July. The shop had operated at the research station's headquarters in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island since the early 1990s, selling goods mostly to eco-tourists. But it became the target of heated protests after the January expansion. Local vendors complained that the gift shop had entered into direct competition with their own stores. In March, the vendors complained to the mayor, who sided with his constituents, saying the expansion lacked a proper permit.. Bucheli Mora declined to comment to The Washington Post on events that led to the gift shop's closure. But local newspapers, such as El Comercio, reported that he issued an ultimatum: Go back to selling only books and assorted items with the foundation's logo, and stop selling bathing suits, chocolate and art. When the foundation declined, the mayor refused its operating permit. Lorenz called the decision ""an abuse of power."" He said the national government supports the foundation, and so does the national park. But he acknowledged that neither has challenged the mayor. ""I'm obviously very flabbergasted,"" Lorenz said. ""We've been in this country a long time."" Not everyone is sure that the mayor's action was out of bounds, and even if it was, picking a fight with a foreign municipality seems ill-advised, several critics said. ""It's very important for institutions to adapt and adopt,"" Barry said. "
The Washington Post,L,Jayson Werth in court is exactly what youd imagine Jayson Werth in court to be like - The Washington Post," By Marissa Payne December 5 at 4:05 PM  Follow @marissapayne      (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)  Its fair to say Washington Nationals outfielder Jayson Werths had better days. On Friday, the 35-year-old was found guilty of reckless driving and sentenced to 10 days in jail in a Virginia court. He was allegedly going 105 mph on the Beltway when he was pulled over by Virginia State troopers on July 6 in Fairfax County. So what was his explanation? Pretty much exactly what you might imagine Werth would say.   State trooper said he asked Jayson Werth what he was doing driving 105 mph. ""Pressing my luck,"" Werth said.  Tom Jackman (@stateofnova) December 5, 2014  Yes, according to the Washington Posts Tom Jackman, Werth told the judge he was pressing his luck when asked by the judge what he was doing surging to 105 mph on the Beltway, where speed limits hover between 55 mph and 65 mph. As for what he looked like in court, those who worried he mightve cleaned up his scruffy look can calm down. Per the Washington Posts Justin Jouvenal, he did not visit a barber beforehand.   Per reader questions: Werth did not shave his beard for court or trim his long hair. Was wearing a charcoal colored suit and glasses.  justin jouvenal (@jjouvenal) December 5, 2014  All joking aside, going to jail is a serious matter, which Nats General Manager and President of Baseball Operations Mike Rizzo recognizes. He issued a statement roughly two hours after the verdict came down via the Posts James Wagner.   Mike Rizzo in a statement: ""We are aware of the Judge's ruling today.

The Washington Post,L,Rolling Stones disastrous U-Va. story: A case of real media bias - The Washington Post," By Erik Wemple December 5 at 5:56 PM  Follow @ErikWemple      People gather with signs during a protest at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville on Saturday, Nov. 22, 2014. (AP Photo/The Daily Progress, Ryan M. Kelly)  On Slates DoubleX Gabfest podcast last month, reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely explained why she had settled on the University of Virginia as the focus for her investigative story on a horrific 2012 gang rape of a freshman named Jackie at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. First I looked around at a number of different campuses, said Erdely. It took me a while to figure out where I wanted to focus on. But when I finally decided on the University of Virginia  one of the compelling reasons that made me focus on the University of Virginia was when I found Jackie. I made contact with a student activist at the school who told me a lot about the culture of the school  that was one of the important things, sort of criteria that I wanted when I was looking for the right school to focus on. Rolling Stone thought it hadfound the right campus and the right alleged crime: Following her Nov. 19 story on Jackies alleged assault in a dark room at the Phi Kappa Psi house, the university suspended all fraternity activities and a national spotlight fell on the issue of campus rape. Now its all falling apart. Thanks to several days of reporting by the Washington Posts T. Rees Shapiro, Rolling Stones account is not even a semester away from becoming part of journalism classes around the country. Jackies friends now doubt her account of the traumatic event, reports Shapiro, and the fraternity insists it never held a a date function or social event on the weekend of Sept. 28, 2012, which is the date cited by Jackie in the Rolling Stone story. Rolling Stone has issued a statement apologizing for the story, which includes this misogynistic, victim-blaming line: In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackies account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced. ButJackie was a freshman in college when her episode allegedly took place; the story itself references her misgivings about putting her life into the public realm; she requested that Rolling Stone not contact Drew, the ringleader of the alleged assault; the alleged sequence of events  nine college men conspiring to attack a freshman and sexually assaulting her for three hours  should have triggered every skeptical twitch in the Rolling Stone staff. This disaster is the sole property of editors and a reporter. The story and Erdelys comments about it, moreover, suggest an effort to produce impact journalism. While media critics on the right and the left cry about media bias in just about every news cycle, the complaints generally amount to nothing but ideological posturing. There are few thingslike a good media-bias claim to distract from a substantive conversation. In the case, of Erdelys piece, however, theres ample evidence of poisonous biases that landed Rolling Stone in what should be an existential crisis. It starts with this business about choosing just the right school for the story. What is that all about? In his first, important piece on this story, the Washington Posts Paul Farhi described the authors thought process: So, for six weeks starting in June, Erdely interviewed students from across the country. She talked to people at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and her alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. None of those schools felt quite right. But one did: the University of Virginia, a public school, Southern and genteel, brimming with what Erdely calls super-smart kids and steeped in the legacy of its founder, Thomas Jefferson. A perfect place, in other words, to seta story about a gang rape. Observe how Erdely responded to a question about the accused parties in Jackies alleged gang rape. In that Slate podcast, whenasked who these people were, she responded, I dont want to say much about them as individuals but Ill just say that this particular fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi  its really emblematic in a lot of ways of sort of like elitist fraternity culture. Its considered to be a kind of top-tier fraternity at University of VirginiaIts considered to be a really high-ranking fraternity, in part because theyre just so incredibly wealthy. Their alumni are very influential, you know, theyre on Wall Street, theyre in politics. The next time Erdely writes a big story, shell have to do a better job of camouflaging her proclivity to stereotype. Here, she refuses to evaluate the alleged gang rapists as individuals, instead opting to fold them into the caricature of the elitist fraternity culture, and all its delicious implications. Of course, one of the reasons she didnt describe the accused is that she never reached out to them.      Rolling Stone has published a note to readers apologizing for an article about an alleged U-Va. sexual assault, saying new information shows discrepancies in the victim's story. (Reuters)   More grist comes from an Erdely interview with SiriusXM host Michael Smerconish. In a wide-ranging discussion, Erdely discussed some details of her reporting that didnt surface in the story.Erdely alleges Jackie had told her some chilling things about the run-up to the alleged gang rape. As lifeguards at the U-Va. pool. Jackie couldnt figure out why Drew was paying attention to her when the other female lifeguards were model-gorgeous blondes, said Erdely in the interview. He was paying so much attention to me, showing so much interest in everything I had to say, Erdely said, paraphrasing Jackie. And all she could think is that [Drew] was probably grooming her for something like this, and testing her for something like this. In a tale of hard-to-believe scenarios, this one distinguishes itself. Its plausible that the repeat rapists plaguing college campuses case out their victims. Yet as academicsDavid Lisak and Paul Miller note in their much-cited study Repeat Rape and Multiple OffendingAmong Undetected Rapists, the modus operandi of the serial campus rapist diverges from that of gang-rape orchestrator Drew: Given the number of interpersonal crimes being committed by these men, how is it thatthey are escaping the criminal justice system? The answer may lie, in part, in their choiceof victim and in their relative abnegation of gratuitous violence. By attacking victimswithin their social networks  so-called acquaintances  and by refraining from the kindof violence likely to produce physical injuries in their victims, these rapists create casesthat victims are least likely to report, and that prosecutors are less likely to prosecute. Under the scenario cited by Erdely, the Phi Kappa Psi members are not just criminal sexual-assault offenders, theyre criminal sexual-assault conspiracists, planners, long-range schemers. If this allegation alone hadnt triggered an all-out scramble at Rolling Stone for more corroboration, nothing would have. Anyone who touched this story  save newsstand personnel  should lose their job. The grooming anecdote indicates not only that Erdely believed whatever diabolical things about these frat guys told to her, she wanted to believe them. And then Rolling Stone published them. Aside from indicting Rolling Stone and setting back the fight against campus sexual assault, this episode affirms the importance of strong regional newspapers. After the Rolling Stone piece began to surface fissures, Washington Post local staff deployed to familiar turf, seeking out the folks that Rolling Stone had bypassed. The effort called on a weeks worth of reporting by Shapiro, the work of two researchers and the oversight of two editors. If Erdely had chosen some other campus, perhapsher skewed reporting wouldnt have attracted such scrutiny. Something to consider the next time a debate arises over whether The Post should sustain itslocal reporting."
The Washington Post,L,Obama makes Dec. 26 a holiday - The Washington Post," By Joe Davidson December 5 at 9:12 PM  Follow @JoeDavidsonWP   President Obama, aka boss-in-chief, decided to give federal employees a holiday present a little early. He issued an executive order Friday giving them the day after Christmas off.    President Obama and the first family stands, right, after lighting the 2014 National Christmas Tree during the National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony at the Ellipse near the White House in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014.

There was no indication if Obama was swayed by an online White House petition urging him to make the day a holiday. The petition said: Federal Employees have dealt with pay freezes and furloughs over the past few years. Giving federal employees an extra holiday on Dec. 26th, 2014 would be a good gesture to improve morale of the federal workforce. Some bases are forcing their employees to take leave or LWOP because of base shut-downs on this day. This is also consistent with past practice. President Obama provided a full-day Monday Dec. 24, 2012 and a half-day off on Thursday, Dec. 24, 2009. President George W. Bush provided a half-day holiday on Wednesday, Dec. 24, 2002, as well as several full days off the day before or after Christmas: Tuesday, December 24, 2001, Thursday, December 26, 2003, Tuesday, December 24, 2007, and Thursday, December 26, 2008.

The Washington Post,L,"The long, halting, still-unfinished fight to end racial profiling in America - The Washington Post"," By Emily Badger December 5 at 8:29 PM  Follow @emilymbadger      President Obama now has the chance to fulfill a promise originally made by George W. Bush: ending racial profiling in America. (AP)  In his very first address to Congress  in the speech where new presidents first detail their priorities for the nation  George W. Bush devoted a few moments to an unlikely topic: racial profiling. ""Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our nation's justice,"" he said, ""when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups instead of individuals."" The issue had, in fact, played into the 2000 election. The national news was full of stories of doctors and lawyers and NFL players stopped for ""driving while black,"" in seemingly every state from California to Massachusetts. Both candidates that year were asked in a presidential debate if they would support a federal law banning racial profiling, and they said they would. Before Congress, Bush was unequivocal. ""Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the attorney general, to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling,"" he announced. ""It's wrong, and we will end it in America."" More than a decade later, with a rare moment of bipartisan momentum long past, Bush's promise remains unfulfilled. Communitiesacross the country still chafe at the profiling they perceive in state immigration laws that allow police to disproportionately challengethe status of Hispanics, in surveillance of local Muslim communities, and in statistics showing that blacks are still interrogatedby police on the streetat a far higher rate than other groups. Black drivers, nationwide, are twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop. The consequences of this racial profiling are as evidentas ever: in the frayed relationships between police and minorities, in the deep distrust among minorities of the justice system, and in the racial tension in Ferguson, Mo.    A New York Civil Liberties Union analysis of stop-and-frisk data from the NYPD in 2011.  Now, President Obama and his soon-to-depart attorney general, Eric Holder, are coming closer to finishing the job that Bush started. The Post reported Friday evening that Holder plans next week to announce new Justice Department rules for racial profiling, banning its use in national security cases. ""The changes will also expand the definition of profiling to prevent FBI agents from considering factors such as religion and national origin when opening cases,"" The Post reported. However, in a sign thatthe United States is not endingracial profiling altogether, the new regulations will allow officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security to racially profile, including at airports and the southwest border. That may disappoint many civil rights activists who've waited over a decade for the new policies. (Full story here.) The administration's efforts are the culmination of 13 years of activism and debate. AfterBush declared that profiling was wrong in 2001, a bill was introduced in Congress, the End Racial Profiling Act, that attempted to make good on his promise. It required federal agencies to stop the practice, and local agencies that wanted federal money to do the same. By the fall of 2001, though  after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11  the will to tackle the issue waned. People who opposed profiling black drivers on New Jersey highways found they felt differently about profiling Muslim passengers at airports. When he came to office, Obama inherited much of the same problems that Bush described. Holder vowed to pick up where Ashcroft left off, putting the weight of the federal government more firmly behind a policy to eradicate racial profiling. Holder's promise, though, lingered for the last four years, the review of federal policy dragging on even as he announced he would step down from the department as soon as a new attorney general is confirmed. Civil-rights groups have grown anxious waiting for it, as several incidents  from the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., to the shooting of Michael Brown, to the death of Eric Garner  have fanned racial tensions across the country. On Monday, speaking in Atlanta about the tension that erupted in Ferguson, Holder hinted that he would finally announce such changes, unveiling ""rigorous new standards"" on the use of race by law enforcement  ""to help end racial profiling,"" he said, ""once and for all."" The new policy will beone of the last major accomplishments of Holder's tenure, a central pillar of his civil-rights legacy.      Speaking in the church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, Attorney General Eric Holder discussed the investigation into the Ferguson shooting, as well as a plan to reform law enforcement practices. (AP)   Gaping loopholes Civil-rights advocates did not get the federal law they sought under the Bush administration. (The End Racial Profiling Act has been introduced, to noeffect, in every Congress since). They did, however, eventually get an important document from the Department of Justice -- an 11-page""guidance regarding the use of race by federal law enforcement agencies."" In that 2003 decree by Ashcroft, the federal government for the first time defined racial profiling, and in stark terms: 'Racial profiling' at its core concerns the invidious use of race or ethnicity as a criterion in conducting stops, searches and other law enforcement investigative procedures. It is premised on the erroneous assumption that any particular individual of one race or ethnicity is more likely to engage in misconduct than any particular individual of another race or ethnicity. Racial profiling in law enforcement is not merely wrong, but also ineffective. Its use by law enforcement, the document said, also ""has a terrible cost"" to individuals and the nation's values. ""I think people were surprised that something like this could come out of John Ashcroft and the Bush Administration  pleasantly surprised,"" says Laura Murphy, director of the Washington Legislative Office of the American Civil Liberties Union. But the guidance, which prohibited racial profiling by federal law enforcement agencies, also contained some gaping loopholes, making it a valuable statement of principles but a hollow tool for enforcing them. First, the principles: The DOJ acknowledged that racial profiling is actually ineffective. This is especially noteworthy, since even today prominent officials have continued to dispute the idea, even if they don't usethe word ""profiling."" Up until the end of his tenure last year, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the city's aggressive stop-and-frisk program for disproportionately targeting the groups that he said commit disproportionate amounts of crime. Neither opponents of racial profiling northe 2003 federal guidance deny the right of law enforcement officers to use race in responding to specific descriptions of criminals. Officers don't have to ignore the race of a suspect if he's described as ""black, 5'10"", wearing a gray sweater."" Racial profiling, rather, refers more broadly to the kind of calculation Bloomberg was describing: That if officers stop more blacks, they will increase their chances of finding criminals, because criminals are more likely to be black.    A 2004 Gallup poll illustrates that American views on racial profiling depend on the context where it occurs.  That ""profiling hypothesis,"" as law professor David A. Harris puts it, has repeatedly been proven wrong. Harris' analyses have found that racial profiling actually makes police less accurate, not more so, in catching criminal activity. That's because it wastes resources on false positives among people police would never otherwise stop (black lawyers on their way to work), and because the focus on race diverts attention from the clues that actually do hint at criminal activity. ""If you want to know if somebody is involved in, say, transporting drugs on a highway, if you want to know whether somebody might be up to no good in an airport, you should watch with unrelenting intensity what they are doing, not what they look like  because thats the only good predictor,"" says Harris, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.  Harris often hears people justify profiling Arabs at airports as ""better safe than sorry."" But, in fact, by making law enforcement less accurate, Harris argues that profiling potentially makes communities less safe. And this effect is further compounded by the mistrust that arises in heavily profiled communities, where residents are wary of reporting crime or of cooperating with law enforcement. Ashcroft's 2003 guidance, however, also included important loopholes. Thedocument applied only to federal law enforcement agencies, not local ones. And it carved out exceptions for the two broad cases where profiling is most relevant to federal work: in national security and border integrity. DOJ's piercing language on the costs of racial profiling did not apply, in other words, to terrorism investigations, airport screenings or border patrol. They left open the ability for federal agencies like the FBI to map Muslim Americans living in Michigan, for example, to track potential terrorist threats. They granted wide latitude to Customs and Border Protection, which operates well inside the U.S. border. ""The exceptions were written so broadly that they basically swallowed the rule,"" says Farhana Khera, the executive director of the legal advocacy organization Muslim Advocates. Familiar numbers Shortly after protests began this summer in Ferguson, decrying unequal treatment of blacks by local police, numbers came out that seemed to supportthe protesters' point. Racial profiling data compiled by the Missouri attorney general found that black drivers were the target of 86 percent of traffic stops in the city last year, and 93 percent of traffic stops that ended in an arrest. By contrast, blacks make up 63 percent of the local population over 16.  Those numbers are not so different from data the ACLU compiled in the 1990s for a series of lawsuits that helped turn racial profiling into a national story and a subject of presidential debate. In one suit against the Illinois State Police, the ACLU found that Hispanics, who made up less than 1 percent of the driving-age population in several counties outside of St. Louis, made up nearly a third of stops there for speeding less than five miles over the speed limit. Similar disparities occurtoday far from St. Louis: In New York City, young black men in 2011 were involved in a quarter of stop-and-frisk cases, while making up less than 2 percent of the city's population. In Boston, police data show that blacks, who make up about a quarter of the city's population, were involved in 63 percent of encounters with police from 2007-2010. This critique doesn't necessarily imply that law enforcement should interact with each demographic group in exactproportion to its share of the population. But such extreme disparities reveal that police are stopping many minorities who've committed no crime, and leaving young black men in particular at risk when police stops escalate into deadly encounters. The numbers on continuing racial disparities in police profilingreflect the environment  and the anger  Holder inherited when he announced, in 2010, that the DOJ would review and update Ashcroft's original guidance. In the years since then, civil-rights advocates have lobbied intensely. They pushedHolder to eliminate the national and border security loopholes. They have pushedhim to add religious protections, too, to cover Muslims and Sikhs who've felt particularly targeted, often because of their appearance, since Sept. 11. They also wanted Holder to extend his reach to local law enforcement agencies, by insisting on the same anti-racial profiling standards for departments that receive federal resources, such as free hand-me-down military equipment, community-policing grants, or those body-camera funds Obama also announced this week. In many contexts, after all, Washington has used federal resources as leverage to influence local policy.As attorney general, Holder otherwise has no control over policies set by local police departments. (It is not clear if the new policy will require action of localities, though the new rules are expected to serve as guidance for local police.) Advocates have been repeating these requests for several years now, in new reports and open letters and public pleas. In recent days, as Holder prepared to finally announce the new standards, advocates said they wereanxious about what he wouldsay. ""They can repeat back to us everything that weve asked for, but they have not shared a draft, they have not said 'we can do this, but we cant do that,'"" saidMurphy of the ACLU earlier this week. ""They have been more tight-lipped about this policy than George Bushs Administration was when the guidance came out in 2003."" That reality suggests, ironically, that it may have been easier for John Ashcroft to denounce racial profiling in 2003  to declare that the American ""goal of 'liberty and justice for all' recedes with every act of such discrimination""  than for the nation's first black attorney general, and first black president, to say so today. ""Every time this administration tries to have a conversation about addressing racial problems in this society, theyve gotten slammed,"" Murphy says. ""Everything from the beer summit to Holders speech on we're cowards on issues of race  they just have been treated like no other administration. And I think its totally unfair, and its had the effect of chilling certain actions on their part."" "
The Washington Post,L,Five myths about Americas police - The Washington Post,"   Police officers at a Brooklyn Bridge exit ramp during protests on Thursday against the decision to not indict an officer for the chokehold death of Eric Garner. (John Minchillo/Associated Press)   December 5 at 11:26 AM     Radley Balko is the author of Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of Americas Police Forces and blogs for The Washington Post at The Watch.     Americas police forces are in the spotlight. After the police shooting deaths of Michael Brown  in Ferguson, Mo., and 12-year-old Tamir Rice  in Cleveland, as well as this past weeks decision by a grand jury not to indict the officer caught on video choking New York resident Eric Garner , who later died, Americans from the White House to the streets are debating or protesting police militarization, body cameras, lethal force  and whether enough is done to hold bad cops accountable. Its essential that we base these discussions on good data and sound presumptions. Police officers are human and fallible, just like the rest of us. How they behave and react in the aggregate is a product of the policies, procedures and guidelines set by police leadership, elected officials and ultimately the public. Here are five common misconceptions about policing today:  1. The job of a police officer is increasingly dangerous. According to FBI statistics, 27 police officers were feloniously killed in 2013, the lowest raw number in more than 50 years. (The previous low was 41 in 2008.) If we go by officer homicides as a percentage of active-duty police, it was probably the safest year in a century. The number of cops killed on duty has been falling since the mid-1990s, consistent with the overall drop in violent crime in America. Assaults against police officers have been in decline as well.          1 of 18       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                       Skip Ad              Myths of 2014    View Photos   Fact or fiction?

The most complete academic studies on the matter show that sanctions lead to concessions from the targeted government in one out of every three or four cases, writes Daniel W. Drezner in Five myths about sanctions. That is a far cry from never working. Here, President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel leave a joint news conference at the White House in May. The leaders discussed additional sanctions to punish Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. Charles Dharapak/AP  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.       We will probably see news stories in the coming weeks about a sharp increase in cops killed this year vs. 2013. Approximating from data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, it is likely that about 50 police officers will be killed this year. Thats certainly a sharp increase over the 27 last year, but even if that toll is reached, it would still be one of the lowest since the early 1960s and in line with the general decline since the mid-1990s. The average number of cops feloniously killed per year over the past decade: 51.1.  2. YouTube videos and cellphone footage prove that todays cops are out of control. Most criminologists believe that todays police departments are more professional than ever before. Cops tend to get more training, and departments are guided by defined rules and procedures. Most decent-size police agencies have internal affairs departments, and a growing number of cities have installed citizen review boards.  That hardly means there are no problems in policing today, of course, or that these developments suffice to safeguard civil liberties. But its likely that the ubiquity of cellphone cameras and the diffusive power of social media are simply making us more aware of rule-breaking cops, rather than showing that there are more of them than before. But even if there may be fewer rogue cops who abuse their authority and use force outside the bounds of department rules, its also true that, as a matter of policy, police use more force today than they have in the past. SWAT tactics, for example, are increasingly used for credit card fraud and other low-level offenses, administrative warrants, or even regulatory enforcement. Use-of-force training today puts less emphasis on conflict resolution and deescalation, if they are addressed at all. The problem isnt cops breaking the rules  the rules themselves are the problem.  3. With more criminals wielding heavy-duty weapons, police must militarize to catch up. Multiple studies, including from the Justice Department, have shown that the guns used in homicides, including the killing of police officers, overwhelmingly tend to be small-caliber handguns. Moreover, gun ownership has increased over the past 20 years  the same period in which both the violent crime rate and the killing of police officers have been in decline.  One version of this argument advanced recently by Vox and the New Republic is that we cant demilitarize the police without gun control. But even if it were true that criminals were arming themselves with bigger guns, it isnt clear that gun control would demilitarize the police. First, gun-control legislation would probably not do much to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals, particularly in the short term. Second, the argument assumes that the law enforcement community would accept such a bargain. That seems unlikely. Polls consistently show that large majorities of police officers oppose gun control, although big-city chiefs and the heads of some big police organizations support such policies. The NRA in particular includes a lot of cops in its membership and recently ran an article in favor of police militarization in its flagship magazine.  New gun-control laws may have other merits, but its unlikely that they would slow down the militarization of U.S. police. 4. Aggressive, confrontational policing is the best way to control crime. Proponents of police militarization sometimes point out that the trend has occurred at the same time that crime has dropped dramatically  therefore, militarization must be working. But criminologists are still debating what has caused the decline in crime since the mid-1990s. In New York, crime fell without mass incarceration. In San Diego, it dropped without the broken windows policing employed in New York.  Moreover, the most notable manifestation of militaristic policing is the SWAT team. According to Eastern Kentucky University criminologist Peter Kraska, the number of annual SWAT deployments in the United States jumped more than 1,500 percent between the early 1980s and 2000. Yet according to Kraskas data and a study this year from the American Civil Liberties Union, 60 to 80 percent of SWAT raids are to enforce warrants for drug crimes  and drug crimes are the one class of crime that hasnt dropped since the 1990s.  The good news is that in places where its been tried, community policing  which stresses de-escalation; community involvement; and solutions that dont always involve more arrests, more raids and more street sweeps  has succeeded.  It happened in the early 1970s in Washington, where crime fell under the leadership of Police Chief Jerry Wilson, a community-policing advocate, while it increased just about everywhere else. In California, by the time Police Chief Joseph McNamara retired in 1991, he had used community policing to make San Jose the safest big city in America  with a police force that per capita was one of the smallest in the country. More recently, as my Washington Post colleague Philip Bump pointed out this past week, the number of stop-and-frisks in New York City has dropped by an incredible 94 percent since 2011  with no noticeable effect on the crime rate.  5. Tasers and other less lethal weapons allow cops to use less force. New technology and new weapons are only as good as the policies guiding their use. Tasers were initially touted as a substitute for lethal force, a way for cops to subdue violent suspects without killing them. Over time, however, they have become a compliance tool  used to quell dissent, move nonviolent protesters and punish people for talking back. A 2011 National Institute of Justice study found that cops use their Tasers too often and in inappropriate circumstances. While there is no national data on Taser use, a 2012 Chicago Tribune report found that Taser use by suburban police doubled between 2008 and 2011. A 2011 New York Civil Liberties Union study found that nearly 60 percent of police Taser incidents in that state did not meet expert-recommended criteria for using the weapon. Its also worth noting that Amnesty International has documented more than 500 cases in which a suspect died after being shocked with a Taser. It would be one thing if all those stun gun barbs were being fired in place of bullets. But according to FBI statistics, the number of justifiable homicides by police has been increasing since about 2000. That data is also incomplete, but to the extent that its flawed, it probably undercounts such incidents.

The Washington Post,L,Special assistant Deric Ladnier hired by Diamondbacks - The Washington Post," By James Wagner December 5 at 4:31 PM  Follow @jameswagnerwp      Deric Ladnier, a special assistant to General Manager Mike Rizzo and one of the top scouts in the Nationals front office, was lured away by the Arizona Diamondbacks to serve as scouting director, the team announced on Friday afternoon. Ladnier hadspent the previous six seasons with the Nationals as a national crosschecker and special assistant to the GM. How many times do youget the chanceto go back and do what you did before and have the first pick in the draftagain and the challenges with it, too? Ladnier said. It directly changes the mold of the organization. To be able to do that again, not many get that chance. The Nationals hired Ladnier in 2008 after nine seasons as the senior director of scouting with the Royals. He oversaw the drafts that selected players that formed the backbone of the 2014 Royals World Series run, such as Eric Hosmer, Alex Gordon and Mike Moustakas. Before that, Ladnier spent eight seasons with the Braves in a variety of roles from scouting to player development. With the Nationals, Ladnier has had his hand in a variety of front office matters, from amateur scouting to intentional scouting to advance scouting. The Nationals were one of the best organizations Ive ever worked for, Ladnier said. Mike Rizzo, I cant say enough things about him as boss for me, how he treated me as a man and a baseball person. There are things that happen in life and you take out of it what you need. I learned how todo a draftfrom the Braves and Royals. Ladnier, 50, spoke highly of his time with the Nationals, and other front office officials such as Doug Harris and Kris Kline. But thechallenge of returning to an old position and shepherding the Diamondbacks draft efforts  they will pick first overall next summer  wasenticing. Ladnier joins a Diamondbacks front office that has ties to the Nationals. Assistant general manager Bryan Minniti left the Nationals for the same position in Arizona shortly after the season. In addition to his ties to Minniti, Ladnier was minor league roommates with De Jon Watson, both Royals prospects in 1985. Its unclear who will fill Ladniers vacant position, but last month, the Nationals hired two special assistants to the GM  Mike Cubbage and Terry Wetzel."
